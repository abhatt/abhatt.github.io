<p>This comes from a question posed to me and others in 2019 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Langerman">Stefan Langerman</a>, a computational geometer who also happens to be a diamond dealer. The classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brilliant_(diamond_cut)">brilliant cut</a> shape of diamonds has a flat “table” face on the top (visible) side of the gem, and many other smaller facets on the sides (“crown”) and back (“pavilion”), with angles chosen so that most of the light that enters through the table is reflected back out through the table, making the diamond look bright. Can we simulate this reflection process efficiently, without having to trace all the reflections of all (or a sufficiently dense sample of all) possible light rays?</p>

<p>This appears to be an interesting problem even for a very simple abstraction of the diamond’s shape: a two-dimensional isosceles triangle, with the base of the triangle as its table and the two equal sides as its pavilion. What you need to know about light reflections in gems is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_angle_(optics)">critical angle</a>, determined from the high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index">refractive index</a> of diamonds and other gems. Inside the gem, rays that hit a face at an angle shallower than the critical angle; rays that hit more steeply than the critical angle will escape. Any light ray hitting the table will always enter the gem, and will be refracted so that it enters along a ray steeper than the critical angle. It will then bounce around within the gem until it happens to hit a face steeply enough to escape. The question is to predict where this escape ray escapes, more quickly than the obvious algorithm of calculating explicitly the entire sequence of reflections that it performs? Or if not, can we at least provide good bounds on the lengths of these reflection sequences?</p>

<p>Three of the simplest cases involve the isosceles triangles for which the triangle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_tessellation">tiles the plane by copies reflected across its edges</a>, the equilateral triangle, isosceles right triangle, and 30-30-120 isosceles triangle. The path of a reflected light ray within such a triangle are combinatorially equivalent to the path of a straight line through this triangulation: they pass through the same types of edges, at the same angles.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="80%" alt="Reflection through many faces in a 30-30-120 gem" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/30-30-120.svg" /></p>

<p>For all three of these triangle shapes, a line that enters the gem through any edgethe table can only pass through a constant number of tiles in the tiling, before passing through another edge with the same angle, at which it must necessarily leave the gem (if it has not done so already). For instance, the red line shown, if it enters at its bottom left endpoint on the table of a green triangle, will exit after at most three reflections, through the parallel table of a blue triangle. The constant in the number of reflections here is absolute, not depending on the critical angle.</p>

<p>The next simplest case is the isosceles triangle with apex angle \(2\pi/5\). This triangle does not tile the plane, but we can still form a partial tiling by “unrolling” the path of reflections through the triangle into a line through a sequence of reflected triangles. In order to avoid exiting through one of the sides (by passing through it more perpendicularly than the entrance angle) and in order to miss the closest two copies of the table that are parallel to the entrance, there is only one passage that can be followed in the unrolled triangulation, the one shown by the red ray in the figure. Because this passage is perpendicular to one of the reflected sides of the triangle, a ray that is more perpendicular to the table than to this side can only continue for \(O(1)\) steps through this passage before hitting an exit. Here, though, the critical angle comes into play: critical angles that are closer to a right angle will allow larger (but constant) numbers of reflections.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="40%" alt="Reflection in a 2pi/5 isosceles triangle" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/pentagonal-isosceles-reflections.svg" /></p>

<p>Isosceles triangles with apex \(\pi/4\) are even messier. When a ray entering the table exits by a side, or exits by the table without first bouncing off the table, it always does so within $O(1)$ steps. The trickier cases are when a ray entering through the table misses the opposite table in the octagon formed by reflected copies of the triangle, and passes through a sequence of diagonal or horizontal reflections into other octagons before escaping. In the case that there are no horizontal reflections, only diagonal ones, we just need to divide the vertical distance that the ray needs to travel to hit the next row of vertical edges by the slope of the ray, and round. The case that there is at least one horizontal reflection (shown) is a little more compicated, but again appears to involve a finite calculation. So it seems that with a little more calculation it is still possible to determine algorithmically what happens in this case, in constant time rather than having to simulate the unbounded number of bounces triangle-by-triangle.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/octagonal-reflex.svg" alt="Reflection in a pi/4 isosceles triangle" /></p>

<p>All of these triangles have angles that are rational multiples of \(2\pi\). For reflections within polygons of this type, the reflected line will only pass through a constant number of slopes. The rays of a single slope that hit a given line of the polygon can be describes as an interval, and the mapping on rays that takes each ray starting on one of the sides with one of these slopes to the start of its next reflection is a special kind of mapping studied in the theory of dynamical systems, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_exchange_transformation">interval exchange transformation</a>. So from a geometric question on ray-tracing, we are led to a more abstract question: given an interval exchange transformation, and a starting point in that transformation, how easy is it to determine the number of times one would need to repeat the transformation to return back to the same interval?</p>

<p>I have no real progress to report on any of these questions, in part because the continuous nature of these problems lead to difficult numerical issues. Instead, I have a new arXiv preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11607">“The Complexity of Iterated Reversible Computation” (arXiv:2112.11607
)</a> on related but more combinatorial problems. Suppose one has an invertible mapping \(f\) on a finite (but exponentially large) set of states, that is easy to compute, such as an interval exchange transformation on integers rather than real numbers. Suppose also that you want to repeat this mapping for a given initial state \(x\) and a large number \(n\) of steps. Is there anything you can do to compute the result \(f^{(n)}(x)\) of this iterated mapping, more efficiently than the obvious method of just computing \(x\), \(f(x)\), \(f(f(x))\), one step at a time? One property that appears highly relevant here is that these mappings are reversible: they are one-to-one, and more strongly the inverse mapping is also an interval exchange transformation. In contrast, it is easy to find mappings that are not reversible and for which computing iterated values is \(\mathsf{PSPACE}\)-complete: consider, for instance, the state transition map of a space-bounded Turing machine.</p>

<p>For some similar systems, we do know of effective methods in practice if not in theory. For Conway’s Game of Life, for instance, it appears to be \(\mathsf{PSPACE}\)-complete to compute what happens to an initial state after \(n\) steps (although I’m not sure this exact claim has been published in the literature), but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashlife">hashlife</a> (as implemented in <a href="http://golly.sourceforge.net/">Golly</a>) can run many complicated and large patterns in an amount of runtime substantially less than the number of generated steps. The Game of Life is not reversible, but some other interesting cellular automata with similar behavior such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critters_(cellular_automaton)">Critters</a> are. Can we say anything about the computational complexity of simulating Critters or other reversible rules? My new paper addresses these questions by formulating a complexity class that includes computing \(f^{(n)}(x)\) for reversible cellular automaton simulation, integer interval exchange transformations, and others. It sandwiches this class between \(\mathsf{P}^{\mathsf{PH}}\) and \(\mathsf{PSPACE}\), and finds complete problems for it including the simulation of reversible cellular automata and of piecewise linear tranformations. The complete cellular automata include the two-dimensional billiard ball model, already known for its ability to simulate reversible circuits, and a new one-dimensional automata that can simulate some two-dimensional automata including the billiard ball model. Because Critters can in turn simulate the billiard ball model, it is also complete in the same sense. But I wasn’t able to prove completeness for integer interval exchange transformations, let alone say anything useful about the non-integer transformations needed to understand diamond reflections.</p>

shortest path problem, which is also known as the single-source many targets
shortest path problem (SSMTSP). Given a directed graph with non-negative edge
weights, our goal is to compute a shortest path from a given source node to any
of several designated target nodes. Basically, our idea is to combine a machine
learning approach with an adapted version of Dijkstra's algorithm to solve this
problem: Based on the trace of Dijkstra's algorithm, we design a neural network
that predicts the shortest path distance after only a few iterations. The
prediction is then used to prune the search space explored by Dijkstra's
algorithm, which allows us to save a significant fraction of operations on the
underlying priority queue. Crucially, our approach always computes the exact
shortest path distances, even if the prediction is inaccurate, and never uses
more queue operations than the standard algorithm. In fact, we are able to
prove a lower bound on the number of queue operations saved by our new
algorithm, which depends on the accuracy of the prediction. Our bound applies
to arbitrary graphs as long as (some of) the edge weights are drawn at random.
Our experimental findings on random graphs confirm these bounds and show that
the actual savings are oftentimes significantly higher.

multiparameter persistence modules. This invariant is useful in theory -- it
completely determines the Hilbert function of the module and the isomorphism
type of the free modules in its minimal free resolution -- as well as in
practice -- it is sometimes easy to visualize and it is one of the main outputs
of current multiparameter persistent homology software, such as RIVET. However,
to the best of our knowledge, no bottleneck stability result with respect to
the interleaving distance has been established for this invariant so far, and
this potential lack of stability limits its practical applications. We prove a
stability result for multigraded Betti numbers, using an efficiently computable
bottleneck-type dissimilarity function we introduce. Our notion of matching is
inspired by recent work on signed barcodes, and allows matching of bars of the
same module in homological degrees of different parity, as well as for
matchings of bars of different modules in homological degrees of the same
parity. Our stability result is a combination of Hilbert's syzygy theorem,
Bjerkevik's bottleneck stability for free modules, and a novel stability result
for projective resolutions. We also prove, in the $2$-parameter case, a
$1$-Wasserstein stability result for Hilbert functions with respect to the
$1$-presentation distance of Bjerkevik and Lesnick.

bounds as a function of the prediction error. In this paper, we study online
graph problems with predictions. Our contributions are the following:
</p>
<p>* The first question is defining prediction error. For graph/metric problems,
there can be two types of error, locations that are not predicted, and
locations that are predicted but the predicted and actual locations do not
coincide exactly. We design a novel definition of prediction error called
metric error with outliers to simultaneously capture both types of errors,
which thereby generalizes previous definitions of error that only capture one
of the two error types.
</p>
<p>* We give a general framework for obtaining online algorithms with
predictions that combines, in a "black box" fashion, existing online and
offline algorithms, under certain technical conditions. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first general-purpose tool for obtaining online
algorithms with predictions.
</p>
<p>* Using our framework, we obtain tight bounds on the competitive ratio of
several classical graph problems as a function of metric error with outliers:
Steiner tree, Steiner forest, priority Steiner tree/forest, and
uncapacitated/capacitated facility location.
</p>
<p>Both the definition of metric error with outliers and the general framework
for combining offline and online algorithms are not specific to the problems
that we consider in this paper. We hope that these will be useful for future
work in this domain.

guarantee the connectivity of certain pairs of nodes despite the failure of a
few edges or nodes. A celebrated result by Jain [Combinatorica'01] provides a
2-approximation for a wide class of these problems. However nothing better is
known even for very basic special cases, raising the natural question whether
any improved approximation factor is possible at all.
</p>
<p>In this paper we address one of the most basic problems in this family for
which 2 is still the best-known approximation factor, the Forest Augmentation
Problem (FAP): given an undirected unweighted graph (that w.l.o.g. is a forest)
and a collection of extra edges (links), compute a minimum cardinality subset
of links whose addition to the graph makes it 2-edge-connected. Several
better-than-2 approximation algorithms are known for the special case where the
input graph is a tree, a.k.a. the Tree Augmentation Problem (TAP). Recently
this was achieved also for the weighted version of TAP, and for the
k-edge-connectivity generalization of TAP. These results heavily exploit the
fact that the input graph is connected, a condition that does not hold in FAP.
</p>
<p>In this paper we breach the 2-approximation barrier for FAP. Our result is
based on two main ingredients. First, we describe a reduction to the Path
Augmentation Problem (PAP), the special case of FAP where the input graph is a
collection of disjoint paths. Our reduction is not approximation preserving,
however it is sufficiently accurate to improve on a factor 2 approximation.
Second, we present a better-than-2 approximation algorithm for PAP, an open
problem on its own. Here we exploit a novel notion of implicit credits which
might turn out to be helpful in future related work.

us to mathematically investigate computation and answer many interesting
queries about the nature of computational problems. It provides theoretical
tools to assess time and space requirements of computations along with
assessing the difficultly of problems - classifying them accordingly. It also
garners at its core one of the most important problems in mathematics, namely,
the $\textbf{P vs. NP}$ millennium problem. In essence, this problem asks
whether solution and verification reside on two different levels of difficulty.
In this thesis, we introduce some of the most central concepts in the Theory of
Computing, giving an overview of how computation can be abstracted using Turing
machines. Further, we introduce the two most famous problem complexity classes
$\textbf{P}$ and $\textbf{NP}$ along with the relationship between them. In
addition, we explicate the concept of problem reduction and how it is an
essential tool for making hardness comparisons between different problems.
Later, we present the problem of Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) which lies at the
center of NP-complete problems. We then explore some of its tractable as well
as intractable variants such as Horn-SAT and 3-SAT, respectively. Last but not
least, we establish polynomial-time reductions from 3-SAT to some of the famous
NP-complete graph problems, namely, Clique Finding, Hamiltonian Cycle Finding,
and 3-Coloring.

quantum software, research and industrial communities have been trying to
discover new applications of quantum algorithms such as quantum optimization
and machine learning. Regardless of which hardware platform these novel
algorithms operate on, whether it is adiabatic or gate based, from theoretical
point of view, they are performing drastically better than their classical
counterparts. Two promising areas of quantum algorithms quantum machine
learning and quantum optimization. These are based on performing matrix
operations using quantum states and operation, in order to speed up data
analysis where quantum computing can efficiently work with high dimensional
vectors. Motivated by that, quantum inspired algorithms (e.g. for
recommendation systems and principal component analysis) are developed to cope
with high dimensionality using probabilistic techniques that are inspire from
quantum computing. In this paper we review recent progress in the area of
quantum inspired algorithms for low rank matrix approximation. We further
explore the possibility of using parametrized complexity for such algorithms to
refine practical complexity analysis. Finally, we conjecture that quantum
inspired algorithms that use low rank approximation and also sample and query
technique for input representations are Fixed Parameter Tractable (FPT).

variables (identified with the vertices); a Bayesian Network Distribution (BND)
is a probability distribution on the rv's that is Markovian on the graph. A
finite mixture of such models is the projection on these variables of a BND on
the larger graph which has an additional "hidden" (or "latent") random variable
$U$, ranging in $\{1,\ldots,k\}$, and a directed edge from $U$ to every other
vertex.
</p>
<p>Models of this type are fundamental to research in Causal Inference, where
$U$ models a confounding effect. One extremely special case has been of
longstanding interest in the theory literature: the empty graph. Such a
distribution is simply a mixture of $k$ product distributions. A longstanding
problem has been, given the joint distribution of a mixture of $k$ product
distributions, to identify each of the product distributions, and their mixture
weights. Our results are:
</p>
<p>(1) We improve the sample complexity (and runtime) for identifying mixtures
of $k$ product distributions from $\exp(O(k^2))$ to $\exp(O(k \log k))$. This
is almost best possible in view of a known $\exp(\Omega(k))$ lower bound.
</p>
<p>(2) We give the first algorithm for the case of non-empty graphs. The
complexity for a graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ is $\exp(O(k(\Delta^2 + \log
k)))$.
</p>
<p>(The above complexities are approximate and suppress dependence on secondary
parameters.)

given application workload is important in reducing the computational
foot-print during run-time. In edge or on-premise clouds, cold-start
rightsizing the cluster at the time of installation is crucial in avoiding the
recurrent capital expenditure. In both these cases, rightsizing has to balance
cost-performance trade-off for a given application with multiple tasks, where
each task can demand multiple resources, and the cloud offers nodes with
different capacity and cost. Multidimensional bin-packing can address this
cold-start rightsizing problem, but assumes that every task is always active.
In contrast, real-world tasks (e.g. load bursts, batch and dead-lined tasks
with time-limits) may be active only during specific time-periods or may have
dynamic load profiles. The cluster cost can be reduced by reusing resources via
time sharing and optimal packing. This motivates our generalized problem of
cold-start rightsizing for time-limited tasks: given a timeline, time-periods
and resource demands for tasks, the objective is to place the tasks on a
minimum cost cluster of nodes without violating node capacities at any time
instance. We design a baseline two-phase algorithm that performs penalty-based
mapping of task to node-type and then, solves each node-type independently. We
prove that the algorithm has an approximation ratio of O(D min(m, T)), where D,
m and T are the number of resources, node-types and timeslots, respectively. We
then present an improved linear programming based mapping strategy, enhanced
further with a cross-node-type filling mechanism. Our experiments on synthetic
and real-world cluster traces show significant cost reduction by LP-based
mapping compared to the baseline, and the filling mechanism improves further to
produce solutions within 20% of (a lower-bound to) the optimal solution.

algorithm for groups (Brachter &amp; Schweitzer, LICS 2020) serves as a unifying
isomorphism test for several families of groups that were previously shown to
be in $\mathsf{P}$ by multiple methods. This includes coprime extensions where
the normal Hall subgroup is Abelian and the complement is $O(1)$-generated
(Qiao, Sarma, &amp; Tang, STACS 2011), and groups with no Abelian normal subgroups
(Babai, Codenotti, &amp; Qiao, ICALP 2012). In both of these cases, the previous
strategy involved identifying key group-theoretic structure that could then be
leveraged algorithmically, resulting in different algorithms for each family. A
common theme among these is that the group-theoretic structure is mostly about
the action of one group on another. Our main contribution is to show that a
single, combinatorial algorithm (Weisfeiler-Leman) can identify those same
group-theoretic structures in polynomial time.
</p>
<p>We also derive consequences for the parallel complexity of testing
isomorphism in these families. In particular, we show that constant-dimensional
Weisfeiler-Leman only requires a constant number of rounds to identify groups
in the above classes. Combining this result with the parallel Weisfeiler-Leman
implementation of Grohe &amp; Verbitsky for graphs (ICALP 2006), this puts
isomorphism testing for each of these families of groups into
$\mathsf{TC}^{0}$. However, we show that count-free Weisfeiler-Leman is not
strong enough to put isomorphism testing even for Abelian groups into
$\mathsf{AC}^0$.

<p>In the following January, Harvard GSAS kindly supports me to offer a <a href="https://cnchou.github.io/mini-course" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mini-course on <em>“What is Computation? From Turing Machines to Blackholes and Neurons”</em></a>. In this blog post, I’m going to share the motivation for teaching this mini-course and give an overview on what you will learn if you are interested in participating!</p>



<p>Computation is not an exotic word for people living in the 21st century. In high school, kids have to learn and do all sorts of computations in arithmetics (and some even start to write computer programs!). For scientists, computational methods become more and more common and sometimes even completely change the paradigm of a field. There are computers of different forms hiding in our daily life ranging from your smartphones to the toy of your pets. Also, from time to time we see excitement on the news about the development of quantum computing and artificial intelligence. Computation has become central in human civilization, however, do we really understand what computation is?</p>



<p>Let me first convince you why asking and attempting to answer this question is important.</p>



<p>Traditionally, at least on Wikipedia, computation is defined as <em>“any type of calculation that includes both arithmetical and non-arithmetical steps and which follows a well-defined model (e.g. an algorithm)”</em>. Indeed, for computer scientists and mathematicians, computation is about solving <em>computational problems</em> via an abstract mathematical model known as <em>Turing machine</em>. In particular, the <em>Church-Turing Thesis</em>, which can be viewed as Newton’s laws in computer science, asserts that all effective computational methods in the world can be captured by Turing machines. That is to say, in the mathematical world, computation is something axiomatized and can be studied and understood parallel to the empirical world.</p>



<p>On the other hand, for the majority of people, computation is something more concrete and has a physical realization such as a digital computer. The rise of computer science in the past few decades is certainly owing to the great technological success of building up modern computers. The fascinating advances of technology seem to close the gap between theory and reality (similar to Newton’s laws!). Nevertheless, in the frontier of scientific research, the recent surging developments of quantum computing and artificial neural networks started to challenge our understanding in computation – the ways they compute are so different from the traditional Turing machines and we don’t really know why and how they work so well!</p>



<p>In my opinion, we need to revisit the notion of computation in order to attack these mysteries. Specifically, the approach should be interdisciplinary.</p>



<p>As computer scientists are used to think of computations as composing different <em>resources</em> and <em>subroutines</em>, the computations in physics and biology tend to be rather <em>holistic</em> and <em>open-ended</em>. When talking about computations, people from different fields often think a bit differently. Such distinctions across fields should not be barriers or problems, instead, it could potentially serve as seeds to enrich our understanding in the essence of computation.</p>



<p>This mini-course is an invitation to rethink about what computation is through different angles. We will focus on but not limit to three perspectives including mathematics, physics, and biology. Through theories, examples, and experiments, we are going to see the similarities and differences between these disciplines. Six guest speakers coming from a diverse background (from computer science and physics to neuroscience and modern art) will join us and provide lots of examples and stories from their home field. The aim of this mini-course is to remind people of the diverse nature of computation and envision the possibilities of future interdisciplinary research.</p>



<p>There will be three modules and each contains three 50-minute interactive lectures and 1-3 guest talk(s). The first module focuses on the mathematical foundation of computations in which the students will learn the concept of Turing machines, computability, reductions, and most importantly, the underlying philosophy. The second module is about the computations in the physical world where we will launch from classical mechanics, to statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and gravity. The third module looks into the computations in biology, ranging from genomes, evolution, to neuroscience. The mini-course will end with a panel discussion with all the guest speakers and students.</p>

<p>Ordinary radix systems for representing numbers, like binary or decimal, use fixed finite sets of digits. The same is true for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective_numeration">bijective numeration</a>, used for columns of spreadsheets. In bijective numbering, every string of digits represents a unique number, shorter strings represent smaller numbers, and strings of equal length have the usual order. In spreadsheets, the digits are letters A–Z, one-letter strings represent numbers \(1\) through \(26\), two-letter strings represent \(27\) through \(26+26^2=702\), etc. Instead, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_radix">mixed radix</a> systems like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial_number_system">factorial number system</a> have position-varying digit sets.  In factorial numbering, the \(i\)th digit can range from \(0\) to \(i-1\), with place value \((i-1)!\). The value of a digit string is the sum of digits times place values. One could combine these ideas and get a bijective factorial number system, in which strings of at most \(i\) digits can represent numbers up to the <a href="https://oeis.org/A007489">sum of the first \(i\) factorials</a>. But in all of these mixed radix systems, the digits are not drawn from a finite set. Maybe we need another numbering system just to describe each digit of a mixed-radix number? This leads to the idea of a <em>recursive</em> numbering system, where the digits of a mixed-radix system are themselves numbers in the same system.</p>

<p>An example might clarify this idea. Let’s start with a recursive numbering system based on binary. Like other mixed-radix systems, we’ll number the digit positions starting with \(i=0\) at the right. Each position has a place value, the product of the numbers of choices for earlier digits, and the value of a sequence of digits is the sum of digits times place value. We’ll start with two choices of digit in position \(0\), like binary, and in later positions we’ll use the values we’ve already constructed as allowable digits.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In position \(i=0\), the two available digits given in the base case are \(0\) and \(1\), allowing us to represent only the numbers \(0\) and \(1\) as one-digit strings.</li>
  <li>In position \(i=1\), there are still only two digits available, the two numbers \(0\) and \(1\) that have shorter representations. In this position, they have place value \(2\), allowing any number from \(0\) to \(3\) to be represented as a two-digit string.</li>
  <li>In position \(i=2\), we now have four digits available, the numbers from \(0\) to \(3\). These have place value \(4\), allowing any number from \(0\) to \(15\) to be represented with three digits.</li>
</ul>

<p>At each successive level of this structure, the number of available digits and place values will be equal. Each new digit squares the range of representable numbers. In any position \(i&gt;0\), we will have \(2^{2^{i-1}}\) digits available, with place value \(2^{2^{i-1}}\), allowing any number from \(0\) to \(2^{2^{i}}-1\) to be represented. In some sense, though, we haven’t done anything very interesting yet. Like binary, we just get powers of two. The recursive-binary representation of a number can be obtained in a trivial way from its binary representation, by partitioning the bits into groups of 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, … bits.</p>

<p>Instead, a bijective numbering system leads to more interesting results when handled recursively. For recursive bijective numbering, we can start with a much simpler base case, the empty string, which can be interpreted in any bijective numbering system as representing the number \(0\). With this base case, we can define a bijective numbering system in which the available digits in position \(i\) (starting from \(i=0\) in the rightmost digit) are the numbers that can be represented by strings of length at most \(i\):</p>
<ul>
  <li>In position \(i=0\), there is only one available digit, the number \(0\) (already represented by the empty string), producing only one single-digit value, representing the number \(1\).</li>
  <li>In position \(i=1\), there are two available digits, the numbers \(0\) and \(1\) that we have already represented, so there are two two-digit sequences possible, representing two more numbers \(2\) and \(3\).</li>
  <li>In position \(i=2\), there are four available digits, providing eight three-digit sequences that can represent the numbers \(4\) through \(11\).</li>
</ul>

<p>If we let \(n_i\) denote the number of values that can be obtained by strings of exactly \(i\) digits, then we obtain a recurrence \(n_0=1\) (the zero-length strings represent only one value, zero) and \(n_i=n_{i-1}\sum_{j&lt;i}n_j\) (there are \(n_{i-1}\) choices for the string up to its last digit, and \(\sum_{j&lt;i}n_j\) choices for the last digit). This recurrence has the sequence of values <a href="http://oeis.org/A001697">1, 1, 2, 8, 96, 10368, 108615168, …</a> and its partial sums <a href="http://oeis.org/A001696">1, 2, 4, 12, 108, 10476, 108625644, …</a> give the total number of values that can be represented by strings of up to \(i\) digits.</p>

<p>The same idea can be represented graphically. Given a number represented by this recursive bijective numbering system, draw an ordered tree, where an \(i\)-digit number is represented by a tree whose root has \(i\) children, one for each digit, and where each digit is represented in the same way by a subtree. Conversely, if we have an ordered tree, we can think of it as representing a recursive bijective number, whose digits are computed recursively from the children of the root. In our recursive bijective numbers, we required that each digit be representable as a string of length at most its position; translating this requirement into tree terminology, each node that is the \(i\)th child of its parent (again starting with \(i=0\) on the right) must have degree at most \(i\).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="60%" alt="Equivalence between recursive bijective numbering and tree enumeration" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/recursive-bijective.svg" /></p>

<p>It follows that the sequences of numbers of representable values for \(i\)-digit strings and for \(\le i\)-digit strings, above, also give the numbers of ordered trees that obey this degree constraint, with root degree \(i\) or \(\le i\), respectively.</p>

<p>I’m about to leave for a family vacation—our first such since before the pandemic, one planned and paid for literally the day before the news of Omicron broke.  On the negative side, staring at the case-count graphs that are just now going vertical, I estimate a ~25% chance that at least one of us will get Omicron on this trip.  On the positive side, I estimate a ~60% chance that in the next 6 months, at least one of us would’ve gotten Omicron or some other variant even <em>without</em> this trip—so maybe it’s just as well if we get it now, when we’re vaxxed to the maxx and ready and school and university are out.</p>



<p>If, however, I <em>do</em> end this trip dead in an ICU, I wouldn’t want to do so without having clearly set out my values for posterity.  So with that in mind: in the comments of my <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6146">previous post</a>, someone asked me why I identify as a liberal or a progressive, if I passionately support educational practices like tracking, ability grouping, acceleration, and (especially) <em>encouraging kids to learn advanced math whenever they’re ready for it</em>.  (Indeed, that might be my single stablest political view, having been held, for recognizably similar reasons, since I was about 5.)</p>



<p>Incidentally, that previous post was guest-written by my colleagues Edith Cohen and Boaz Barak, and linked to an <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home">open letter</a> that now has almost 1500 signatories.  Our goal was, and is, to fight the imminent dumbing-down of precollege math education in the United States, spearheaded by the so-called “California Mathematics Framework.”  In our joint efforts, we’ve been careful with every word—making sure to maintain the assent of our entire list of signatories, to attract broad support, to stay narrowly focused on the issue at hand, and to bend over backwards to concede much as we could.  Perhaps because of those cautions, we—amazingly—got some actual traction, reaching people in government (such as Rep. Ro Khanna, D – Silicon Valley) and technology leaders, and forcing the “no one’s allowed to take Algebra in 8th grade” faction to respond to us.</p>



<p>This was disorienting to me.  On this blog, I’m used just to howling into the wind, having some agree, some disagree, some take to Twitter to denounce me, but in any case, having no effect of any kind on the real world.  </p>



<p>So let me return to howling into the wind.  And return to the question of what I “am” in ideology-space, which doesn’t have an obvious answer.</p>



<p>It’s like, what do you call someone who’s absolutely terrified about global warming, and who thinks the best response would’ve been (and actually, still is) a historic surge in nuclear energy, possibly with geoengineering to tide us over?</p>



<p>… who wants to end world hunger … and do it using GMO crops?</p>



<p>… who wants to smash systems of entrenched privilege in college admissions … and believes that the SAT and other standardized tests are the best tools ever invented for that purpose?</p>



<p>… who feels a personal distaste for free markets, for the triviality of what they so often elevate and the depth of what they let languish, but tolerates them because they’ve done more than anything else to lift up the world’s poor?</p>



<p>… who’s happiest when telling the truth for the cause of social justice … but who, if told to <em>lie</em> for the cause of social justice, will probably choose silence or even, if pushed hard enough, truth?</p>



<p>… who wants to legalize marijuana and psychedelics, and <em>also</em> legalize all the promising treatments currently languishing in FDA approval hell?</p>



<p>… who feels little attraction to the truth-claims of the world’s ancient religions, <em>except</em> insofar as they sometimes serve as prophylactics against newer and now even more virulent religions?</p>



<p>… who thinks the covid response of the CDC, FDA, and other authorities was a historic disgrace—not because it infringed on the personal liberties of antivaxxers or anything like that, but on the contrary, because it was weak, timid, bureaucratic, and slow, where it should’ve been like that of a general at war?</p>



<p>… who thinks the Nazi Holocaust was <em>even worse</em> than the mainstream holds it to be, because in addition to the staggering, one-lifetime-isn’t-enough-to-internalize-it human tragedy, the Holocaust <em>also</em> sent up into smoke whatever cultural process had just produced Einstein, von Neumann, Bohr, Szilard, Born, Meitner, Wigner, Haber, Pauli, Cantor, Hausdorff, Ulam, Tarski, Erdös, and Noether, and with it, one of the wellsprings of our technological civilization?</p>



<p>… who supports free speech, to the point of proudly tolerating views that <em>really, actually</em> disgust them at their workplace, university, or online forum?</p>



<p>… who believes in patriotism, the police, the rule of law, to the extent that they don’t understand why all the enablers of the January 6 insurrection, up to and including Trump, aren’t currently facing trial for treason against the United States?</p>



<p>… who’s (of course) disgusted to the core by Trump and everything he represents, but who’s <em>also</em> disgusted by the elite virtue-signalling hypocrisy that made the rise of a Trump-like backlash figure predictable?</p>



<p>… who not only supports abortion rights, but also looks forward to a near future when parents, if they choose, are free to use embryo selection to make their children happier, smarter, healthier, and free of life-crippling diseases (unless the “bioethicists” destroy that future, as a previous generation of Deep Thinkers destroyed our nuclear future)?</p>



<p>… who, when reading about the 1960s Sexual Revolution, instinctively sides with free-loving hippies and against the scolds … even if today’s scolds are themselves former hippies, or intellectual descendants thereof, who now clothe their denunciations of other people’s gross, creepy sexual desires in the garb of feminism and social justice?</p>



<p>What, finally, do you call someone whose image of an ideal world might include a young Black woman wearing a hijab, an old Orthodox man with black hat and sidecurls, a broad-shouldered white guy from the backwoods of Alabama, and a trans woman with purple hair, face tattoos and a nose ring … all of them standing in front of a blackboard and arguing about what would happen if Alice and Bob jumped into opposite ends of a wormhole?</p>



<p>Do you call such a person “liberal,” “progressive,” “center-left,” “centrist,” “Pinkerite,” “technocratic,” “neoliberal,” “libertarian-ish,” “classical liberal”?  Why not simply call them “correct”? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt="🙂" /></p></div>

Jonathan Borwein passed away a few years ago. He had been one of the top experts on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%3D3.141592653%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\pi=3.141592653\dots}" class="latex" /> and especially its computation. He also was a close associate of David Bailey, and they had been prominent advocates of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_mathematics">experimental</a> <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/uexm20">mathematics</a>. </p>
<p>
Today we talk about the hardness of predicting mathematical and computational advances.</p>
<p>
Borwein wrote a wonderful <a href="https://www.carma.newcastle.edu.au/resources/jon/future.pdf">article</a> on the future of mathematics. It was titled “The Future of Mathematics: 1965 to 2065” and was written for the 2015 centenary of the <a href="https://www.maa.org/">MAA</a>, midway in his range of time. </p>
<p>
Thus, his article looked forward by first looking backward at what would have been looking forward back then. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Prediction is Hard </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Borwein talks about predicting the future and how hard it is. He does this by listing a few predictions that were not correct: </p>
<ul>
<li>
“Radio has no future. Heavier than air flying machines are impossible. X-rays will prove to be a hoax.” — William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), English physicist and inventor, 1899. <p></p>
</li><li>
“This telephone has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication. The device is inherently of no value to us.” — Western Union internal memo, 1876. <p></p>
</li><li>
“Folks, the Mac platform is through— totally.” — John Dvorak, <em>PC Magazine</em>, 1998. <p></p>
</li><li>
“The problem with television is that people must sit and keep their eyes glued on a screen; the average American family hasn’t time for it.”— New York Times, 1949. <p></p>
</li><li>
“Where … the ENIAC is equipped with 18,000 vacuum tubes and weights 30 tons, computers in the future may have only 1,000 vacuum tubes and weigh only 1.5 tons.” — <i>Popular Mechanics</i>, 1949.
</li></ul>
<p>
Ken’s favorites are ones that have long been technologically feasible but never became economical. An example is that in 1959, Arthur Summerfield—then US Postmaster General—<a href="https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/missile-mail.pdf">predicted</a> that in a a few years, bulk canisters of air mail would be sent across oceans in hours by intercontinental missile. This was said without any inkling of e-mail. And whereas e-mail is “non-physical,” our physical packages arrive no faster than 60 years ago—indeed slower with this year’s supply-chain issues at Pacific ports. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/12/19/favorite-theorems-of-the-next-ten-years/missilemail2/" rel="attachment wp-att-19432"><img width="277" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MissileMail2.jpg?resize=277%2C240&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-19432" height="240" /></a></p>
<p></p><h2> Why Are Predictions Hard? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
One reason the future is hard to predict is that we tend to make predictions that are too conservative. For example: replace the last prediction by:</p>
<p>
“Where … the ENIAC is equipped with 18,000 vacuum tubes and weights 30 tons, computers in the future may weigh <b>one</b> pound.”</p>
<p>
The trouble is people would have laughed at this as ridiculous. How could 30 tons be reduced to a single pound? Indeed.</p>
<p>
Of course today people are talking about computers that weight almost nothing and can flow through your bloodstream. See <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/these-tiny-robots-could-be-disease-fighting-machines-inside-body-ncna861451">nanobots</a>. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/12/19/favorite-theorems-of-the-next-ten-years/nano/" rel="attachment wp-att-19420"><img width="160" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/nano.png?resize=160%2C80&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-19420" height="80" /></a></p>
<p>
A year ago, we <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2020/12/10/the-future-of-mathematics/">covered</a> a paper and <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020/slides/fomm_buzzard.pdf">slides</a> by Kevin Buzzard titled, “The future of mathematics?” His third slide embeds a hint on what makes prediction hard:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/12/19/favorite-theorems-of-the-next-ten-years/s/" rel="attachment wp-att-19421"><img width="320" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/s.png?resize=320%2C205&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-19421" height="205" /></a></p>
<p>
The key is what he says about AI advances coming in a <em>phase change</em>. A phase change is different from a bolt-from-the-blue. Before the change, the situation seems to be one that is well understood to be progressing slowly. Then a year passes, and boom. Again what happens is that predictions that seemed to be well-founded are exposed as too conservative. </p>
<p>
Understanding how this supplements the bolt-from-the-blue kind of event leads to the conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The future is whippy. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
And that is why predictions are hard.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Some Predictions </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Nevertheless, we wish to make a few predictions ourselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The P versus NP problem will be solved by the following date: 2032 <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\pm 10}" class="latex" /> years. We make no prediction which way it is resolved. (This is squarely within the 2030-to-2040 range that Ken gave in 2002 in Bill Gasarch’s first P=NP <a href="https://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs4104/heath/Spring2006/Resources/PversusNPpoll.pdf">poll</a>.) <p></p>
</li><li>
We do not believe that factoring and graph isomorphism will be resolved in the same period: 2032 <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\pm 10}" class="latex" /> years. That is, no polynomial algorithm will be found. At least, not found by anyone in the public domain. <p></p>
</li><li>
Quantum computers will be able to factor all numbers up to one million <em>purely</em> via Peter Shor’s algorithm by 2030. This may not seem impressive—and it isn’t—but compare what Wikipedia summarizes about the past decade <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization_records#Records_for_efforts_by_quantum_computers">here</a>. <p></p>
</li><li>
The Bitcoin protocol will be broken in at most five years. This will have a huge impact of course on the real markets. <p></p>
</li><li>
A super-linear lower bound on Boolean complexity will be found for some concrete problem.
</li></ul>
<p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We predict that we will be way off. Completely wrong. That sounds safe. What do you think?</p>
<p>
Ken adds that his impression from holiday shopping in Barnes and Noble is that the pandemic has been productive for books.  How much so for research?  When will we be able to say?</p></font></font></div>

<p>The chain rule is a fundamental result in calculus. Roughly speaking, it states that if a variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="c" class="latex" /> is a differentiable function of intermediate variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_1,\ldots,b_n" class="latex" />, and each intermediate variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_i" class="latex" /> is itself a differentiable function of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" />, then we can compute the derivative <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+c%7D%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+a%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\frac{{\mathrm d} c}{{\mathrm d} a}" class="latex" /> as follows:</p>

<p>Besides being a handy tool for computing derivatives in calculus homework, the chain rule is closely related to the backpropagation algorithm that is widely-used for computing derivatives (gradients) in neural network training. This <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2020/11/03/yet-another-backpropagation-tutorial/">blog post</a> by Boaz Barak is a beautiful tutorial on the chain rule and the backpropagation algorithm.</p>



<p>As in Barak’s post, the backpropagation algorithm is usually taught as an application of the chain rule in machine learning classes. This leads to a common belief that “backpropagation is just applying the chain rule repeatedly”. While this is in a sense true, we wish to point out in this blog post that this belief is over-simplifying and can lead to incorrect implementations of the backpropagation algorithm. It has been discussed in many <a href="https://timvieira.github.io/blog/post/2017/08/18/backprop-is-not-just-the-chain-rule/">blog</a> <a href="https://wordpress.cs.vt.edu/optml/2018/04/28/backpropagation-is-not-just-the-chain-rule/">posts</a> that backpropagation is not just the chain rule, but we want to focus on a simple and basic difference here.</p>

<p>Consider the “neural network” above: it consists of an input variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" />, an output variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="c" class="latex" />, and two intermediate variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_1" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_2" class="latex" />. The neural network describes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="c" class="latex" /> as a function of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" /> in the following way:</p>

<p>Using the chain rule <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-1">(1)</a> twice, we can compute the derivative <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+c%7D%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+a%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\frac{{\mathrm d} c}{{\mathrm d} a}" class="latex" /> as follows:</p>

<p>In the calculations above, note the difference between partial and full derivatives. For example, the partial derivative <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+b_2%7D%7B%5Cpartial+a%7D+%3D+3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\frac{\partial b_2}{\partial a} = 3" class="latex" />, whereas the full derivative <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+b_2%7D%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+a%7D+%3D+3%5Ctimes+1+%2B+1%5Ctimes+2+%3D+5&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\frac{{\mathrm d} b_2}{{\mathrm d} a} = 3\times 1 + 1\times 2 = 5" class="latex" />. Similarly, the partial derivative <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+c%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_1%7D+%3D+4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\frac{\partial c}{\partial b_1} = 4" class="latex" />, whereas the full derivative <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+c%7D%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+b_1%7D+%3D+5%5Ctimes+1+%2B+1%5Ctimes+4+%3D+9&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\frac{{\mathrm d} c}{{\mathrm d} b_1} = 5\times 1 + 1\times 4 = 9" class="latex" />. Intuitively, for every edge in the graph, we can compute the corresponding partial derivative locally (after the <em>forward pass</em>, to be precise), but a full derivative may require longer calculations.</p>



<p>Now it should be clear that equation <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-3">(3)</a> cannot be <em>directly</em> explained as the standard chain rule <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-1">(1)</a>. The key difference is that in the chain rule, we need partial derivatives of a single variable w.r.t. multiple other variables, whereas in <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-3">(3)</a>, we need partial derivatives of multiple variables w.r.t. the same variable.</p>



<p>Of course, one can prove the correctness of backpropagation using the chain rule in various ways, but the simple proof “backpropagation uses the standard chain rule at every step” is incomplete. Also, it is certainly possible to compute derivatives (gradients) on a neural network directly using the chain rule similarly to <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-2">(2)</a>, but in neural network training one typically wants to calculate the derivatives of a single output variable w.r.t. a large number of input variables, in which case backpropagation allows a more efficient implementation than using the standard chain rule directly.</p>



<h2 id="the-real-chain-rule-in-actual-backpropagation">The real chain rule in actual backpropagation</h2>



<p>When implementing the backpropagation algorithm, it is more convenient and efficient to add in the two terms (or any number of terms in general) on the right-hand-side of <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-3">(3)</a> at <em>different</em> steps of the algorithm. This is described in Barak’s <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2020/11/03/yet-another-backpropagation-tutorial/">tutorial</a>, which also has an actual Python implementation! In contrast to the failure of naively explaining equation <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-3">(3)</a> as the chain rule, there is a way to explain this implementation using the chain rule directly.</p>



<p>To describe the implementation, suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_1,\ldots,b_n" class="latex" /> are all the variables, including input variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_1,\ldots,b_m" class="latex" />, intermediate variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_%7Bm%2B1%7D%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_%7Bn-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_{m+1},\ldots,b_{n-1}" class="latex" />, and the only output variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3D+b_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="c = b_n" class="latex" />. Assume the variables are arranged in topological order: for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%3D+m%2B1%2C%5Cldots%2Cn&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="i = m+1,\ldots,n" class="latex" />, variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_i" class="latex" /> is locally a function of variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_j" class="latex" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j+%3C+i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="j &lt; i" class="latex" />. We can write this as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_i+%3D+b_i%28b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_%7Bi-1%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_i = b_i(b_1,\ldots,b_{i-1})" class="latex" />. Note that some variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_j" class="latex" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j+%3C+i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="j &lt; i" class="latex" /> may not have an edge to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_i" class="latex" />, in which case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+b_i%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D+%3D+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\frac{\partial b_i}{\partial b_j} = 0" class="latex" />.</p>



<p>For each variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_i" class="latex" />, backpropagation stores in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf {grad}}_i" class="latex" /> a “temporary derivative/gradient” w.r.t. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_i" class="latex" />. Initially, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_n+%3D+1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf {grad}}_n = 1" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_i+%3D+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf {grad}}_i = 0" class="latex" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%3C+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="i &lt; n" class="latex" />. The backpropagation algorithm iterates over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%3D+n%2Cn-1%2C%5Cldots%2Cm%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="i = n,n-1,\ldots,m+1" class="latex" /> and performs the following updates in each iteration:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center" id="eq-4"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_j+%5Cgets+%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_j+%2B+%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_i+%5Ccdot+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+b_i%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D+%2C%5C+%5Ctextnormal%7Bfor+all%7D%5C+j+%3D+1%2C%5Cldots%2Ci-1.+%26%26+%284%29+%5Cend%7Baligned%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\begin{aligned}{\mathsf {grad}}_j \gets {\mathsf {grad}}_j + {\mathsf {grad}}_i \cdot \frac{\partial b_i}{\partial b_j} ,\ \textnormal{for all}\ j = 1,\ldots,i-1. &amp;&amp; (4) \end{aligned}" class="latex" /></p>



<p>Of course, it suffices to update <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf {grad}}_j" class="latex" /> only when there is an edge from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_j" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_i" class="latex" />, because otherwise <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+b_i%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D+%3D+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\frac{\partial b_i}{\partial b_j} = 0" class="latex" /> and the update does not change <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf {grad}}_j" class="latex" />.</p>



<p>The update rule <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-4">(4)</a> can be explained as a direct application of the chain rule as follows. If we know the values of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_1,\ldots,b_i" class="latex" />, we can evaluate the remaining variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_%7Bi%2B1%7D%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_{i+1},\ldots,b_n" class="latex" /> one by one, so in this sense, the output variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3D+b_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="c = b_n" class="latex" /> is a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="c_i" class="latex" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_1,\ldots,b_i" class="latex" />. Using the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_i+%3D+b_i%28b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_%7Bi-1%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_i = b_i(b_1,\ldots,b_{i-1})" class="latex" />, we can relate functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="c_i" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_%7Bi-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="c_{i-1}" class="latex" /> as follows:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7Dc_%7Bi-1%7D%28b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_%7Bi-1%7D%29+%3D+c_i%28b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_%7Bi-1%7D%2C+b_i%28b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_%7Bi-1%7D%29%29.%5Cend%7Baligned%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\begin{aligned}c_{i-1}(b_1,\ldots,b_{i-1}) = c_i(b_1,\ldots,b_{i-1}, b_i(b_1,\ldots,b_{i-1})).\end{aligned}" class="latex" /></p>



<p>By the chain rule,</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center" id="eq-5"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+c_%7Bi-1%7D%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+c_i%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+c_i%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_i%7D+%5Ccdot+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+b_i%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D%2C%5C+%5Ctext%7Bfor+all%7D%5C+j+%3D+1%2C%5Cldots%2C+i-1.+%26%26+%285%29+%5Cend%7Baligned%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\begin{aligned}\frac{\partial c_{i-1}}{\partial b_j} = \frac{\partial c_i}{\partial b_j} + \frac{\partial c_i}{\partial b_i} \cdot \frac{\partial b_i}{\partial b_j},\ \text{for all}\ j = 1,\ldots, i-1. &amp;&amp; (5) \end{aligned}" class="latex" /></p>



<p>The correspondence between <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-4">(4)</a> and <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-5">(5)</a> completes the explanation: if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_j+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+c_i%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf {grad}}_j = \frac{\partial c_i}{\partial b_j}" class="latex" /> for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j+%5Cle+i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="j \le i" class="latex" /> before the update, we have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_j+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+c_%7Bi-1%7D%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf {grad}}_j = \frac{\partial c_{i-1}}{\partial b_j}" class="latex" /> for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j+%3C+i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="j &lt; i" class="latex" /> after the update.

<p>A few hours ago <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/combinatorial_theory">the first issue of <em>Combinatorial Theory</em></a> was published. I am happy and proud to take part in this new endeavor. The editorial speaks for itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This is the first issue of our new journal, </em>Combinatorial Theory<em>. It is owned by mathematicians, dedicated to Diamond Open Access publishing with no fees for authors or readers, and committed to an inclusive view of the vibrant worldwide community in Combinatorics. The journal shares a similar scope with the long-running </em>Journal of Combinatorial Theory Ser. A<em>(JCT A), owned by Elsevier. In 2020, almost all of the editors of JCT A resigned, deciding that it was the time to found a premier Combinatorics journal owned by mathematicians, not by a commercial publisher. Thus was born </em>Combinatorial Theory<em>. That birth has allowed us to rethink how and what we publish. We are proud to have assembled a broad and diverse team of editors. We are also pleased with two new features in our editorial process: </em>doubly-anonymous refereeing<em> to mitigate implicit biases during peer review, and the inauguration of </em>Expository Article<em> submissions to encourage inclusion of valuable well-written expositions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also have warm feelings toward <em>Journal of Combinatorial Theory Ser. A</em> and the earlier <em>Journal of Combinatorial Theory</em> (before it split to Ser A and Ser B), which was among the first journals of combinatorics, had important role for the development of our field, and which is still running under new editors.</p>

<p>If you are interested in graph colouring, and specifically in distributed algorithms for that classic problem, I strongly recommend the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00604" target="_blank">recent paper</a> posted by Magnús M. Halldórsson, Fabian Kuhn, Alexandre Nolin and Tigran Tonoyan. (For the record, three of the authors work, or have worked, in my department at Reykjavik University, so I am biased.) </p><p>The above-mentioned paper addresses the problem of finding a proper colouring of a graph when each node <i>v</i> has a palette of degree(<i>v</i>)+1 colours at its disposal. The paper resolves an open problem in distributed colouring and simplifies known results in doing so. As a byproduct of their results, the authors obtain improved streaming and sub-linear time algorithms.   See the paper for much more information on the context for this result and the technical details. </p><p>Congratulations to the authors!</p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en">
<p>I’m on the ICALP 2022 program committee (PC) and was apparently the first to complain when I saw the draft call for papers, and I asked that the requirement that <a href="https://icalp2022.irif.fr/?page_id=17">submissions must be in LIPIcs style</a> be put to a vote.  Despite substantial support among the PC for not requiring the majority of authors to squander their time formatting in an exotic style submissions that will be rejected, the Supreme Court blocked the vote.  Their main rationale seems to be ensuring correspondence between submissions and proceedings.  Ironically, at the same time other conferences are allowing authors to publish in proceedings an <em>abridged </em>version of the (accepted) submission, to make it easier to publish the paper in a journal (which may not want to have a full version already in a conference).  We are at the nadir in history where human effort is systematically wasted to produce versions that do not even pretend to be useful for readers — only to check boxes.</p>



<p>When I was at the IAS and was briefed about logistics, I was stunned when they asked me if I type my own papers, or if I needed help with that.  I guess the next level will be if you need help with formatting your submissions.</p>



<p>Picture a 100-year old retired scientist who followed the field for 75 years, and who wants to make one more contribution.  Even though they are no match for the raw power of a 15-year old, their ability to draw connections almost makes up for it, and their perspective is invaluable to the community.  This scientist, whose equipment consists of a desktop from two human generations ago, miraculously held together and kept working through sheer love and intimate knowledge, is now being asked to format their paper in LIPIcs style… or to ask someone else to do it for them (talk about fostering collaboration).</p>



<p>Here’s a non-exclusive list of true, terrible things about conferences, most of which were discussed earlier on this blog (see tag <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/tag/utopia-tcs/">utopia-tcs</a>):</p>



<ol><li>Requiring submissions in proceedings format.</li><li>Pre-registering papers by a deadline different than the submission deadline.</li><li>Requiring authors to submit a separate 2-page summary of the paper.</li><li>Ultra-strict page limits, summary rejection for any deviation.</li><li>Suddenly being forced on a short notice to submit a dummy .pdf so that PC assignments can be made.</li><li>Extending the list of topics two days before the deadline.</li><li>Moving deadlines.</li><li>Forcing authors to check multiple times the call for papers and/or constantly monitor email for any of these last-minute changes.</li><li>In the lucky case of acceptance, following up with a barrage of emails involving minutiae such as underfull \hbox.</li><li>Writing “this only takes 60 seconds.”  For me (and, apparently, many others — otherwise why delay answering emails that take 10 seconds to answer?) attending to <em>any</em> task, following <em>any</em> instruction, even “blink” or “say yes” has a huge fix cost, maybe 30 minutes.  So I translate 60 seconds to 31 minutes.</li><li>Hosting the conference in places which are inconvenient, for the attendees and planet earth.</li><li>Hosting the conference at times which are inconvenient for the attendees.</li><li>Requiring in-person PC meetings whose outcome does not justify the costs.</li></ol>



<p>As usual, people in a position of power do not have much incentive to fight to change the very practices that put them in that position in the first place.  But even this cynical remark doesn’t tell the whole story, since the practices got <em>worse</em> with time, unlike the case of journals.  One impression I have is that people have gotten so used to buggy software, constant updates, and general techno slavery that they just accept all of this as another inevitable misery in life… and by far not the worst!  This last point is important, as I think a seeping philosophy that permeates much of the discussion and the decisions is that much more important things are at stake, so who cares about this?  If you really want to spend cycles fixing something, then what about X?  (It’s fun to think where you end up if you stretch this point.)  But another life is possible.</p>



<p>One day, I will throw in my two cents and launch a new journal.  Besides being electronic and free (like ToC) it will have the following features.</p>



<ol><li>Papers, if accepted, will appear in the authors’ chosen format.  No conversion, and no additional effort, will be required for publication.  All the effort will be exclusively directed at improving the content of the paper.</li><li>Submissions can be by pdf attachment or by overlay, but not only to arxiv: to *any* repository.  In particular, authors will not be required to get their paper to compile on the arxiv.</li><li>The identities of the reviewers will be made public (in case of acceptance).  This I am still debating, but so far I am leaning towards it.  The problem that this is trying to address is that while you get reputation points for being on a program committee or on an editorial board, you don’t get many for being an unknown journal referee who is actually supposedly doing the hard work or finally really checking the proofs.  Instead with public identities people can show off the hard work and their role in the community, as happens on more recent platforms like say stackexchange.</li><li>Authors will be free to submit anonymously, or not.  This choice will be made by the authors, not dictated by a committee.</li><li>And perhaps the most consequential thing that I am still debating, should all submissions be public? (Maybe not.)</li></ol>



<p></p>



<p>To finish on a high note, a great thing about conferences is the fast turn-around.  It is really depressing — in other fields — to have to wait so long for any quantifiable feedback on your work, and this is definitely something which I liked about the TCS community.  But, to come back to the mood of the post, this good aspect (and others) of conferences can probably be kept while rethinking the not so good.  (For example, there could be a journal with deadlines similar to conferences, which is also what happens for grant proposals etc.)</p>

<div class="content">
This paper aims to derandomize the following problems in the smoothed analysis of Spielman and Teng. Learn Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), invert Fourier Transforms (FT), and verify small circuits' unsatisfiability. Learning algorithms must predict a future observation from the only $m$ i.i.d. samples of a fixed but unknown joint-distribution $P(G(x),y)$ to explain an $\eta$-noisy target. Inverters must retrieve the hidden parameter $\theta$. The smoothed analysis can weaken the adversarial distribution $P(x,y)$ by injecting an appropriate perturbation $G$ with larger min-entropy $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G)$.  We will establish 1--10 for planted functions (Goldreich's PRG) $f_\theta(x) = f(\theta \circ x_1,\ldots,\theta \circ x_d)$ with variables $x_i \in \{0,1,\ldots,2n-1\}$ plugged into $\theta\circ x_i := \theta(\lfloor{x_i/2}\rfloor)\oplus x_i$ in 1--4, $\theta\circ x_i := \theta_i \cdot \lfloor{x_i/2}\rfloor \cdot (-1)^{x_i}\in \mathbb{Z}_p$ in 5--6, and $\theta\circ x_i := \theta(\lfloor{x_i/2}\rfloor) \cdot (-1)^{x_i} \in \mathbb{Z}_p$ in 7. 8--10 will verify the unsatisfiability of small circuits in the worst case analysis (i.e., $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = 0$). Suppose $\log n \gg \log (ds/\varepsilon) + k$ in 1--4. Randomly pick an example $(X,Y)$ from the observed $m$ data in 4.

1. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = 0$, $\mathrm{Max}k\mathrm{CSP}$ of any $k$-variate predicate $f$ requires the sample size $\Omega(n^{(k-\epsilon)/2}) \le m \le \tilde{O}(n^{k/2})$ to distinguish between $|\max_\theta P(y=f_\theta(x)) - \max_\theta P'(y=f_\theta(x))| \ge \Omega(1)$ and $P(x,y) \equiv P'(x,y)$ in $n^{O(k)}$ time by given access to both samplers $P(x,y)$ and $P'(x,y)$.
2. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = c\log s$, the planted $s$-term DNF demands $m \ge n^{\Omega(\log s)}$ for $c$ less than 1, and $m \le n^{1/2 \log s + O(1)}$ for $c$ greater than 1, to make $n^{O(\log s)}$-time PAC learning (even under a slight noise).
3. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = c\log 1/\varepsilon$, the $\mathrm{planted}$ $\mathrm{AND}$ needs $m \ge n^{\Omega(\log 1/\varepsilon)}$ for $c$ less than $1$, and $m \le n^{1/2 \log(1/\varepsilon) + O(1)}$ for $c$ greater than $1$, to make $(\eta+\varepsilon)$-accurate agnostic learning in $n^{O(\log 1/\varepsilon)}$-time.
4. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = O(\log s)$, the $\mathrm{monotone}$ $\mathrm{DNF}$ with expanding $s$-terms is PAC learnable from $m = n\cdot \mathrm{poly}(s)$ data with $\mathrm{Pr}[\lfloor{{X_{i}/2}}\rfloor, \lfloor{{X_{i'}/2}}\rfloor] \ge {1}/{n^{1+\epsilon}}$  in $n \cdot \tilde{O}(s^{\log d})$ time.
5. LPN and LWE over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of $p\ge n^{\Omega(1)}$ hiding small secrets $\forall i, |\theta_i| = O(1)$ are breakable in polynomial time. 
6. GapSVP$_{\tilde{O}(n^2)}$ is breakable within polynomial time.
7. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = O(n)$, any $2^{n/2}$ by $2^{n/2}$ matrix with sparsity $2^{n-n^{\epsilon}}$ demands $\exp(n^{\Omega(1)})$ size $\mathrm{PH^{cc}}$ protocol unless it is learnable from $m = \exp(n^{\epsilon})$ data in $\exp(n^{\epsilon})$ time.
8. $\mathrm{VP} \ne \mathrm{VNP}$ or $\forall k, \mathrm{quasi}$-$NP \not\subset \mathrm{NC}^k$.
9. $\mathrm{PIT} \in \mathrm{DTIME}[n^{\mathrm{poly}(\log \log n)}]$ or $\forall \epsilon, \forall k, \mathrm{NTIME}[2^{n^{\epsilon}}] \not\subset \mathrm{SIZE}[n^k]$.
10. $\mathrm{quasi}$-$\mathrm{NP} \not\subset \mathrm{TC}^0$.</div>
