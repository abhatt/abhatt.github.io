given a $t$-uniform hypergraph $H=(V,E)$, the goal is to find the smallest
collection of $(t-1)$-element subsets of $V$ such that every hyperedge $e \in
E$ contains one of these subsets. In addition to its inherent combinatorial
interest---for instance, the $t=3$ case is connected to Tuza's famous
conjecture on covering triangles of a graph with edges---variants of AHTP arise
in recently proposed reductions to fundamental Euclidean clustering problems.
</p>
<p>AHTP admits a trivial factor $t$ approximation algorithm as it can be cast as
an instance of vertex cover on a structured $t$-uniform hypergraph that is a
``blown-up'' version of $H$. Our main result is an approximation algorithm with
ratio $\frac{t}{2}+o(t)$. The algorithm is based on rounding the natural LP
relaxation using a careful combination of thresholding and color coding.
</p>
<p>We also present results motivated by structural aspects of the blown-up
hypergraph. The blown-up is a $\textit{simple}$ hypergraph with hyperedges
intersecting in at most one element. We prove that vertex cover on simple
$t$-uniform hypergraphs is as hard to approximate as general $t$-uniform
hypergraphs. The blown-up hypergraph further has many forbidden structures,
including a ``tent'' structure for the case $t=3$. Whether a generalization of
Tuza's conjecture could also hold for tent-free $3$-uniform hypergraphs was
posed in a recent work. We answer this question in the negative by giving a
construction based on combinatorial lines that is tent-free, and yet needs to
include most of the vertices in a vertex cover.

<p>Typical applications of the $k$-Center problem can be found in logistics or
urban planning and hence, it is natural to study the problem on transportation
networks. Such networks are often characterized as graphs that are (almost)
planar or have low doubling dimension, highway dimension or skeleton dimension.
It was shown by Feldmann and Marx that $k$-Center is W[1]-hard on planar graphs
of constant doubling dimension when parameterized by the number of centers $k$,
the highway dimension $hd$ and the pathwidth $pw$. We extend their result and
show that even if we additionally parameterize by the skeleton dimension
$\kappa$, the $k$-Center problem remains W[1]-hard. Moreover, we prove that
under the Exponential Time Hypothesis there is no exact algorithm for
$k$-Center that has runtime $f(k,hd,pw,\kappa) \cdot \vert V \vert^{o(pw +
\kappa + \sqrt{k+hd})}$ for any computable function $f$.

getting faster and faster, and the amount of data that various applications
need to process becomes extremely huge. Therefore, we need to put more effort
into analyzing data and extracting valuable information. Cloud computing used
to be a good technology to solve a large number of data analysis problems.
However, in the era of the popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT),
transmitting sensing data back to the cloud for centralized data analysis will
consume a lot of wireless communication and network transmission costs. To
solve the above problems, edge computing has become a promising solution. In
this paper, we propose a new algorithm for processing probabilistic skyline
queries over uncertain data streams in an edge computing environment. We use
the concept of a second skyline set to filter data that is unlikely to be the
result of the skyline. Besides, the edge server only sends the information
needed to update the global analysis results on the cloud server, which will
greatly reduce the amount of data transmitted over the network. The results
show that our proposed method not only reduces the response time by more than
50% compared with the brute force method on two-dimensional data but also
maintains the leading processing speed on high-dimensional data.

Recently, an optimal algorithm for selection on $X+Y$, based on soft heaps, was
introduced. By combining this approach with layer-ordered heaps (LOHs), an
algorithm using a balanced binary tree of $X+Y$ selections was proposed to
perform $k$-selection on $X_1+X_2+\cdots+X_m$ in $o(n\cdot m + k\cdot m)$,
where $X_i$ have length $n$. Here, that $o(n\cdot m + k\cdot m)$ algorithm is
combined with a novel, optimal LOH-based algorithm for selection on $X+Y$
(without a soft heap). Performance of algorithms for selection on
$X_1+X_2+\cdots+X_m$ are compared empirically, demonstrating the benefit of the
algorithm proposed here.

making $q$ quantum queries, can also be computed classically with an advantage
$\delta/2$ by a randomized decision tree making
${O}_q(N^{1-\frac{1}{2q}}\delta^{-2})$ queries. Moreover, they conjectured the
$k$-Forrelation problem -- a partial function that can be computed with $q =
\lceil k/2 \rceil$ quantum queries -- to be a suitable candidate for exhibiting
such an extremal separation. We prove their conjecture by showing a tight lower
bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}_k(N^{1-1/k})$ for the randomized query complexity
of $k$-Forrelation, where the advantage $\delta = 1/\mathrm{polylog}^k(N)$ and
$\widetilde{\Omega}_k$ hides $\mathrm{polylog}^k(N)$ factors. Our proof relies
on classical Gaussian tools, in particular, Gaussian interpolation and Gaussian
integration by parts, and in fact, shows a more general statement, that to
prove lower bounds for $k$-Forrelation against a family of functions, it
suffices to bound the $\ell_1$-weight of the Fourier coefficients at levels $k,
2k, 3k, \ldots, (k-1)k$ for functions in the family.

detection and image segmentation due to its global optimality and
well-established numerical solutions such as fast marching algorithm. In this
paper, we introduce a flexible interactive image segmentation model based on
the minimal geodesic framework in conjunction with region-based homogeneity
enhancement. A key ingredient in our model is the construction of Finsler
geodesic metrics, which are capable of integrating anisotropic and asymmetric
edge features, region-based homogeneity and/or curvature regularization. This
is done by exploiting an implicit method to incorporate the region-based
homogeneity information to the metrics used. Moreover, we also introduce a way
to build objective simple closed contours, each of which is treated as the
concatenation of two disjoint open paths. Experimental results prove that the
proposed model indeed outperforms state-of-the-art minimal paths-based image
segmentation approaches.

(respectively, odd) length that is at least four. Bienstock [DM 1991 and 1992]
proved that detecting an even (respectively, odd) hole containing a given
vertex is NP-complete. Conforti, Chornu\'ejols, Kappor, and Vu\v{s}kovi\'{c}
[FOCS 1997] gave the first known polynomial-time algorithm to determine whether
a graph contains even holes. Chudnovsky, Kawarabayashi, and Seymour [JGT 2005]
estimated that Conforti et al.'s algorithm runs in $O(n^{40})$ time on an
$n$-vertex graph and reduced the required time to $O(n^{31})$. Subsequently,
da~Silva and Vu\v{s}kovi\'{c}~[JCTB 2013], Chang and Lu [JCTB 2017], and Lai,
Lu, and Thorup [STOC 2020] improved the time to $O(n^{19})$, $O(n^{11})$, and
$O(n^9)$, respectively. The tractability of determining whether a graph
contains odd holes has been open for decades until the algorithm of Chudnovsky,
Scott, Seymour, and Spirkl [JACM 2020] that runs in $O(n^9)$ time, which Lai et
al. also reduced to $O(n^8)$. By extending Chudnovsky et al.'s techniques for
detecting odd holes, Chudnovsky, Scott, and Seymour [Combinatorica 2020 to
appear] (respectively, [arXiv 2020]) ensured the tractability of finding a long
(respectively, shortest) odd hole. They also ensured the NP-hardness of finding
a longest odd hole, whose reduction also works for finding a longest even hole.
Recently, Cook and Seymour ensured the tractability of finding a long even
hole. An intriguing missing piece is the tractability of finding a shortest
even hole, left open for at least 15 years by, e.g., Chudnovsky et al. [JGT
2005] and Johnson [TALG 2005]. We resolve this long-standing open problem by
giving the first known polynomial-time algorithm, running in $O(n^{31})$ time,
for finding a shortest even hole in an $n$-vertex graph that contains even
holes.

simpler and easy-to-visualize representations of the data that preserve its
essential properties. A widely-used method to preserve the underlying
hierarchical structure of the data while reducing its complexity is to find an
embedding of the data into a tree or an ultrametric. The most popular
algorithms for this task are the classic linkage algorithms (single, average,
or complete). However, these methods on a data set of $n$ points in
$\Omega(\log n)$ dimensions exhibit a quite prohibitive running time of
$\Theta(n^2)$.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we provide a new algorithm which takes as input a set of
points $P$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and for every $c\ge 1$, runs in time
$n^{1+\frac{\rho}{c^2}}$ (for some universal constant $\rho&gt;1$) to output an
ultrametric $\Delta$ such that for any two points $u,v$ in $P$, we have
$\Delta(u,v)$ is within a multiplicative factor of $5c$ to the distance between
$u$ and $v$ in the "best" ultrametric representation of $P$. Here, the best
ultrametric is the ultrametric $\tilde\Delta$ that minimizes the maximum
distance distortion with respect to the $\ell_2$ distance, namely that
minimizes $\underset{u,v \in P}{\max}\ \frac{\tilde\Delta(u,v)}{\|u-v\|_2}$.
</p>
<p>We complement the above result by showing that under popular complexity
theoretic assumptions, for every constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, no algorithm with
running time $n^{2-\varepsilon}$ can distinguish between inputs in
$\ell_\infty$-metric that admit isometric embedding and those that incur a
distortion of $\frac{3}{2}$.
</p>
<p>Finally, we present empirical evaluation on classic machine learning datasets
and show that the output of our algorithm is comparable to the output of the
linkage algorithms while achieving a much faster running time.

developing an average-case analogue of Fine-Grained Complexity (FGC).
</p>
<p>This paper defines new versions of OV, $k$SUM and zero-$k$-clique that are
both worst-case and average-case fine-grained hard assuming the core hypotheses
of FGC. We then use these as a basis for fine-grained hardness and average-case
hardness of other problems. The new problems represent their inputs in a
certain ``factored'' form. We call them ``factored''-OV,
``factored''-zero-$k$-clique and ``factored''-$3$SUM. We show that
factored-$k$-OV and factored $k$SUM are equivalent and are complete for a class
of problems defined over Boolean functions. Factored zero-$k$-clique is also
complete, for a different class of problems.
</p>
<p>Our hard factored problems are also simple enough that we can reduce them to
many other problems, e.g.~to edit distance, $k$-LCS and versions of Max-Flow.
We further consider counting variants of the factored problems and give
WCtoACFG reductions for them for a natural distribution. Through FGC reductions
we then get average-case hardness for well-studied problems like regular
expression matching from standard worst-case FGC assumptions.
</p>
<p>To obtain our WCtoACFG reductions, we formalize the framework of [Boix-Adsera
et al. 2019] that was used to give a WCtoACFG reduction for counting
$k$-cliques. We define an explicit property of problems such that if a problem

(randomized) massively parallel computation (MPC) model by comparing it with
the (sequential) RAM model. As our main result, we show the existence of hard
functions that are essentially not parallelizable in the MPC model. Based on
the widely-used random oracle methodology in cryptography with a cryptographic
hash function $h:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$ computable in time $t_h$, we
show that there exists a function that can be computed in time $O(T\cdot t_h)$
and space $S$ by a RAM algorithm, but any MPC algorithm with local memory size
$s &lt; S/c$ for some $c&gt;1$ requires at least $\tilde{\Omega}(T)$ rounds to
compute the function, even in the average case, for a wide range of parameters
$n \leq S \leq T \leq 2^{n^{1/4}}$. Our result is almost optimal in the sense
that by taking $T$ to be much larger than $t_h$, \textit{e.g.}, $T$ to be
sub-exponential in $t_h$, to compute the function, the round complexity of any
MPC algorithm with small local memory size is asymptotically the same (up to a
polylogarithmic factor) as the time complexity of the RAM algorithm. Our result
is obtained by adapting the so-called compression argument from the data
structure lower bounds and cryptography literature to the context of massively
parallel computation.

In this paper we develop efficient randomized algorithms to solve the black-box reconstruction problem for polynomials(over finite fields) computable by depth three arithmetic circuits with alternating addition/multiplication gates, such that top(output) gate is an addition gate with in-degree $2$. Such circuits naturally compute polynomials of the form $G\times(T_1 + T_2)$, where $G,T_1,T_2$ are product of affine forms computed at the first(addition) layer in the circuit, and polynomials $T_1,T_2$ have no common factors. Rank of such a circuit is defined to be the dimension of vector space spanned by all affine factors of $T_1$ and $T_2$. For any polynomial $f$ computable by such a circuit, $rank(f)$ is defined to be the minimum rank of any such circuit computing it. Our work develops randomized algorithms, which take as input a black-box computing polynomial $f$, with coefficients in a finite field $\mathbb{F}$, exhibiting such a circuit. Here are the results. 

$[$Low rank$]:$ When $5\leq r = rank(f) = O(\log^3 d)$, it runs in time $(nd^{\log^3d}\log |\mathbb{F}|)^{O(1)}$ and outputs a depth three circuit computing $f$ (with high probability), with top addition gate having in-degree $\leq d^{rank(f)}$.

$[$High rank$]:$ When $rank(f) = \Omega(\log^3 d)$, it runs in time $(nd\log |\mathbb{F}|)^{O(1)}$, and with high probability outputs a depth three circuit computing $f$, with top addition gate having in-degree $2$.

Prior to our work, black-box reconstruction for this circuit class was addressed in [Shp07, KS09, Sin16b]. Reconstruction algorithm in [Shp07] runs in time quasi-polynomial in $n,d,|\mathbb{F}|$ and that in [KS09] is quasi-polynomial in $d,|\mathbb{F}|$. Algorithm in [Sin16b] works only for polynomials over characteristic zero fields. Thus ours is the first blackbox reconstruction algorithm for this class of circuits that runs in time polynomial in $\log |\mathbb{F}|$. This problem has been mentioned as an open problem in [GKL12] (STOC 2012). In the high rank case, our algorithm runs in $(nd\log|\mathbb{F}|)^{O(1)}$ time, thereby significantly improving the existing algorithms in [Shp07, KS09].</div>

We give a strong direct sum theorem for computing $XOR \circ g$.  Specifically, we show that the randomized query complexity of computing the XOR of $k$ instances of $g$ satisfies $\bar{R}_\varepsilon(XOR \circ g)=\Theta(\bar{R}_{\varepsilon/k}(g))$.  This matches the naive success amplification bound and answers a question of Blais and Brody.

As a consequence of our strong direct sum theorem, we give a total function $g$ for which $R(XOR \circ g) = \Theta(k\log(k)R(g))$, answering an open question from Ben-David et al.</div>

A Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n\to \{0,1\}$ is $k$-linear if it returns the sum (over the binary field $F_2$) of $k$ coordinates of the input. In this paper, we study property testing of the classes $k$-Linear, the class of all $k$-linear functions, and $k$-Linear$^*$, the class $\cup_{j=0}^kj$-Linear.
We give a non-adaptive distribution-free two-sided $\epsilon$-tester for $k$-Linear that makes
$$O\left(k\log k+\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$$ queries.
This matches the lower bound known from the literature.

We then give a non-adaptive distribution-free one-sided $\epsilon$-tester for $k$-Linear$^*$ that makes the same number of queries and show that any non-adaptive uniform-distribution one-sided $\epsilon$-tester for $k$-Linear must make at least $ \tilde\Omega(k)\log n+\Omega(1/\epsilon)$ queries. The latter bound, almost matches the upper bound $O(k\log n+1/\epsilon)$ known from the literature. We then show that any adaptive uniform-distribution one-sided $\epsilon$-tester for $k$-Linear must make at least $\tilde\Omega(\sqrt{k})\log n+\Omega(1/\epsilon)$ queries.</div>

In my poll of P vs NP and other issues, one of the questions was<br />
<br />
<br />
                             <i>Is factoring in P?</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
One of the most interesting answers was<br />
<br />
<br />
                            <i> I don't really see why it shouldn't be. - Peter Shor</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
Recall that Peter Shor proved Factoring is in Quantum-P which lead to intense interest in Quantum Computing.<br />
<br />
1) What if factoring was in P and this was shown before Shor's algorithm? Would Shor or someone else have ever proven factoring in quantum P? Would there be as much intense interest in quantum computing as there is now? Perhaps by physicists more than CS people?<br />
<br />
2) What if factoring was in P and this was shown before RSA? Where would crypto be now? Zip drives with a googleplex random (or nearly random) bits and more 1-time pads? More lattice based crypto? Or RSA but with larger numbers? This may depend on how good the factoring algorithm is.<br />
<br />
3) More generally, how much does the order of events matter for science?<br />
<br />
a) If the Banach-Tarski paradox was discovered early on, would we have just tossed out the Axiom of Choice before so much more was build on it? Darling thinks we should toss out AC NOW because of Banach-Tarski.<br />
<br />
b) In the model of set theory L you can do ALL of math except some parts of set theory and maybe a few other things (note quite: Harvey Friedman has found some combinatorial statements that need large cardinals to prove). Had L been discovered earlier then could we all now be working in L (except a few people who look at other models, but they are not in the mainstream)? We might know more about L and less about forcing. We would KNOW that AC and CH are true. Or we would think we know.<br />
<br />
c) If  Engineers were the first ones to look at SAT and reductions, might they have been content to know that  if SAT \le A then A is probably hard? No need for the Cook-Levin Theorem! And then when someone proved Cook-Levin would the Engineers not really cares since they already knew SAT was hard?<br />
<br />d) I can imagine Ramsey's Theorem being discovered much later for some application, or perhaps never being discovered at all.<div><br /></div><div>e) VDW's theorem has so few application, I can imagine it never being discovered. </div><div><br /></div><div>4) There are cases where if A was discovered before B then B has an easy proof, whereas if B was discovered before A, then B has a hard proof. I'll give one example:</div><div><br /></div><div>Given HALT is undecidable, Godel's theorem is easy.</div><div><br /></div><div>Assume HALT is undecidable. </div><div><br /></div><div>Let STAT(e) be the statement M_e(0) does not  halt.</div><div><br /></div><div>There is some e such that M_e(0) does not halt  but ZFC cannot prove this.</div><div><br /></div><div>PROOF: Assume, By Way of Contradiction that for all e such that M_e(0) does not halt,</div><div>ZFC could prove this. Then HALT is DECIDABLE:</div><div><br />Given e, run M_e(0) and at the same time enumerate all proofs in ZFC. It is guaranteed that</div><div>you will either find M_e(0) halts or a proof that M_e(0) does not halt. Hence you will,</div><div>in finite time, know if M_e(0) halts OR NOT.</div><div><br /></div><div>END OF PROOF</div><div><br /></div><div>Is the sequence of events where HALT is proven undecidable  before Godel's theorem plausible.</div><div>I  think so</div><div><br /></div><div>I INVITE my readers to give there own examples of when Math is not commutative- meaning that</div><div>the order of events matters.</div><div>

considerably reduces the gap between stretchable and non-stretchable instances.

service to clarify how to build cost-effective hybrid storage systems. A hybrid
storage system consists of fast but low-capacity tier (first tier) and slow but
high-capacity tier (second tier). And, it typically consists of either SSDs and
HDDs or NVMs and SSDs. As a result, we found that 1) regions for first tier
should be assigned only if a workload includes large number of IO accesses for
a whole day, 2) the regions that include a large number of IO accesses should
be dynamically chosen and moved from second tier to first tier for a short
interval, and 3) if a cache hit ratio is regularly low, use of the cache for
the workload should be cancelled, and the whole workload region should be
assigned to the region for first tier. These workloads already have been
released from the SNIA web site.

For each type of point, and as a function of the degree of the polynomial, we
study the complexity of deciding (1) if a given point is of that type, and (2)
if a polynomial has a point of that type. Our results characterize the
complexity of these two questions for all degrees left open by prior
literature. Our main contributions reveal that many of these questions turn out
to be tractable for cubic polynomials. In particular, we present an
efficiently-checkable necessary and sufficient condition for local minimality
of a point for a cubic polynomial. We also show that a local minimum of a cubic
polynomial can be efficiently found by solving semidefinite programs of size
linear in the number of variables. By contrast, we show that it is strongly
NP-hard to decide if a cubic polynomial has a critical point. We also prove
that the set of second-order points of any cubic polynomial is a spectrahedron,
and conversely that any spectrahedron is the projection of the set of
second-order points of a cubic polynomial. In our final section, we briefly
present a potential application of finding local minima of cubic polynomials to
the design of a third-order Newton method.

We give two results on the size of AC0 circuits computing promise majority. $\epsilon$-promise majority is majority promised that either at most an $\epsilon$ fraction of the input bits are 1, or at most $\epsilon$ are 0.

First, we show super quadratic lower bounds on both monotone and general depth 3 circuits for promise majority.

For any $\epsilon \in (0, 1/2)$, monotone depth 3 AC0 circuits for $\epsilon$-promise majority have size 
$\tilde{\Omega}\left(\epsilon^3 n^{2 + \frac{\ln(1 - \epsilon)}{\ln(\epsilon)}}\right)$
         
For any $\epsilon \in (0, 1/2)$, general depth 3 AC0 circuits for $\epsilon$-promise majority have size
$\tilde{\Omega}\left(\epsilon^3 n^{2 + \frac{\ln(1 - \epsilon^2)}{2\ln(\epsilon)}}\right)$

These are the first nontrivial size lower bounds on depth 3 promise majority circuits for $\epsilon &lt; 0.45$.
        
Second, we give both uniform and non-uniform sub-quadratic size constant depth circuits for promise majority.

For integer $k \geq 1$, constant $\epsilon \in (0, 1/2)$, there exists monotone non uniform AC0 circuits of depth $2 + 2 \cdot k$ computing $\epsilon$-promise majority with size
$\tilde{O}\left(n^{\frac{1}{1 - 2^{-k}}}\right)$

For integer $k \geq 1$, constant $\epsilon \in (0, 1/2)$, there exists monotone uniform AC0 circuit of depth $2 + 2 \cdot k$ computing $\epsilon$-promise majority with size
$n^{\frac{1}{1 - \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^k} + o(1)}$

These circuits are based on incremental improvements to existing depth 3 circuits for promise majority given by Ajtai and Viola combined with a divide and conquer strategy.</div>

<div class="content">
In recent work by Chattopadhyay et al.[CHHL19,CHLT19], the authors exhibit a simple and flexible construction of pseudorandom generators for classes of Boolean functions that satisfy $L_1$ Fourier bounds. [CHHL19] show that if a class satisfies such tail bounds at all levels, this implies a PRG whose seed length depends on the quality of these bounds through their innovative random walk framework that composes together fractional PRGs that polarize quickly to the Boolean hypercube. On the other hand, [CHLT19] show that, by derandomizing the analysis of [RT19], just level-two Fourier bounds suffice to construct a pseudorandom generator using their framework; as this is a much weaker assumption on the class, [CHLT19] naturally obtain exponentially worse dependence on the error in the seed length compared to [CHHL19]. Moreover, this derandomization relies on simulating nearly independent Gaussians for the fractional pseudorandom generator, which necessitates the  polynomial dependence on $1/\epsilon$ in each fractional step.
    
    In this work, we attempt to bridge the gap between these two results. Namely, we partially answer an open question by [CHLT19] that nearly interpolates between them. In particular, we show that if one has bounds up to the level-$k$ $L_1$ Fourier mass of a closely related class of functions, where $k&gt;2$, one can obtain improved seed length, the degree to which is determined by how high $k$ can be taken. Our analysis shows that for error $\epsilon=1/\text{poly}(n)$, one needs control at just level $O(\log n)$ to recover the seed length of [CHHL19], without assumptions on the entire tail. We avoid this by providing a simple, alternate analysis of their fractional PRG that instead relies on Taylor's theorem and $p$-biased Fourier analysis to avoid assumptions on the weights of the higher-order terms. This further allows us to show that this framework can handle the class of low-degree polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_2$, with slightly worse dependence than the current state-of-the-art, which was not previously known. We hope that this alternate analysis will be fruitful in improving the understanding of this new and powerful framework.</div>

<p>We’re back!  In our last <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/\average-case-dp">post</a> we discussed some of the subtle pitfalls of formulating the assumptions underlying average-case relaxations of differential privacy.  This time we’re going to look at the composition property of differential privacy—that is, the fact that running two independent differentially private algorithms on your data and combining their outputs is still differentially private. This is a key property of differential privacy and is actually closely related to the worst-case nature of differential privacy.</p>

<p>Composition is really the crucial property that has made differential privacy successful. Data analysis doesn’t happen in a vacuum, and the greatest threat to privacy comes from combining multiple pieces of information. These pieces of information can come from a single source that releases detailed statistics, or they could come from separate sources. So it’s critical to understand how the composition of multiple pieces of information can affect privacy.</p>

<p>In this post we’ll give some examples to illustrate why we need composition, and why composition is challenging for average-case relaxations of differential privacy.  Composition is what allows you to design sophisticated differentially private algorithms out of simple building blocks, and it’s what allows one organization to release differentially private statistics without having to understand the entire ecosystem of related information that has been or will be released.  As we’ll see, the challenges of composing average-case privacy guarantees are also very closely related to the subtleties that arise in thinking about the adversary’s beliefs.</p>

<h3 id="differencing-attacks">Differencing Attacks</h3>

<p>Let’s start with a simple example of composition that was alluded to in our last post.</p>

<p>You’ve just started a new job and signed up for the health insurance provided by your employer. Thus, your employer is able to obtain aggregated data from the insurance provider. In particular, your employer can ask “How many of our employees have submitted claims for condition X?”  However, your employer should not be able to find out whether or not <em>you</em> have condition X. 
For concreteness, condition X could be a mental health condition, drug addiction, being pregnant, terminal cancer, or an expensive chronic illness. Each of these could result in some kind of employment discrimination.</p>

<p>The employer may find out that 417 employees have condition X.  That’s OK; on its own, this number reveals very little about whether or not <em>you</em> have condition X, as long as your employer is uncertain about how many employees <em>other than you</em> have condition X.  We can formalize this as some kind of average-case or Bayesian privacy guarantee. Thus the health-insurance company is comfortable releasing this number exactly.  But, yesterday, before you started your job, it also seemed reasonable to allow your employer to ask the exact same question, and yesterday the answer was 416. Thus your employer concludes that you have condition X.</p>

<p>In this example, we see how two pieces of information—the count before you started and the count after you started—each of which seems innocuous on its own can be combined to reveal private information. This is a simple example of a <em>differencing attack</em> and composition is important in part because it prevents these attacks.</p>

<p>This example involves only two pieces of information. However, an attack could combine many pieces of information. For example, the counts could be broken down by sex, race/ethnicity, age, location, and tobacco use.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Additional data may also be obtained from other sources, such as public records, social media, voluntary disclosures, healthcare providers, financial records, employment records, or even illicit sources. The possibilities for attacks grow rapidly as more information is made available. And an employer is only one example of a potential privacy adversary.</p>

<p>The point of this example is that it’s easy to argue that one piece of information is harmless to privacy by making plausible-looking assumptions about the adversary. But this intuition rapidly breaks down once you consider the bigger picture where there are many pieces of information that can complete the puzzle. That’s why we need rigorous methods for understanding privacy and its composition.</p>

<h3 id="quantifying-composition">Quantifying Composition</h3>

<p>How does differential privacy prevent a differencing attack like the one we just discussed? The simplest way is to add a little bit of random noise to each answer. On the first day, instead of releasing the exact count 416, we could release a noisy count, say, 420. Then on the second day, instead of releasing the true count 417, we release another noisy count, say, 415. More precisely, it is common to add noise to counts drawn from a Laplace or Gaussian distribution.  These figures are still close enough to the true values to be useful, but the difference of 1 is now obscured by the noise, so your privacy is protected.</p>

<p>Since the noise is unknown to <em>any</em> potential adversary, it introduces uncertainty that protects the contribution that an individual makes to the count. Taking the difference of two independent noisy counts results in something that is still noisy. However, we must be careful to quantify this privacy guarantee, particularly when it comes to composition.</p>

<p>So, how much noise do we need to add? Let’s go back to the example and suppose the insurance company provides noisy answers where the noise has mean zero and some fixed variance. Your employer could simply ask the same question again and again and each time receive a different noisy answer. Averaging these noisy answers will effectively reduce the variance of the added noise and allow the true answer to be discerned. That leaves us back where we started.</p>

<p>The moral of this revised example is that the scale of the noise must increase if we allow more access to the data, so more questions means more noise in each answer.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> 
Asking the same question again and again may seem silly. There are easy ways to defend against this and some similar attacks. (E.g., by returning the same answer each time instead of generating fresh noise.) But, unfortunately, the underlying phenomenon cannot be circumvented. One of the seminal works that led to differential privacy <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/773153.773173" title="Irit Dinur, Kobbi Nissim. Revealing Information While Preserving Privacy. PODS 2003"><strong>[DN03]</strong></a> showed that there is an inherent tradeoff between the number of questions to be answered and the amount of noise that needs to be added to protect privacy. The general attack is simple: Instead of asking the same query again and again, the attacker asks “random” queries.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> This attack only requires basic linear algebra and, importantly, has been demonstrated on real systems <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05692" title="Aloni Cohen, Kobbi Nissim. Linear Program Reconstruction in Practice. 2018."><strong>[CN18]</strong></a>.</p>

<h3 id="adaptive-composition">Adaptive Composition</h3>

<p>There are actually two kinds of composition to consider. There is <strong>non-adaptive composition</strong>, where the questions to be asked are pre-specified and thus independent of the data, and there is <strong>adaptive composition</strong>, where the questions may themselves depend on the results of prior access to the data. Adaptive composition arises in an interactive system where queries are submitted one-by-one and each answer is returned before the next query is submitted. So far, we have really only considered non-adaptive composition.</p>

<p>Any interactive system must take adaptive composition into account.  A natural algorithm which asks adaptive questions is gradient descent for minimizing a function that is determined by private data (e.g., for logistic regression on medical records). At each step, the algorithm asks for a gradient of the function, which depends on the private data, at the current point. Then the point is updated according to the reported gradient and the process repeats. Since the updated point depends on the previous answer, the next gradient computation is adaptive.</p>

<p>The good news is that differential privacy can handle adaptive composition just fine.  However, to handle adaptive composition, it’s really important that you have a worst-case privacy definition like differential privacy. As we will see below, average-case variants of differential privacy cannot handle adaptive composition. Intuitively, the problem is that whatever distributional assumption you might make about the data or query a priori is unlikely to hold when you condition on past interactions with the same data or related data.</p>

<p>Here’s a technical example that shows the difficulty of adaptive composition. Our data \(x \in \{-1,+1\}^n\) is a vector of \(n\) bits, one bit per person.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>  Because we’re considering average-case differential privacy, we’ll model this vector as uniformly random.  Consider the following slightly odd algorithm \(M_2(x,v)\)—it takes a vector \(v \in \{-1,+1\}^n\) from the user, and, if the correlation \(\langle x, v \rangle / n\) between \(v\) and \(x\) is smaller than \(\varepsilon/2\), the query returns \(\emptyset\), but, if the correlation between \(v\) and \(x\) is larger than \(\varepsilon/2\), the query returns the dataset \(x\).  In isolation this algorithm satisfies an average-case version of differential privacy, because if \(n\) is large enough and \(x\) is uniformly random, then it’s very unlikely that the user can guess a vector \(v\) that causes this algorithm to output anything other than \(\emptyset\).  This algorithm may seem contrived; it is a simple stand-in for any algorithm that behaves very well most of the time, but fails completely on some rare inputs.</p>

<p>Now, consider another, more familiar differentially private algorithm called randomized response <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2283137?seq=1" title="Stanley Warner. Randomized Response: A Survey Technique for Eliminating Evasive Answer Bias. Journal of the American Statistical Association 1965."><strong>[W65]</strong></a>.  For those not familiar, this algorithm \(M_1(x)\) outputs a vector \(y \in \{-1,+1\}^n\), where \(y_i\) is slightly more likely to be \(x_i\) than \(-x_i\).  Specifically, we set \(y_i = x_i\) with probability \((1+\varepsilon)/2\) and \(y_i = - x_i\) otherwise. This satisfies \(\log(\frac{1+\varepsilon}{1-\varepsilon})\)-differential privacy or, roughly, \(2\varepsilon\)-differential privacy. The upshot is that we obtain a vector \(y\) where the correlation between \(x\) and \(y\) is about \(\varepsilon\), i.e. \(\langle x , y \rangle / n \approx \varepsilon\).</p>

<p>OK, so \(M_1\) and \(M_2\) both satisfy strong average-case versions of differential privacy when the data is uniform, but what about their composition?  Well, the bad news is that running \(y = M_1(x)\) followed by \(M_2(x,y)\) is going to return the dataset \(x\) with probability approaching 100%!  That’s because \(y\) was designed precisely to be a vector with correlation about \(\varepsilon\) with \(x\), and this is exactly the key that gets \(M_2\) to unlock the dataset.</p>

<p>What went wrong here is that, even if \(x\) really is uniformly random, it’s very far from it when conditioned on the output \(y=M_1(x)\). To analyze \(M_2(x,y)\) we must look at the distribution of \(x\) conditioned on \(y\). This distribution is going to be messy and may as well be a worst-case distribution, which means we must leave the realm of average-case privacy.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Composition guarantees that, as long as each part of your system is differentially private, then the overall system is too. It would be difficult to build sophisticated systems without this property. And it’s what allows one organization to release differentially private statistics without having to worry about what other information might be out there. In short, composition is what allows differential privacy to deal with the complexities of the real world.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that differential privacy would have taken off as a field of research without this composition property. Any proposal for an alternative approach to privacy-preserving data analysis should first be evaluated in terms of how it handles composition.</p>

<p>This post only scratches the surface. In particular, we haven’t talked about the quantitative aspects of composition; that’s where the fun really begins. We will leave you with some pointers to further reading on the topic:</p>

      <p>A good rule of thumb is that, if the number of released values is much larger than the number of people, then a privacy attack is probably possible.

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06045">Rota’s Basis Conjecture holds asymptotically</a>, by Alexey <span style="color: #000000;">Pokrovskiy</span></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Rota’s Basis Conjecture is a well known problem from matroid theory, that states that for any collection of n bases in a rank n matroid, it is possible to decompose all the elements into n disjoint rainbow bases. Here an asymptotic version of this is proved. We show that it is possible to find <em>n − o(n)</em> disjoint rainbow independent sets of size <em>n − o(n)</em>.</p>

<p>(I thank Nati Linial for telling me about it.)</p>
<p>Another way to formulate Rota’s basis conjecture (for representable matroids) is that if <em>B</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>B</em><sub>2</sub>, …, <em>B<sub>n</sub></em> are <em>n</em> bases of an <em>n</em>-dimensional vector space <em>V</em> (not necessarily distinct or disjoint), then there exists an <em>n</em> × <em>n</em> grid of vectors (<em>v<sub>ij</sub></em>) such that</p>
<p>1. the <em>n</em> vectors in row <em>i</em> are the members of the <em>i</em>th basis <em>B<sub>i</sub></em> (in some order), and</p>
<p>2. in each column of the matrix, the <em>n</em> vectors in that column form a basis of <em>V</em>.</p>
<p>If all the bases are the standard basis then this reduces to the existence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square">Latin squares</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Unrelated trivia question:</strong>  AGC-GTC-TGC-GTC-TGC-GAC-GATC-? what comes next in the sequence?</p>
<p>We mentioned Rota’s basis conjecture in various earlier posts.  A classic paper on the subject is the <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/huang-rota.pdf">1989 paper by Rosa Huang and Gian Carlo-Rota</a>. Three and a half years ago Timothy Chow lunched a polymath project (Polymath 12) to solve it. (Here is my<a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2017/02/26/timothy-chow-launched-polymath12-on-rota-basis-conjecture-and-other-news/"> post on the project with various variants of the conjecture</a>, the <a href="https://polymathprojects.org/2017/02/23/rotas-basis-conjecture-polymath-12/">first post on the polymath blog</a>, and the <a href="https://asone.ai/polymath/index.php?title=Rota%27s_conjecture">wiki</a>).

<p>
Keith Conrad is a professor in the mathematics department at UCONN—the University of Connecticut. My dear wife Kathryn Farley and I are about to move to join him—not as faculty but as another resident of the “Constitution State.”</p>
<p>
Today we thank him for his work on explaining mathematics.</p>
<p>
Conrad is a prolific writer of articles on mathematics. He makes hard concepts clear, he makes easy concepts interesting. He has a sense of humor; his <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu">website</a> is filled with fun of all kinds.</p>
<p>
He has interesting license plates, photos of streets that bear his first name, a Russian <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/">update</a> to Tom Lehrer’s “Elements” song, and more links to others’ items. </p>
<p>
If you’d like a video example of fun see <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/d2OKd.gif">this</a> for a short video illusion. Too bad it is an illusion and it does not work in reality. As a chocolate lover I wish it worked—free chocolate forever. A similar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_square_puzzle">illusion</a> with a triangle was once featured by Martin Gardner, leading Ken as a teenager to make a cardboard cutout version overlaid on a map of the Bermuda Triangle as an “explanation” of disappearances there.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Articles </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I have not yet met Conrad in person, but have enjoyed reading his articles on math of all kinds. He has a giant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B63+%5Ctimes+4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{63 \times 4}" class="latex" title="{63 \times 4}" /> <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/">grid</a> of clickable titles, grouped by subject area. </p>
<p>
For an example, he has a <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/galoistheory/numbersoncircle.pdf">title</a> “Roots on a Circle.” The file name says “numbers on a circle” and the essay begins disarmingly enough with a picture of the 7th roots of unity. The next page shows a simple polynomial where most but not all roots lie on the circle:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/thanks-to-an-explainer/lehmerspolynomialroots/" rel="attachment wp-att-17412"><img width="300" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/lehmerspolynomialroots.jpg?w=300&amp;h=161" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17412" height="161" /></a></p>
<p>
This is enough to draw you in and stay attached as things become more complicated beginning on page 3. It helps that Conrad does not stint on algebraic details. This essay supplements a cautionary tale in mathematics: a <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/15444/examples-of-eventual-counterexamples">link</a> to a MathOverflow list whose top item is that the factors of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5En+-+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x^n - 1}" class="latex" title="{x^n - 1}" /> over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BQ%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathbb{Q}}" class="latex" title="{\mathbb{Q}}" /> have no coefficient of absolute value greater than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3D+1%2C%5Cdots%2C104%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n = 1,\dots,104}" class="latex" title="{n = 1,\dots,104}" />. Before you try to prove this by induction check out <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3D+105%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n = 105}" class="latex" title="{n = 105}" />.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Finite Groups </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
One of my favorite articles is <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/grouptheory/order.pdf">titled</a>, “Orders Of Elements In A Group.” Conrad starts with the humble concept of the order of an element in a group. Then he builds up a theory that explains various properties of order. </p>
<p>
I especially like that he supplies examples to help you with your intuition. For me, and Ken, finite groups are just counter-intuitive. Groups have magical properties but my naive conjectures about them usually fail. Conrad’s article ends with a discussion of primality testing which is dear to us in complexity theory.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Finite Groups that Encode Information </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I recently needed a finite group with a certain structure. In complexity theory we sometimes use matrices to encode information in a way that makes an algorithm more efficient. Algorithms like matrices since they can be stored and multiplied efficiently. As an example, suupose that we have two matrices <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" /> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++AB+%3D+-BA.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  AB = -BA. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  AB = -BA. " /></p>
<p>That is the matrices anti-commute. Then we can use such matrices to encode information about a string <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%2CB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A,B}" class="latex" title="{A,B}" />‘s. Every string <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" /> can be written as: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cpm+A%5E%7Bk%7DB%5E%7Bl%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \pm A^{k}B^{l}. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \pm A^{k}B^{l}. " /></p>
<p>The <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\pm}" class="latex" title="{\pm}" /> encodes the number of inversions in the string <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" />. That is the number of times <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" /> is followed by an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cdots+B+%5Cdots+A+%5Cdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \dots B \dots A \dots " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \dots B \dots A \dots " /></p>
<p>So <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BABBA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{ABBA}" class="latex" title="{ABBA}" /> has <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" /> inversions, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BAAABA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{AAABA}" class="latex" title="{AAABA}" /> has <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />. Here are matrices that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Clifford_algebra">anti-commute</a>. </p>
<p></p><p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++A+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D+0%261%5C%5C+1%260+%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  A = \begin{pmatrix} 0&amp;1\\ 1&amp;0 \end{pmatrix}" class="latex" title="\displaystyle  A = \begin{pmatrix} 0&amp;1\\ 1&amp;0 \end{pmatrix}" /></p>
<p></p><p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++B+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D+1%260%5C%5C+0%26-1+%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  B = \begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;0\\ 0&amp;-1 \end{pmatrix}" class="latex" title="\displaystyle  B = \begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;0\\ 0&amp;-1 \end{pmatrix}" /></p>
<p>
We can do even better. There are matrices so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++AB+%3D+%5Clambda+BA%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  AB = \lambda BA, " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  AB = \lambda BA, " /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\lambda}" class="latex" title="{\lambda}" /> is a root of unity.

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>After nine years, <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/people/jos-baeten" target="_blank">Jos Baeten</a> will step down as general director of <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/" target="_blank">CWI</a> on 30 September 2020 and there will be a <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/events/2020/farewell-symposium-jos-baeten/symposium-retirement-jos-baeten" target="_blank">retirement symposium</a> in his honour on 1 October 2020. (Jos Baeten's successor will be <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/ton-de-kok/" target="_blank">Tom de Kok</a>. You can read the CWI news item related to Tom de Kok's appointment <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/news/2020/ton-de-kok-appointed-new-director-of-cwi" target="_blank">here</a>. Tom de Kok, just like Jos Baeten before him, joins CWI from Eindhoven University of Technology.) </p><p>Jos Baeten has been one of the prime movers in the development of process algebra since 1987, and has been the driving force behind the CONCUR conference series and the CONCUR Basic Research Actions in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. Apart from being general director of CWI, he has served the TCS community in a variety of roles and organisations, and has helped to connect the work of the concurrency-theory community with that done in control and mechanical engineering. He has also supervised more than 30 PhD theses. </p><p>I asked Jos a few questions via email and I am happy to share his answers with the readers of this blog. Thanks to Jos for all the contributions he has given to the research community throughout his career, and for sharing his opinions and reminiscences with us! </p><p><b>The interview</b> </p><p><b>Luca:</b> Let's start from the beginning. If I remember correctly, your background was in model theory. Could you tell us what prompted you to move to doing research in computer science? </p><p><b>Jos:</b> I have a Master in logic and foundations of mathematics (with a minor in philosophy) from Utrecht University, with a Master’s thesis on lambda calculus, and a PhD in logic and foundations of mathematics from the University of Minnesota, with a PhD thesis on definability theory (a cross between recursion theory and set theory) entitled "<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0099378" target="_blank">Filters and ultrafilters over definable subsets of admissible ordinals</a>". Returning from the US, I got a job teaching undergraduate maths at Delft University. But I wanted getting into research, and meeting <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/j.a.bergstra/" target="_blank">Jan Bergstra</a> he said there were lots of opportunities in computer science research, not in maths. Writing a paper with him and <a href="https://www.cs.vu.nl/~jwk/" target="_blank">Jan Willem Klop</a> on term rewriting systems would qualify me, he said. So it happened, and I got a postdoc at CWI in the framework of the ESPRIT I project. I kept on doing maths, but it was called computer science. </p><p><b>Luca:</b> I have heard that you were recruited by Jan Bergstra and Jan Willem Klop to work within their group at the CWI, and that <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~rvg/" target="_blank">Rob van Glabbeek</a> joined the team soon after you. Could you tell us about the environment at the CWI at that time? It must have been a very exciting place to be with all the activity related to work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_of_communicating_processes#:~:text=The%20algebra%20of%20communicating%20processes,process%20algebras%20or%20process%20calculi." target="_blank">ACP</a> and related topics. </p><p><b>Jos:</b> It was a heady period. The group of Jan and Jan Willem was expanding rapidly on EU money, with me, Rob van Glabbeek and <a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~fvaan/" target="_blank">Frits Vaandrager.</a> I really liked ACP and doing universal algebra. </p><p><b>Luca:</b> What was your first paper in CS about? Which paper from your initial period at the CWI are you most proud of? </p><p><b>Jos:</b> My first paper was "<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225810594_Term_rewriting_systems_with_priorities" target="_blank">On term rewriting, Term rewriting systems with priorities</a>". I am most proud of my first ACP paper, "<a href="https://pure.tue.nl/ws/files/2137499/335911.pdf" target="_blank">Syntax and defining equations for an interrupt mechanism in process algebra</a>". This is about adding the priority operator. For axiomatisation, it needed an auxiliary operator that later turned out to be almost optimal. I came up with an axiomatisation, and Jan Bergstra forced me to prove it correct by doing all the critical pairs. I found a small error in pair 101 (of the 102 pairs), corrected it and proved the result correct. This all in a couple of weeks. </p><p><b>Luca:</b> Let's move on to the CONCUR project: How did it come about and what was its legacy? I recall that you came to visit <a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Matthew.Hennessy/" target="_blank">Matthew Hennessy</a> at the University of Sussex when I was a PhD student there to discuss the CONCUR proposal. How did you become involved in leading such a large and high profile group of researchers so early in your career at the CWI? What was it like to lead the CONCUR project?  <br /></p><p><b>Jos:</b> This is again due to Jan Bergstra: he believes in delegating responsibilities quickly. When the new instrument of Basic Research Action came up in the EU, he wanted a BRA with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare" target="_blank">Hoare</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Milner" target="_blank">Milner </a>and Hennessy. I got the assignment and made a trip to the UK visiting all three, and got all of them on board. The idea of the project was unification, but that did not come about, everyone kept doing their own thing. We did, however, produce excellent papers, including the curious </p><p>J.C.M. Baeten, J.A. Bergstra, C.A.R. Hoare, R. Milner, J. Parrow &amp; R. de Simone, The variety of process algebra. Deliverable ESPRIT Basic Research Action 3006, CONCUR, University of Edinburgh 1991 </p><p><b>Luca:</b> How would you summarize the history of the conference CONCUR? Can it be split into different periods, and if so, what characterizes them? </p><p><b>Jos:</b> CONCUR 90, which was the first CONCUR conference, was organised by BRA CONCUR, but with speakers from all 5 BRA’s in the area of concurrency; in 1991 Milner did not want such a conference to occur in Edinburgh, so Jan Bergstra and I did it again in Amsterdam. Then, we involved <a href="https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/ScottSmolka" target="_blank">Scott Smolka</a> for 1992 and after that, it was established, with a steering committee comprised of representatives from the 5 BRAs and Scott. As of 1993, it was firmly established, we found a niche and time period (end of August, beginning of September). All branches of concurrency were involved from the start, and over the years, it shows fashion clearly, for instance in certain years there was a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A0-calculus" target="_blank">pi-calculus</a>. </p><p><b>Luca:</b> In the 80s and the 90s there were three "schools" in process algebra,     the ACP, CCS, and CSP schools. With the benefit of hindsight, which were heir main contributions? To which extent have they converged? Is this classification still important for current research? </p><p><b>Jos:</b> I refer to my paper  <br /></p><p>J.C.M. Baeten, <a href="https://pure.tue.nl/ws/files/2154050/200402.pdf" target="_blank">A brief history of process algebra</a>. Theoretical Computer Science 335 (2/3), 2005, pp. 131-146.  <br /></p><p>I do a comparison in there. In my opinion, the book  <br /></p><p>J.C.M. Baeten, T. Basten and M.A. Reniers, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/process-algebra-equational-theories-of-communicating-processes/0A091BDAA17DA4D3D30FCD6F52E0E6B8" target="_blank">Process Algebra: Equational Theories for Communicating Processes</a>. Cambridge Tract in Theoretical Computer Science 50, Cambridge University Press 2010  <br /></p><p>has the unification, presenting all three in the same framework. However, process algebra is out of fashion, so who cares? </p><p><b>Luca:</b>  When did you become interested in supervisory control? What motivated you to apply techniques from process algebra in that research field? Looking at the outcome of that work, both in theory and in practice, that was a very good move! Could you tell us about the position you had in Mechanical Engineering? How did it come about and what was it like to work in that department? </p><p><b>Jos:</b> More than 20 years in the department of computer science, having been dean twice, I got to know the university very well indeed. <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/je-koos-rooda" target="_blank">Koos Rooda</a>, professor of systems engineering at Mechanical Engineering, requested my assistance to get more software engineering into systems engineering, to replace his cooperation with Martin Rem, who became rector. In particular, he was interested in the combination of discrete event reasoning (i.e., process algebra) with the continuous mathematics of systems and control. Having done process algebra with timing and probabilities, I was willing to take up this challenge. Upon his retirement, with the vigorous backing of the dean of Mechanical Engineering at the time, I took over his position. At mid-life, I was ready for a change. I liked the hands-on attitude of mechanical engineering students, who are no good at theory or proofs, but are very good in using mathematics and trying out software tools. But then, I was asked to apply to the vacancy of director of CWI. This was the job I had always wanted. I had enjoyed being dean and doing research management, and CWI is a very prestigious institute with (at that time) very independent management. </p><p> </p><p><b>Luca:</b> Back at CWI: What skills do you think one needs to be the director of such a high-profile institute? What was your vision for the CWI and how much of it did you manage to achieve? What role do you think the CWI can/should have in the coming decade and beyond? </p><p><b>Jos:</b> The most important skill is hiring those early career scientists that grow out to become top scientists. Internally, you have to manage your key personnel, operating by consensus and compromise. Externally, you have to find your way in national science politics and always justify your existence. The growing tension between Dutch universities and Dutch extra-university research institutes has almost defeated me, but I managed to complete my term until retirement, and leave CWI in good shape, to my opinion. I managed to keep the excellent reputation of the institute, and also managed to bring in dynamics, rejuvenation and new subjects. What I did not achieve, is that CWI again becomes a publisher, and publishes diamond journals. </p><p><b>Luca:</b> You have played a role in organizations such as the EATCS, ERCIM and IFIP. Do you think that such societies still play a role today? How do think they should evolve to fulfill their mission? </p><p><b>Jos:</b> I do, but they have to keep evolving if they want to stay relevant. It is a pity that the EATCS could not take a role in the open access movement (you certainly made a very good effort!). I think ERCIM is doing ok, but not great. IFIP, I think, has become irrelevant. </p><p><b>Luca:</b> You have been a strong supporter of open access. What is your opinion of the state of play in open access and what do you think we could do to move forward? </p><p><b>Jos:</b> Progress is slow but exists. I am a strong advocate of Plan S, that has really set some things in motion. A key point is that it looks like we can achieve immediate green, and still allow all researchers to submit articles wherever they want. I do not like the way it is going with transformative agreements, you'd think that by now, publishers would be putting all their efforts to become sellers of data analytics services.</p><p><b>Acknowledgements:</b> I thank <a href="https://www7.in.tum.de/~esparza/" target="_blank">Javier Esparza</a>, the chair of the CONCUR Steering Committee, for contributing some the questions to Jos.  <br /></p></div>

<p><i>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04859">new paper</a>, we develop a
framework for simulating realistic subpopulation shifts between training
and deployment conditions for machine learning models. Evaluating
standard models on the resulting benchmarks reveals that these models
are highly sensitive to such shifts. Moreover, training models to be
invariant to existing families of synthetic data perturbations falls
short of remedying this issue.   </i></p>

<p>Consider what is probably the most prototypical classification task:
distinguishing between pictures of dogs and cats. By now, we have a fairly
established approach to tackling this task. It involves sourcing a set of
(labeled) cat and dog pictures and then training our model on that set.
Intuitively, we understand that for this approach to succeed our training set
has to be sufficiently large and diverse, capturing a variety of real-world
conditions. In particular, one might want to make sure that it contains
representatives of many of the possible breeds of dogs and cats. Is it critical
though that <i>all</i> breeds are represented? That is, if our classifier truly
learns how to distinguish dogs from cats, wouldn’t we expect it to generalize to
unseen breeds as well?</p>

<p>This is just an illustration of a broader challenge: building ML models that are
robust to <i>subpopulation shift</i>, i.e., they are able to generalize to data
subpopulations that were not encountered during training. This notion of
robustness is essential for models to perform reliably in the real world. After
all, we cannot expect our training set to capture all possible subpopulation
variations it can encounter during deployment. (Think of, e.g., differences in
weather/road conditions in the context of self-driving cars, or variability in
diagnostic equipment and patients’s exact characteristics in the
context of medical applications.)</p>

<h2 id="tackling-subpopulation-shifts">Tackling subpopulation shifts</h2>

<p>To make progress on this challenge, we need to first develop a principled way to
measure such robustness (or lack thereof). So, how can we measure the extent to
which our models are robust to such train-test subpopulation shifts?</p>

<p>A natural approach would be to first partition the subpopulations present in data for each class (e.g., dog or cat breeds) into two
disjoint sets: one set that is used for training the model, and one set that is held-out for
evaluation. Then, one can just examine the performance of the model on the held-out data.</p>

<p>This setup ensures that the actual task remains unchanged between
training and testing—i.e., classifying inputs into the original
classes (“dog” vs. “cat”). Therefore, the observed performance can give
us a sense how well that model will perform when exposed to novel data
subpopulations encountered during deployment.</p>

<p>The chief difficulty in implementing this strategy, however, is that
standard datasets do not contain annotations that are fine-grained
enough to identify the subpopulations of interest. Also, rectifying this
issue by collecting additional human annotations would be complicated
(not every class lends itself to identifying a natural and explicit
subpopulation structure) and costly (due to the scale of
state-of-the-art classification datasets).</p>

<p>In this post, we will outline an approach that circumvents some of the
aforementioned issues, allowing us to automatically construct a suite of
subpopulation shift benchmarks of varying difficulty, with minimal effort.</p>

<h2 id="the-breeds-methodology">The <span class="sc">Breeds</span> methodology</h2>

<p>Our approach is to <i>simulate</i> class subpopulations by grouping semantically
similar classes into <i>super</i>classes (e.g., aggregate the 100+ dog breed classes
in ImageNet into a “dog superclass”). Then, considering the classification task
over such superclasses enables us to repurpose the original dataset annotations
as explicit indicators of the subpopulation structure. Note that this new task
is entirely based on <em>existing</em> datasets, so we do not need to deal with,
gathering new data points or annotations, hence avoiding the additional biases
these might introduce (see our previous posts on
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/data_rep_bias">dataset replication</a> and
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/benchmarks">annotation pipelines</a>).</p>

<p>After this task restructuring, we can train our model on the resulting
superclass classification task while having full control over  which
subpopulations are included in training and which subpopulations are encountered
during testing. For example, if our original dataset contains classes: Labrador,
Husky, Tabby cat, and Persian cat, which we group into “dog” and “cat”
superclasses as [Labrador, Husky] and [Tabby cat, Persian cat], we can train a
model on the Labrador vs. Tabby cat task and test how well it can distinguish
Huskies from Persian cats. (Note that this framework can also naturally
incorporate milder subpopulation shifts where test subpopulations are
underrepresented, but not entirely missing, in the training set—see
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02060">here</a>.) Pictorially:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/breeds/figures/pipeline.png" class="bigimg" id="pipeline" /></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Overview of the <span class="sc">Breeds</span>
methodology.</strong> We group classes into superclasses and derive a
classification task over superclasses. Then we randomly assign each of the
original classes to be used for training (source) or evaluation (target) of the
model, thus inducing a subpopulation shift between training and testing
conditions. By controlling the granularity of the superclass grouping we can
construct shifts of varying severity.</div>

<p>The dog vs. cat breeds example served as the motivation for our
framework (as well as its name), but the underlying principle is quite
general. In fact, we can (and do) apply this methodology to group
together a wide variety of classes that share similar characteristics.</p>

<h3 id="obtaining-meaningful-superclasses">Obtaining meaningful superclasses</h3>

<p>In order for such a “breeds” benchmark be tractable from an image classification
viewpoint, we need to ensure that the classes we group together into
superclasses actually share visual characteristics. (After all, we cannot expect
a model to generalize across an arbitrary train-test partition of classes).
Ideally, we would group dataset classes based on a hierarchy that captures their
<i>visual</i> similarity—thus, allowing us to construct superclasses of varying
granularity (which would lead to benchmarks of varying difficulty).</p>

<div class="footnote">     
  <strong>Note:</strong> Having access to a class
hierarchy is a relatively mild requirement. Most of the popular vision datasets
are already equipped with such a hierarchy (e.g., CIFAR-100, ImageNet, PASCAL-
VOC and OpenImages). Even in cases where an explicit class hierarchy is missing,
it is more likely than not that the dataset classes obey some natural groupings
which could be recovered either manually, or with the assistance of proxies such
as word embeddings. 
</div>

<p>From this point of view, the ImageNet dataset is a natural candidate for
building our benchmarks—aside from its breadth and scale, it also comes
equipped with a class hierarchy, i.e., the <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet hierarchy</a>. However,
taking a closer look at that hierarchy reveals a few important shortcomings: (a)
classes are grouped together based on abstract (as opposed to visual)
characteristics (e.g., “umbrella” and “roof” are both “coverings); (b) nodes at
the same level of the hierarchy can have vastly different granularity (e.g.,
“street sign” and “living thing”), not necessarily mirroring the specificity of
the class itself; and (c) the hierarchy is not a tree (e.g., “bread” is in both
“starches” and “baked goods”). Grouping ImageNet classes based on this hierarchy
would thus result in poorly calibrated tasks.</p>

<p>All these shortcomings stem from the fact that WordNet is a <em>semantic</em> rather
than <em>visual</em> hierarchy—words are grouped together based on their meaning
rather than the visual appearance of the objects they correspond to. To remedy
this, we performed extensive edits to the existing ImageNet class hierarchy to
better capture visual object similarity. Specifically, we removed all abstract
nodes (e.g., “covering”) and calibrated the depth to ensure that nodes at the
same level have comparable granularity (by adding/removing redundant
nodes)—the modified hierarchy can be explored 
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/breeds_class_hierarchy">here</a> or through the
notebook we provide in the <a href="https://github.com/MadryLab/BREEDS-Benchmarks">code repo</a>.</p>

<h3 id="constructing-breeds-benchmarks">Constructing <span class="sc">Breeds</span> benchmarks</h3>

<p>Equipped with such a modified class hierarchy, we can construct subpopulation
shift benchmarks of varying difficulty in an essentially automated manner: we
simply choose a level of the hierarchy and treat each node at that level as a
superclass. The original dataset classes that are descendants of this node then
become the subclasses or “breeds”. These subclasses are then split
<em>randomly</em> into two groups—one of these is used to sample

<h3 id="validating-the-benchmarks-using-human-annotation">Validating the benchmarks using human annotation</h3>

<p>As already discussed, to ensure that the benchmarks we create are actually
meaningful, we need to validate that the superclasses therein contain visually
coherent subpopulations, so that good cross-subpopulation generalization is
possible. To this end, we leverage human annotators to measure the robustness of
humans to the subpopulation shifts encapsulated by (simplified versions of)
<span class="sc">Breeds</span> tasks. Specifically, we randomly pick pairs of superclasses and then show
annotators two groups of images corresponding to samples from the source domain
of the respective superclasses. Then, we present them with random images from
the target domain of <em>both</em> superclasses (mixed together) and ask them to assign
these images to one of the two groups (superclasses). Crucially, we do <em>not</em>
reveal to the annotators the name of either of the superclasses. Here is what
the task looks like:</p>

<div>
  <img width="80%" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/breeds/figures/task.png" class="bigimg" id="pipeline" />
</div>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Illustration of subpopulation shift task presented 
to annotators.</strong> Annotators are shown random images from the source
domains of two random superclasses. Then, they are presented with images from
the target domains of these superclasses and asked to assign them into the
correct superclass.</div>

<p>If our superclasses are indeed well-calibrated for the task, annotators should
be able to associate new images with the correct group. That is, images from the
target domain of a superclass should be more similar to the source domain of the
<em>same</em> superclass, rather than the other one. Also, to establish a baseline, we
repeat the same experiment while asking the annotators to classify unseen
samples from the source domain (i.e., when there is no subpopulation shift).</p>

<p>So how well do our annotators perform?</p>

<div class="footnote"> <strong>Annotator performance on <span class="sc">Breeds</span> tasks.</strong> Annotators are quite robust to subpopulation shift.
Their ability to identify the correct superclass does not change significantly
between the source and the target domain, especially for the
<span class="sc">Living-17</span> and <span class="sc">Entity-30</span>
benchmarks. </div>

<p>As we can see, the difference in average annotator accuracy (in terms of
classifying unseen inputs into the correct group/superclass) between the source
and target domain is quite small. This suggests that the superclasses do indeed
correspond to visually meaningful object groupings, and, moreover, that humans
are quite robust to the distribution shifts captured within the <span class="sc">Breeds</span> tasks.
Let us now compare this drop to the one that our models incur.</p>

<p>To assess whether standard models are sensitive to subpopulation shifts, we
will, for each <span class="sc">Breeds</span> task, train a number of standard architectures to
distinguish between the corresponding superclasses, using data from the source
domain and then measure model performance on data from the target domain.
Specifically, we will plot the <em>target accuracy</em> of each model as a function of
its <em>source accuracy</em>.</p>

<p>Across the board, all models suffer a clear drop in performance under
subpopulation shifts—-accuracy drops by more than 30 percentage points between
the source and target domains. This indicates that the features models rely on
to perform well are somewhat specific to the subpopulations they encounter
during training, and thus tend to lose their predictive power even under
seemingly mild shifts in test-time subpopulations. 
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/feed.xml#anno_model" id="reveal_model">[CLICK THIS to compare model
performance to that of human annotators.]</a></p>

<p>A natural question to ask then is: can these models be adapted to the target
domain by simply re-training their last layer with data from this domain? 
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/feed.xml#std_ft" id="reveal_retrain">[CLICK THIS to add the re-training 
line.]</a> The answer seems to be nuanced. On one hand,
re-training significantly increases model performance, indicating that the
representations learned in the earlier layers of these (source-domain trained)
models are useful also for the subpopulations in the target domain. On the other
hand, these representations still fall short of what one would hope for—the
target accuracy post retraining remains much lower than that of a model trained
directly on the target domain.</p>

<h3 id="robustness-interventions">Robustness interventions</h3>

<p>Given that standard models turned out to be very sensitive to subpopulation
shifts, one might hope that applying a number of existing robustness
interventions—designed to increase model robustness to specific synthetic
perturbations—might change this state of affairs. To assess this, we
evaluate the subpopulation shift robustness of classifiers that have been
trained: (a) via <a href="https://gradientscience.org/robust_opt_pt1">robust optimization</a> against L2 adversaries of
different epsilon; (b) on a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12231">stylized version</a> of ImageNet (relying less on
texture and thus more on shape); and (c) with random noise (Gaussian or
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04896">Erase</a>).</p>

<p>To control for the significant impact on the standard (source) accuracy that
these methods can have, we focus on  the <em>relative target accuracy</em> of the
resulting models—that is the fraction of accuracy that is preserved in the
target domain (target accuracy over source accuracy).</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/breeds/figures/intervene.png" class="bigimg" id="intervene" />
</div>
<div class="footnote">
<strong>Effect of train-time interventions on subpopulation shift robustness.</strong>
We plot the ratio of the target accuracy to the source accuracy as a function of
the source accuracy. Train-time interventions have small, yet non-trivial,
impact on model robustness.
</div>

<p>We observe that these robustness interventions do have an impact on the target
accuracy of the model. Moreover, even when the resulting models have comparable
source accuracies, their target accuracies can be quite different. For instance,
erase noise improves robustness without particularly impacting source accuracy
(relative to standard models), while adversarially trained models improve
robustness at the expense of source accuracy. Overall, these results indicate
that while existing interventions make models slightly less sensitive to
subpopulation shifts, there is still significant room for improvement.</p>

<p>To obtain a more complete picture, we also measure the performance of the above
models after retraining the final layer with data from the target domain. Again,
our goal is to understand whether the employed training methods lead to
representations that are more general, and can be directly repurposed for the
target domain.</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/breeds/figures/intervene_ft.png" class="bigimg" id="intervene_ft" />
</div>
<div class="footnote">
<strong>Adapting model trained with robustness interventions for subpopulation shift.</strong> We plot model accuracy on the target domain after re-training the last layer on that domain. We can see that adversarially-trained model have significantly better accuracy, in certain cases almost recovering the original source accuracy.
</div>

<p>Interestingly, we see that models trained with erase noise are not better than
standard models after we allow for such fine-tuning. This indicates that the
gain in robustness it provides may not stem from learning better
representations. In contrast, adversarially trained models are significantly
better than other models (including standard ones) after fine-tuning. This is in
line with recent results showing that adversarially trained models are more
suited for transfer learning (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05869">here</a> and
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08489">here</a>). At
the same time, models trained on the stylized version of ImageNet are
consistently worse than other models, even relative to models with similar
source accuracy. This could indicate that texture is a particularly useful
feature for this classification task, especially in the presence of
subpopulation shift.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>In this post, we demonstrate how one can utilize a class
hierarchy to simulate a range of subpopulation shifts within existing
classification datasets. These shifts turn out to pose a challenge for standard
models (seemingly more so than for humans) and this challenge cannot really be
overcome using existing robustness interventions or re-training the last
layer. Thus, there is a need for designing new methods to address this core
robustness requirement. Overall, we believe that subpopulation shifts are an
important piece of the robustness puzzle and we hope that the benchmarks we
develop will serve as a guide for future progress on this front.</p></div>

We prove that parallel repetition of the (3-player) GHZ game reduces the value of the game polynomially fast to 0. That is, the value of the GHZ game repeated in parallel $t$ times is at most $t^{-\Omega(1)}$. Previously, only a bound of $\approx \frac{1}{\alpha(t)}$, where $\alpha$ is the inverse Ackermann function, was known.

The GHZ game was recently identified by Dinur, Harsha, Venkat and Yuen as a multi-player game where all existing techniques for proving strong bounds on the value of the parallel repetition of the game fail. Indeed, to prove our result we use a completely new proof technique. Dinur, Harsha, Venkat and Yuen speculated that progress on bounding the value of the parallel repetition of the GHZ game may lead to further progress on the general question of parallel repetition of multi-player games. They suggested that the strong correlations present in the GHZ question distribution represent the ``hardest instance'' of the multi-player parallel repetition problem.

Another motivation for studying the parallel repetition of the GHZ game comes from the field of quantum information. The GHZ game, first introduced by Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger, is a central game in the study of quantum entanglement and has been studied in numerous works. For example, it is used for testing quantum entanglement and for device-independent quantum cryptography. In such applications a game is typically repeated to reduce the probability of error, and hence bounds on the value of the parallel repetition of the game may be useful.</div>

<p> </p><p>1) Contrast the following two points and, if you have an intelligent way to fill-in-the-blank for the second one, please comment.</p><p>a) When Trump says `open the schools or I will cut of funding' I disagree, or at least he should talk more about how to do it carefully BUT there is an underlying important and serious issue: how to balance health and education. Similar for when he talks about opening up business's - how to balance heath and the economy.</p><p>b) When Trump says `hydroxychloroquine is a potential cure for covid' I (and most of the medical community) disagree, BUT FILL IN THE BLANK. Is there SOME serious issue involved here that I am just missing?</p><p>2) I have seen several approaches to large gathering, say Churchs, beach parties, motorcycle meeting etc. </p><p>a) DO IT ONLINE.  UMCP classes will be on-line in the fall. My church has been online since mid March and seems like it will do the same in the fall. (Note- Choir is much worse than normal talking for spreading it, so Choir might not resume for a much longer time than Church).</p><p>b) HAVE THEM but SOCIAL DISTANCE and MASKS and other precautions. And it works. I hope it works.</p><p>c) HAVE THEM, realize that there IS an issue, TRY to do some of the precautions, but fail. This may be what has happened at some high schools, see <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/9-people-test-positive-at-georgia-school-with-photo-of-crowded-hallway?ref=home">Here</a>.</p><p>d) HAVE THEM and ignore ALL precautions either because </p><p>i) God will protect you</p><p>ii) The Government is not my boss. Such people are usually pro-business so they should NOT mind if a business on its own requires masks and SHOULD mind if its the government. I have not seen them making that distinction. Such people are usually against Federalism and for localism. So they should be upset when a Prez or a Gov overides a Mayor's Mask Mandate. I have not seen this.</p><p>iii) The whole think is a Hoax. How can people still believe this?</p><p>These three may overlap.</p><p>3) The Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota seems to believe ii and iii. Can someone give any rational reason why they want to have this rally and why its allowed to happen. Given how many people come (usually 250,000- less now?) from all across the country, this could make thinks far far worse. But see next point.</p><p>4) Libertarians think that there is too much Government in our lives. This is a fair point of view but it needs to be tested on a case by case basis. There are some things that REQUIRE a more national response. When this happens Libertarians have two choices:</p><p>a) Apply their thinking to figure out how Gov can help with the least damage. For example, Carbon tax for global warning. In the current pandemic they might have LOCAL govs pass mandatory mask laws.. Or they would at least set a good example by wearing masks themselves. Perhaps relax regulations on medical stuff so that companies can work together without worrying about anti-trust, and perhaps look more carefully at regulations that get in the way (might be a good idea anyway).</p><p>b) Deny its a problem. Man made Global Warming is a myth. Covid is a hoax. Hence its okay to have the Motorcycle Rally. But the problem is, this doesn't just harm the people showing up, it harms others as well.</p><p>5) Early on I was puzzled that Trump didn't care more since older people (his base!) are at more risk. Did he think it would only affect democrats (early on NY was hit badly). Why didn't his advisors tell him that it would kill his own base?I ASK NON-RHETORICALLY  Or did they and he didn't list. My point is, for purely selfish reasons Trump should have taken more action earlier, so I am surprised he did not. See next point.</p><p>6) Trump could have even taken action in a Trumpian way:</p><p>The Chinese and the Democrats are waging a bio-war on real Americans (white rural older) !!! We will STOP them in their tracks and show them they can't mess with us!!  I will LOCKDOWN some cities AND provide online stuff to schools, business's (my cronies)  and churchs (SCREW that stupid sep of church and state- that was only one passage in a letter Thomas Jefferson wrote).  </p><p>He might have even got Democrats to complain that it will choke the economy and hurt the poor, and that giving stuff to churchs is against the constitution (it prob is). </p><p>7) If a vax for covid is found, will Trump urge his base (some of whom are anti-vax) to take it? Having said that, if it comes out in October it may be untested so I doubt I will take it. I'll wait until Dr Fauci says its okay to take it. (See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUiDLcp_hIw">here</a> for a nice song about Dr. Fauci.)</p><p>8) Some people who thought it was a Hoax and then got a bad case of it are saying loudly `I WAS WRONG! Its Real!'  I wonder if Herman Cain realized it was real before he died of it? I wish he had said `I WAS WRONG! ITS REAL! Wear a MASK' (The Whitehouse denies that he got Covid from the Tulsa Rally, here is headline only since something is behind paywalls: <a href="https://tulsaworld.com/news/local/white-house-denies-herman-cain-contracted-covid-19-at-tulsa-trump-rally-prior-to-his/article_b0c83d3c-c3de-547e-9a5f-434b6a82ac61.html">here</a>)</p><p>9) At Tulsa the presidents people took DOWN signs about safe distancing. So again, why does the Prez want to kill his own base? I ask non rhetorically. I am serious- I want someone to defend his actions intelligently both this one and the hydro-whatever in the first point.</p><p>10) Authoritarian governments often claim that they bring order and can act fast to get things done. So they SHOULD have an advantage during the pandemic since they can more easily ORDER a lockdown. Yet they don't seem to be doing better.  </p><p>Russia: <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/russia/">See Here</a>, number of cases going up fast.</p><p>Iran: <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/iran/">See here</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-53598965">Here</a>, number of cases going up fast.</p><p>These countries and others, and America, had their leaders LIE about the extend of the virus early on. What is the upside of doing this?  I ask non-rhetorically. </p><p><br /></p></div>

We study parity decision trees for Boolean functions. The motivation of our study is the log-rank conjecture for XOR functions and its connection to Fourier analysis and parity decision tree complexity. Our contributions are as follows. Let $f : \mathbb{F}_2^n \to \{-1, 1\}$ be a Boolean function with Fourier support $\mathcal{S}$ and Fourier sparsity $k$.

1) We prove via the probabilistic method that there exists a parity decision tree of depth $O(\sqrt{k})$ that computes $f$. This matches the best known upper bound on the parity decision tree complexity of Boolean functions (Tsang, Wong, Xie, and Zhang, FOCS 2013). Moreover, while previous constructions (Tsang et al., FOCS 2013, Shpilka, Tal, and Volk, Comput. Complex. 2017) build the trees by carefully choosing the parities to be queried in each step, our proof shows that a naive sampling of the parities suffices.

2) We generalize the above result by showing that if the Fourier spectra of Boolean functions satisfy a natural "folding property", then the above proof can be adapted to establish existence of a tree of complexity polynomially smaller than $O(\sqrt k)$. More concretely, the folding property we consider is that for most distinct $\gamma, \delta$ in $\mathcal{S}$, there are at least a polynomial (in $k$) number of pairs $(\alpha, \beta)$ of parities in $\mathcal{S}$ such that $\alpha+\beta=\gamma+\delta$. We make a conjecture in this regard which, if true, implies that the communication complexity of an XOR function is bounded above by the fourth root of the rank of its communication matrix, improving upon the previously known upper bound of square root of rank (Tsang et al., FOCS 2013, Lovett, J. ACM. 2016).

3) Motivated by the above, we present some structural results about the Fourier spectra of Boolean functions. It can be shown by elementary techniques that for any Boolean function $f$ and all $(\alpha, \beta)$ in ${\mathcal{S} \choose 2}$, there exists another pair $(\gamma, \delta)$ in ${\mathcal{S} \choose 2}$ such that $\alpha + \beta = \gamma + \delta$. One can view this as a "trivial" folding property that all Boolean functions satisfy. Prior to our work, it was conceivable that for all $(\alpha, \beta) \in {\mathcal{S} \choose 2}$, there exists exactly one other pair $(\gamma, \delta) \in {\mathcal{S} \choose 2}$ with $\alpha + \beta = \gamma + \delta$. We show, among other results, that there must exist several $\gamma \in \mathbb{F}_2^n$ such that there are at least three pairs of parities $(\alpha_1, \alpha_2) \in {\mathcal{S} \choose 2}$ with $\alpha_1+\alpha_2=\gamma$. This, in particular, rules out the possibility stated earlier.</div>

<ol><li>Good news, everyone!  Following years of requests, this blog finally supports rich HTML and basic TeX in comments.  Also, the German spam that used to plague the blog (when JavaScript was disabled) is gone.  For all this, I owe deep gratitude to a reader and volunteer named <a href="https://filiparena.github.io/">Filip Dimitrovski</a>.<br /></li><li>Filip refused to accept any payment for fixing this blog.  Instead, he asked only one favor: namely, that I use my platform to raise public awareness about the plight of the MAOI antidepressant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenelzine">Nardil</a>.  Filip tells me that, while tens of thousands of people desperately need Nardil—no other antidepressant ever worked for them—it’s become increasingly unavailable because the pharma companies can no longer make money on it.  He points me to a <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/30/prescriptions-paradoxes-and-perversities/">SlateStarCodex post from 2015</a> that explains the problem in more detail (anyone else miss SlateStarCodex?).

Frances Allen was one of the leaders who helped create the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compilers</a> research. Fran was an elite researcher at IBM, and won a Turing Award for this pioneering work. Allen also collected other awards. </p>

<p>Perhaps the coolest award is one that Fran could never win: The <a href="https://www.ieee.org/about/awards/medals/frances-e-allen-medal.html">Frances E. Allen</a> award created this year by the IEEE: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>For innovative work in computing leading to lasting impact on other fields of engineering, technology, or science.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Today we will talk about Fran, who sadly just passed away.</p>
<p>
I consider Fran a friend, although we never worked together—our areas of interest were different. One fond memory of mine is being on panel a while ago with Fran. What a delightful presence.</p>
<p>
Fran always seemed to be smiling, always with that smile. The following images come in large part from interviews and lectures and award events-the fact that it is so easy to find them is a testament to her public engagement as well as scientific contributions.</p>

<p></p><h2> Compliers were Key </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
There was a time when compliers were the most important program available on any new computer. Perhaps on any computer. Here is proof: </p>
<ol>
<li>
Computers are there to solve problems. <p></p>
</li><li>
We must write programs to solve problems. <p></p>
</li><li>
Details of the computer and instructions, are complicated, which make writing programs hard. <p></p>
</li><li>
Thus, automating the writing of programs is important. <p></p>
</li><li>
QED: we must have compliers.
</li></ol>
<p>
Okay this is not really a “proof”, but there is some truth to the argument. Fran was at IBM and worked on some of the early compliers, including FORTRAN and related languages. IBM wanted to sell computers, well actually in the early days rent them. One potential roadblock, IBM realized, was that new computers could be hard to program. Thus to ensure that companies rented new machines as fast as IBM could manufacture them was important. This created the need for compliers and even more for <i>optimizing compilers</i>.</p>
<p>
In order to ship more machines, the code that a complier created had to be efficient. Hence, a stress on Allen was to figure out how compliers could generate high quality code. This led Fran and others like John Cocke to discover many complier techniques that are still used today. A short list of the ideas is: </p>
<ul>
<li>
Branch prediction <p></p>
</li><li>
Register allocation <p></p>
</li><li>
Control flow graphs <p></p>
</li><li>
Program dependence graphs <p></p>
</li><li>
And many more.
</li></ul>
<p>
What is so important is that Allen’s work was not just applicable to this machine or that language. Rather the work was able to be used for almost any machine and for almost any language. This universal nature of the work on compliers reminds me of what we try to do in theory. Allen’s research was so important because it could be used for future hardware as well as future languages. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Register Allocation </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Guy Steele interviewed Allen for the ACM <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/1/103191-an-interview-with-frances-e-allen/fulltext">here</a>. During the interview Fran talked about register allocation:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> I have a story about register allocation. FORTRAN back in the 1950’s had the beginnings of a theory of register allocation, even though there were only three registers on the target machine. Quite a bit later, John Backus became interested in applying graph coloring to allocating registers; he worked for about 10 years on that problem and just couldn’t solve it. I considered it the biggest outstanding problem in optimizing compilers for a long time. Optimizing transformations would produce code with symbolic registers; the issue was then to map symbolic registers to real machine registers, of which there was a limited set. For high-performance computing, register allocation often conflicts with instruction scheduling. There wasn’t a good algorithm until the Chaitin algorithm. Chaitin was working on the PL compiler for the 801 system. Ashok Chandra, another student of Knuth’s, joined the department and told about how he had worked on the graph coloring problem, which Knuth had given out in class, and had solved it not by solving the coloring problem directly, but in terms of what is the minimal number of colors needed to color the graph. Greg immediately recognized that he could apply this solution to the register allocator issue. It was a wonderful kind of serendipity. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Compliers Create Theory </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The early goal of creating compliers lead directly to some wonderful theory problems. One whole area that dominated early theory research was language theory. In particular understanding questions that arise in defining programming languages. Syntax came first—later semantics was formalized.</p>
<p>
Noam Chomsky created context-free grammars to help understand natural languages in the 1950s. His ideas were used by John Backus, also a Turing award winner from IBM, to describe the then new programming language IAL. This is known today as ALGOL 58, which became ALGOL 60. Peter Naur on the ALGOL 60 committee called Backus’s notation for ALGOL’s syntax: Backus normal form, but is now called BNF-Backus-Naur form. </p>

<p>
Theorists worked on, I confess I did, many questions about such languages. Existence problems, decidability problems, efficient algorithms, and closure properties were just some of the examples. Not clear how much of this theory effected compiler design, but I would like to think that some was useful. Theorist should thank the complier researchers. I do. </p>
<p>
For instance the 1970 STOC <a href="https://dblp.org/db/conf/stoc/stoc70">program</a> had many papers on language related topics—here are some:</p>
<ul>
<li>
A Result on the Relationship between Simple Precedence Languages and Reducing Transition Languages. 		Gary Lindstrom <p></p>
</li><li>
The Design of Parsers for Incremental Language Processors: 		Ronald Book, Sheila Greibach, Ben Wegbreit <p></p>
</li><li>
Tape- and Time-Bounded Turing Acceptors and AFLs. 		David Lewis <p></p>
</li><li>
Closure of Families of Languages under Substitution Operators. 		William Rounds <p></p>
</li><li>
Tree-Oriented Proofs of Some Theorems on Context-Free and Indexed Languages. 		Barry Rosen <p></p>
</li><li>
On Syntax-Directed Transduction and Tree Transducers. 		Alfred Aho, Jeffrey Ullman <p></p>
</li><li>
The Analysis of Two-Dimensional Patterns using Picture Processing Grammars. 		Jean-Francois Perrot <p></p>
</li><li>
On Some Families of Languages Related to the Dyck Language. 		Joseph Ullian <p></p>
</li><li>
Three Theorems on Abstract Families of Languages. 	Joseph Ullian
</li></ul>
<p>
By the way Abstract Families of Languages or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_family_of_languages">AFL</a>s was created by Seymour Ginsburg and Sheila Greibach in 1967 as a way to generalize context free languages. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Fran was asked by Steele in that <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/1/103191-an-interview-with-frances-e-allen/fulltext">interview</a>: <i>Any advice for the future?</i></p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Yes, I do have one thing. Students aren’t joining our field, computer science, and I don’t know why. It’s just such an amazing field, and it’s changed the world, and we’re just at the beginning of the change. We have to find a way to get our excitement out to be more publicly visible. It is exciting, in the 50 years that I’ve been involved, the change has been astounding. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Thanks Fran. Much of that change is due to pioneers like you. Thanks for everything.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>I spent the last few days participating in the <a href="http://vga.usask.ca/cccg2020/">Canadian Conference in Computational Geometry</a>, originally planned for Saskatoon but organized virtually instead.</p>

<p>The way the conference was organized was that (after the usual submission reviewing process) the accepted authors provided both a proceedings paper and a 10-15 minute talk video to the conference organizers. Participants were required to register, but with no registration fee, and were provided with links to the papers and talks (which are all still live on the conference program). Then, during the conference itself, live online Zoom sessions ran for only 2-3 hours daily, scheduled for 10AM-1PM Saskatoon time: very convenient for anywhere in North America or Europe, not so much for the participants in Iran, India, China, Japan, and Korea (all of which did have participants). The sessions included a daily 1-hour live invited talk, and question-and-answer sessions for the contributed works, in which we were shown a one-minute teaser for each video and then invited to ask questions of authors, at least one of whom was required to be present.</p>

<p>I think it all worked very well; so well, in fact, that during the business meeting there were calls for having at least some of the content similarly online so that people could participate remotely again. The ability to ask and answer questions either by live video on Zoom or through Zoom chat was useful, and used. Attendance was far above previous levels: 162 registrants, and over 120 unique participants at the most heavily attended of the two daily parallel sessions, compared to roughly 60 attendees each at the last two physical conferences. Despite the free registration, the conference organization was not without cost: they spent roughly $1500 (Canadian) in video production costs and video conferencing fees, but this was more than made up for by institutional support for the conference, so they ended up running a surplus which may (if it can be kept) end up providing some float for future conference organizers.</p>

<p>There are two changes I would suggest for future events of this type:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The contributed sessions were for a short enough time that holding them in parallel seemed unnecessary, and made it impossible to participate in all discussions. So this format may work better with less parallelism.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The one-minute teaser videos were cut together by the conference organizers from the longer videos provided by the authors, but in some cases the pacing of the longer videos from which they were cut meant that these teaser videos could not clearly state the results of their papers. I think it would have been better to ask authors to provide these alongside the longer talk videos.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the highlights of the event:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Wednesday’s invited talk by Erik Demaine was a moving tribute to Godfried Toussaint and a survey of some of both Toussaint’s research, and Erik’s research on problems started by Toussaint, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Nagy_theorem">convexifying polygons by flips</a>, sona curves (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15784">the subject of one of my own contributions</a>), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Geometry_of_Musical_Rhythm">geometry of musical rhythms</a>, and perhaps most importantly “supercollaboration”, the model of shared research and shared authorship developed by Toussaint at the Barbados research workshops and also used by Erik within many of his MIT classes. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exzxGODi2YU">Erik’s talk was recorded and is now on YouTube</a>; I hope the same will be true of the other two invited talks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Wednesday’s contributed session on unfolding (in which I had two papers) I particularly liked Satyan Devadoss’s talk, “Nets of higher-dimensional cubes”. The main result is that if you unfold a hypercube, then no path of facets of the unfolded shape can contain a u-turn: if the path takes a step in one any coordinate direction, it cannot step in the opposite direction. This implies that all dual spanning trees unfold flat without self-intersection. The same property was known for all the Platonic solids, and Satyan can prove it for regular simplices in any dimension, but that still leaves several regular polytopes for which it is still open whether all unfoldings work: the cross-polytopes in all dimensions, and the three exceptional regular polytopes in four dimensions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thursday’s invited talk was by Jeff Erickson, “Chasing puppies”. It was an entertaining presentation of an elegant topological proof of the following result: if you and a puppy can both move around a simple closed curve in the plane, with the puppy always moving along the curve to a local minimum of distance to you, then you can always find a path to follow that will bring you and the puppy to the same point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There wasn’t an official prize for best contributed presentation, but in the data structures session on Thursday, several comments nominated <a href="https://medium.com/photos-we-love/the-trinity-of-incongruity-or-why-i-still-love-this-tuxedo-sewing-machine-ups-truck-photograph-39712dd32fcb">Don Sheehy</a> as the unofficial winner, for a video artfully mixing live action with computer animations. His paper, “One-hop greedy permutations” concerned heuristics for improving the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farthest-first_traversal">farthest-first traversal</a> of a set of points by looking near each point as the sequence is constructed for a better point to use instead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was an official best student paper award, and it went to <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/afloresv">Alejandro Flores Velazco</a> for his paper “Social distancing is good for points too!” It concerns the problem of reducing the size of a data set while preserving the quality of nearest-neighbor classification using the reduced set. It proves that FCNN, which it calls the most popular heuristic for this problem, can produce significantly less-reduced outputs than some other proven heuristics, and shows how to modify FCNN to get a heuristic with guaranteed output quality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third of the invited sessions was by Yusu Wang, newly moved from Ohio State to UC San Diego. She gave a nice introduction to combinatorial methods for reconstructing road networks (or other networks embedded into higher-dimensional geometry) from noisy samples of points on the network by combining discrete Morse theory to find the ridge lines of sample density with persistent homology to clean some of the noise from the data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final technical component of the conference was an open problem session, also recorded and presumably to be uploaded at some point. Satyan posed his question on regular polytope unfolding there. Mike Paterson asked whether one can construct “Plato’s torus”, an embedded torus with six equilateral-triangle faces meeting at each vertex; <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2009/02/03/flat-equilateral-tori.html">in a blog post I made on this problem in 2009 I traced its history to Nick Halloway in 1997</a> but Mike says he discussed it already with Christopher Zeeman in the 1970s. Another problem that caught my attention asked for an algorithmic version of the polyhedral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem_of_the_three_geodesics">theorem of the three geodesics</a>, the existence of a path across the surface of a convex polyhedron that stays straight across each edge or face of the polyhedron, and has at most \(\pi\) surface angle on each side of it when it passes through a vertex. Again there’s some history here: Joe O’Rourke says he once mentioned the problem to Gromov, who said it was easy but unfortunately didn’t elaborate.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>CCCG 2021 is planned for Halifax, colocated with WADS. One somewhat controversial issue is that the current plan is to have both conferences overlap for two days, with one overlap-free day for each conference at each end of the overlap period. But if both conferences are double-session, this means that participants can only choose one of four overlapping talks. At this point everyone is still hoping that events allow for a physical conference by then but that remains to be seen.</p>

Even so:  I plan to vote for Joe Biden.<div><br /></div><div>(Lance says that whenever I write `this is a non-partisan post'  its partisan anyway.)</div><div><br /></div><div>I've had posts on predicting VPs before:</div><div><br /></div><div>In <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/02/using-who-will-be-dem-vp-choice-article.html">this post</a> I looked at a Nate Silver column a few months ago where they were trying to predict the democratic VP nomination <i>before the Prez nominee was know</i>n. Some of what they said seems relevant.</div><div><br /></div><div>In <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2008/09/i-would-be-on-intrade-that-intrade-will.html">this post</a> I PREDICTED that bets on INTRADE would not do well on picking VPs since VP picks are hard to predict and often are not from anyone's short list. I DID NOT PREDICT that INTRADE would go out of business.</div><div><br /></div><div>I came across a statistic recently that seems relevant and inspired this post. Actually this post asks IS this statistic relevant?</div><div><br /></div><div>From Prez candidate  Harry Truman to Prez candidate Hillary Clinton there have been 15 Dem VP nominees (not  counting incumbents) of which 13 have been Senators:</div><div><br /></div><div>Harry Truman(Prez)-Alben Barkely. Sen from Kentucky</div><div>Adlai Stevenson(Gov-Illinois) -John Sparkman. Sen from Alabama</div><div>Adlai Stevenson(Gov-Illinois)-Estes Kefauver, Sen from Tennessee </div><div>John F Kennedy(Sen-Mass)-Lyndon B Johnson, Sen from Texas</div><div>Lyndon B Johnson(Prez)-Hubert Humphrey,Sen from Minnesoda</div><div>Hubert Humphrey(VP)-Ed Muskie, Sen from Maine</div><div>George McGovern Sen-South Dakota)-Sgt Shriver Amb to France, Office of Econ Activity</div><div>Jimmy Carter(Gov Georgia)-Walter Mondale- Senator from Minnesota</div><div>Walter Mondale(Senator Minnesota)-Geraldine Ferraro Congressperson- NY</div><div>Mike Dukakis (Gov Mass), Lloyd Benson-Sen Texas</div><div>Bill Clinton(Gov Arkansas), Al Gore Sen from Tennesee</div><div>Al Gore (VP), Joe Lieberman Senator from Conn</div><div>John Kerry (Sen-Mass), John Edwards Sen from NC</div><div>Barack Obama (Sen-Illinois), Joe Biden Sen from Del</div><div>Hillary Clinton (Sen-NY), Tim Kaine- Sen Virginia</div><div><br /></div><div>Of the 15 Dem VP nominees, 13 are Senators</div><div><br /></div><div>Of the 13 Rep VP nominees, 4 are Senators  <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/rebvp.txt">see here</a></div><div><br /></div><div>My Speculations: </div><div><br /></div><div>1)  When a gov runs he wants someone with fed experience. That explains 5 of the cases above.</div><div><br /></div><div>2) Senators tend to be better known than other politicians, so perhaps being well known is what you need. Note on the Republican Side Paul Ryan was a House member but was well known.</div><div><br /></div><div>3) Why do the Reps and Dems differ on this? Is the sample size too small to make this question interesting? </div><div><br /></div><div>So here is the question: When trying to predict who the Dem VP will be (this year or any year) should being a Senator give someone a plus? A higher weight in a Neural Net? </div><div><br /></div><div>Kamala Harris is the favorite on the betting markets.  Is this because she is a Senator?</div><div><br /></div><div>She has a national profile and has already been vetted since she rana serious campaign  for Prez in the primaries. So I would say that THATS the reason (and other reasons), not that she is a Senator. But would she have been able to run a serious campaign  in the primaries if she wasn't already a Senator? I ask non rhetorically.</div><div><br /></div><div>ADDED LATER- one of the comments inspired me to also include who the Republicans picked for VP since Truman. Much more variety in the jobs they held prior. This is neither good or bad.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><div><br /></div><div>Thomas Dewey (Gov-NY), Earl Warren (Gov-California)</div><div><br /></div><div>Dwight Eisenhower (General), Richard Nixon (Sen-California)</div><div><br /></div><div>Richard Nixon (VP), Henry Cabot Lodge (Sen-Mass, Amb-UN)</div><div><br /></div><div>Barry Goldwater (Sen-Arizona), William Miller (Representive-NY)</div><div><br /></div><div>Richard Nixon (VP), Spiro Agnew (Gov-MD)</div><div><br /></div><div>Gerald Ford (Prez, Senator-Michigan), Bob Dole (Senator-Kansas)</div><div><br /></div><div>Ronald Reagan (Gov California), George Bush (Dir of CIA)</div><div><br /></div><div>George Bush (VP), Dan Quayle (Sen-Indiana)</div><div><br /></div><div>Bob Dole (Sen-Kansas), Jack Kemp (Representiative-NY)</div><div><br /></div><div>George W Bush (Gov-Texas), Dick Cheney (Cabinet)</div><div><br /></div><div>John McCain (Sen-Arizona), Sarah Palin (Gov-Alaska)</div><div><br /></div><div>Mitt Romney (Gov-Mass), Paul Ryan (Represenative-NY)</div><div><br /></div><div>Donald Trump (Businessman-NY), Mike Pence (Gov-Indiana)</div></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

<p>The 4th <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~mahabadi/workshops/WOLA-2020.html">Workshop on Local Algorithms (WoLA 2020)</a> recently concluded: aimed at <em>“fostering dialogue and cross-pollination of ideas between the various communities</em>” related to local algorithms, broadly construed, it featured invited and contributed talks on a variety of topics, many (if not most) very relevant to the sublinear algorithms and property testing community.</p>



<p>Because of the online format of the workshop (imposed by the current circumstances), all talks were recorded and posted online. As such, all videos all available on the workshop’s <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~mahabadi/workshops/WOLA-2020.html">website</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMBSZ3q2FKJntpcK72h9eeA/videos">YouTube channel</a>: a good list of resources to peruse!</p></div>
