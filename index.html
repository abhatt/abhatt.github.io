<p>The first Foundations of Data Science virtual talk will take place this coming Friday, February 28th at 11:00 AM Pacific Time (2:00 pm Eastern Time, 20:00 Central European Time, 19:00 UTC). <strong>Jon Kleinberg</strong> from Cornell University will speak about “<em>Fairness and Bias in Algorithmic Decision-Making</em>”.</p>



<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: As data science has broadened its scope in recent years, a number of domains have applied computational methods for classification and prediction to evaluate individuals in high-stakes settings. These developments have led to an active line of recent discussion in the public sphere about the consequences of algorithmic prediction for notions of fairness and equity. In part, this discussion has involved a basic tension between competing notions of what it means for such classifications to be fair to different groups. We consider several of the key fairness conditions that lie at the heart of these debates, and in particular how these properties operate when the goal is to rank-order a set of applicants by some criterion of interest, and then to select the top-ranking applicants. The talk will be based on joint work with Sendhil Mullainathan and Manish Raghavan.</p>

<p class="justify-text">I don’t know of any user of iterative algorithms who has not complained one day about their convergence speed. Whether the data are too big, the processors not fast or numerous enough, waiting for an algorithm to converge unfortunately remains a core practical component of computer science and applied mathematics. This was already a concern long before computers were invented (and most of the techniques I will describe date back to the early 19th century): imagine you are doing all the operations (multiplications, additions, divisions) by hand, wouldn’t you want some cheap way to accelerate your algorithm (and here literally reduce your pain)?</p>



<p class="justify-text">Acceleration is a key concept in numerical analysis and can be carried through in two main ways. The first way is to modify some steps of the algorithm (such as Nesterov acceleration for gradient descent, or <a href="https://francisbach.com/chebyshev-polynomials/">Chebyshev</a> / <a href="https://francisbach.com/jacobi-polynomials/">Jacobi</a> acceleration for linear recursions). This requires a good knowledge of the inner structure of the underlying algorithm. A second way is to totally ignore the specifics of the algorithm, and see the acceleration problem as trying to find good “combinations” of the observed iterates that converge faster.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I thus consider a sequence of iterates \((x_k)_{k \geq 0}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) obtained from an iterative algorithm \(x_{k+1} = T(x_k)\), which will typically be an optimization algorithm. The main question I will address is: Can we do better than outputting the last iterate?</p>



<p class="justify-text">This has a long history in numerical analysis, where many techniques have been developed for uni-dimensional sequences. Acceleration techniques vary according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_convergence">type of convergence</a> of the original sequence (quadratic, linear, sublinear), the amount of knowledge about the asymptotic behavior, and the possibility of extensions to high-dimensional and noisy problems.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Acceleration techniques are often based on an explicit or implicit modelling of the sequence \(x_k\), either through a model of the function \(T: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d\) (the iteration of the algorithm) or through an asymptotic expansion of \(x_k\). In this post, I will focus on linearly convergent sequences, that is, sequences \(x_k\) converging to some \(x_\ast\) at an exponential rate. As we will see, this will done through modelling \(x_k\) as an autoregressive process.</p>



<p class="justify-text">I will first start from the simplest scheme, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitken%27s_delta-squared_process">Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\) process</a> from 1926 [1], then look at higher order generalizations still in one dimension, and finally to the general vector case. We will then apply all that to gradient descent.</p>



<h2>Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\) process</h2>



<p class="justify-text">This is the simplest of all techniques and the source of all others in this post. We try to model \(x_k\in \mathbb{R}\) as first-order auto-regressive sequence, that is, \(x_{k+1} = ax_{k}+b\), for \(a,b \in \mathbb{R}\). The method works by (a) estimating \(a\) and \(b\) from a sequence of few consecutive (here three) iterates, and (b) extrapolating by computing the limit \(x_{\rm acc}\) of the estimated model. Given that we fit the model to consecutive iterates \((x_k,x_{k+1},x_{k+2})\), the model \((a,b)\) will also depend on \(k\), as well as its limit \(x_{\rm acc}\). In order to avoid having too many \(k\)’s in my notations, I will drop the dependence in \(k\) of the model parameters.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this situation, the model recursion has a limit when \(a \neq 1\), and the limit is \(x_{\rm acc} =  \frac{b}{1-a}\). In order to fit the two parameters, we need two equations, which can be obtained by considering two consecutive evaluations of the recursions (which require three iterates). That is, we consider the linear system in \((a,b)\): $$ \Big\{ \begin{array}{ll} ax_{k}+b  &amp; = x_{k+1} \\    ax_{k+1}+b &amp; = x_{k+2} \end{array}$$ which can be solved in a variety of ways. All of them are equivalent, but naturally lead to different extensions.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Solving by elimination.</strong> We can eliminate \(b\) by subtracting the two equations, leading to $$ x_{k+2}  – x_{k+1} = a ( x_{k+1} – x_{k}),$$  and thus $$a = \frac{ x_{k+2}  – x_{k+1}}{ x_{k+1} – x_{k}}.$$ We then get $$b = x_{k+1} – a x_{k} = x_{k+1} –  \frac{ x_{k+2}  – x_{k+1}}{ x_{k+1} – x_{k}} x_{k} =  \frac{  x_{k+1}^2 – x_{k} x_{k+2}}{ x_{k+1} – x_{k}}, $$ and the extrapolating sequence $$x_{\rm acc} = \frac{b}{1-a} = \frac{x_{k} x_{k+2} – x_{k+1}^2 }{-2 x_{k+1} + x_{k+2} + x_{k}},$$ which we denote \(x^{(1)}_k\), to highlight its dependence on \(k\). Note that to compute \(x^{(1)}_k\), we need access to the three iterates \((x_k,x_{k+1},x_{k+2})\), and thus, when comparing the original sequence to the extrapolated one, we will compare \(x_k\) and \(x^{(1)}_{k-2}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Asymptotic auto-regressive model</strong>. A key feature of the acceleration techniques that I describe in this post is that although they implicitly or explicitly model sequence with auto-regressive processes, the models do not need to be correct, that is, they also work if the autoregressive recursion is true only asymptotically, for example \(\displaystyle \frac{x_{k+1}-x_\ast}{x_k – x_\ast}\) converging to a constant \(a \in [-1,1)\). Then we also get some acceleration, which can be quantified (see the end of the post for details), and for which we present a classical example below.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Approximating \(\pi\).</strong> We consider the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80">Leibniz formula</a>, which is one of many ways of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximations_of_%CF%80">approximating \(\pi\)</a>: $$ \pi = \lim_{k \to +\infty} x_k  \mbox{ with } x_k = 4 \sum_{k=0}^{+\infty} \frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}.$$ This formula can be proved by expanding the derivative \(x \mapsto \frac{1}{1+x^2}\) of \(x \mapsto \arctan x\) as a power series and then integrating it. We can check that $$\frac{x_{k+1}-x_\ast}{x_k – x_\ast} =  \ – 1 + \frac{1}{k} + o( \frac{1}{k}), $$ and as detailed at the end of the post, we should expect the error to go from \(1/k\) to \(1/k^3\).  Below, we show the first 10 iterates of the two sequences, with the correct significant digits in bold. $$ \begin{array}{|l|l|l|} \hline k &amp; x_k &amp;  x_k^{(1)} \\ \hline  1  &amp;   4.0000   &amp;  \times \\      2  &amp;  2.6667     &amp;    \times \\  3  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.4667   &amp; \mathbf{3.1}667 \\   4 &amp;   2.8952  &amp;  \mathbf{3.1}333 \\     5  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.3397  &amp;  \mathbf{3.14}52 \\  6 &amp;   2.9760 &amp;   \mathbf{3.1}397 \\   7  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.2837  &amp;  \mathbf{3.14}27 \\   8  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.0171  &amp;  \mathbf{3.14}09 \\  9  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.2524  &amp;  \mathbf{3.14}21 \\   10  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.0418 &amp;  \mathbf{3.141}3 \\ \hline \end{array}$$ We see that the extrapolated sequence converges much faster. This is confirmed in the convergence plot below:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="335" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/deltasquared.png" class="wp-image-2148" height="283" />\(\Delta^2\) method on the Leibniz series.  Notice the improvement from \(O(1/k)\) to \(O(1/k^3)\).</figure></div>



<h2>Higher-order one-dimensional extensions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\) process relies on fitting a first-order auto-regressive model, or on assuming that \(x_{k+1} – x_\ast – a (x_k – x_\ast) \to 0\) asymptotically. This can be extended to \(m\)-th order constant recursions. This corresponds to modelling \(x_k\) as the sum of \(m\) exponentials.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We thus try to fit the model $$x_{k+m} = a_0 x_k + a_1 x_{k+1} + \cdots + a_{m-1} x_{k+m-1} + b = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} a_i x_{k+i} + b, $$ which has \(m+1\) parameters. We thus need \(m + 1\) equations, that is we consider the recursion for \(k, k+1,\dots, k+m\), which requires the knowledge of the \(2m+1\) iterates \(x_k, x_{k+1},\dots,x_{k+2m}\). This leads to the \(m+1\) equations: $$x_{k+m+j} = a_0 x_{k+j} + a_1 x_{k+j+1} + \cdots + a_{m-1} x_{k+j+m-1} + b = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} a_i x_{k+j+i} + b,$$ for \(j \in \{0,\dots,m\}\). This is a system with \(m+1\) unknowns and \(m+1\) equations, from which we could get all \(a_j\)’s and \(b\), and then the model limit as the extrapolated sequence \(x^{(m)}_k = \frac{b}{1 – a_0 – a_1 – \cdots – a_{m-1}}\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">This linear system can be solved in a variety of ways. At the end of the blog post, I show how it can be solved using determinants of Hankel-like matrices, often referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanks_transformation">Shanks transformation</a>, which then leads to an iterative algorithm dating back from Wynn [2], which is called the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon_algorithme">\(\varepsilon\)-algorithm</a>. In order to smooth our way to the vector case extension, I will present it in a slightly non-standard way. See [3] for a detailed survey on acceleration and extrapolation.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Instead of learning the model parameters to estimate \(x_{k+m}\) from the past iterates, we focus directly on the prediction of the limit \(x_{\rm acc}\) by looking for real numbers \(c_0,\dots,c_m\) such that for all \(k\), $$\sum_{i=0}^m c_i ( x_{k+i} – x_{\rm acc} ) = 0,$$ with the arbitrary normalization \(\sum_{i=0}^m c_i = 1\). The \(c_i\)’s can be obtained from the \(a_i\)’s and \(b\) as \((c_0,c_1,\dots,c_{m-1},c_m)\propto (a_0,a_1,\dots,a_{m-1},-1)\). We then have $$x_{\rm acc} = \sum_{i=0}^m c_{i} x_{k+i}.$$ Again, the parameters \(c_i\)’s depend on \(k\), but we omit this dependence.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to estimate the \(m+1\) parameters \(c_0,\dots,c_m\), we subtract two versions of the equality for \(k\) and \(k+1\), leading to $$\sum_{i=0}^m c_i ( x_{k+1+i} – x_{k+i} ) = 0.$$ Defining the matrix \(U \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times (m+1)}\) by $$U_{ji} = x_{k+1+i+j} – x_{k+i+j},$$ for \(i \in \{0,\dots,m\}\) and \(j \in \{0,\dots,m-1\}\), we have $$ U c = 0. $$ Together with the constraint \(1_{m+1}^\top c = 1\), this leads to the correct number of equations to estimate \(c\), from \(2m+1\) iterates \(x_k,\dots,x_{k+2m}\). The extrapolated iterate \(x^{(m)}_k\) is then $$x^{(m)}_k = x_{\rm acc} =   \sum_{i=0}^m c_{i} x_{k+i}.$$ Note that the extrapolation is exact when the sequence is exactly following a \(m\)-th order recursion. See an example of application on the Leibniz formula below.</p>

Acceleration is possible only up to machine precision.</figure></div>



<h2>Extension to vectors</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now consider accelerating vector sequences \(x_k \in \mathbb{R}^d\). There are multiple approaches to extend acceleration from real numbers to vectors, as presented in [4, 5]. The simplest way is to apply high-order extrapolation to all coordinates separately (which is often called the vector \(\varepsilon\)-algorithm [10]); this depends however a lot on the chosen basis, requires too many linear systems to solve, and performs worse (see examples below for gradient descent). We now present a vector extension which exists under many names: the Eddy-Mesina method [6,7], reduced rank extrapolation [4, 11, 12], or Anderson acceleration [8]. </p>



<p class="justify-text">We want to model the sequence \(x_k \in \mathbb{R}^d\) as $$x_{k+1} = A x_{k} + b,$$ where \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}\) and \(b \in \mathbb{R}^d\). By a simple variable / equation counting arguments, there are \(d^2+d\) parameters, and we thus need \(d+1\) equations in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), and thus \(d+2\) consecutive iterates, to estimate \(A\) and \(b\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to use only \(m+2\) iterates, with \(m \) much less than \(d\), we will focus directly on the extrapolation equation $$x_{\rm acc} = c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1}+  \cdots +c_m x_{k+m}, $$ with the constraint that \(c_0+c_1+\cdots+c_m =1\). Therefore, we will not try to explicitly fit the model parameters \(A\) and \(b\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">A sufficient condition for good extrapolation weights is that the extrapolated version is close for two consecutive \(k\)’s, that is $$c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1}+  \cdots +c_m x_{k+m} \approx c_0 x_{k+1} + c_1 x_{k+2}+  \cdots +c_m x_{k+m+1},$$ which can be rewritten as $$c_0 (x_{k}-x_{k+1}) + c_1 ( x_{k+1} -x_{k+2}) + \cdots + c_m (x_{k+m} – x_{k+m+1}) \approx 0.$$ A natural criterion is thus to minimize the \(\ell_2\)-norm $$ \big\| c_0 \Delta x_{k} + c_1  \Delta x_{k+1} + \cdots + c_m \Delta x_{k+m} \big\|_2 \mbox{ such that } c_0+c_1+\cdots+c_m = 1,$$ where \(\Delta x_{i} = x_{i} -x_{i+1}\). Denoting \(U \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times (m+1)}\) the matrix with columns \(\Delta x_{k}, \dots,  \Delta x_{k+m}\), we need to minimize \(\| U c \|_2\) such that \(c^\top 1_{m+1} = 1\), whose solution is $$ c \propto ( U^\top U)^{-1} 1_{m+1}, \mbox{ that is, } c = \frac{1}{1_{m+1}^\top (U^\top U)^{-1} 1_{m+1}}  ( U^\top U)^{-1} 1_{m+1}.$$ Note that while the weights \(c_0,\dots,c_m\) sum to one, they may be negative, that is, the extrapolated sequence is not always a convex combination (hence the name extrapolation). Moreover, note that unless \(m\) is large enough, the optimal \(U c\) is in general not equal to zero (it is when modelling real sequences, see below).</p>



<p class="justify-text">For \(m=1\), the solution is particularly simple, as we need to minimize $$ \|\Delta x_{k+1}  – c_0 ( \Delta x_{k+1} – \Delta x_k ) \|^2,$$ leading to $$c_0 = \frac{\Delta x_{k+1}^\top ( \Delta x_{k+1} – \Delta x_k )}{ \|  \Delta x_{k+1} – \Delta x_k \|^2} \mbox{ and } c_1 = \frac{\Delta x_{k}^\top ( \Delta x_{k} – \Delta x_{k+1} )}{ \|  \Delta x_{k+1} – \Delta x_k \|^2}.$$ The acute reader can check that when \(d=1\), we recover Aitken’s formula. See an example in two dimensions below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img width="380" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/anderson_2d.gif" class="wp-image-2276" height="319" />Anderson acceleration in two dimensions. The sequence is following an auto-regressive process with a symmetric \(A\) with eigenvalues in \((-1,1)\). Anderson acceleration cancels the oscillation due to the eigenvalue with largest magnitude.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Recovering one-dimensional sequence acceleration.</strong> Given a real sequence \(y_k \in \mathbb{R}\), we can define the vector \(x_k\) in \(\mathbb{R}^m\) as $$x_k = \left( \begin{array}{c} y_k \\  y_{k+1} \\ \vdots \\ y_{k+m-1} \end{array} \right).$$ One can then check that the matrix \(U\) defined for this vector sequence is exactly the same as the matrix \(U\) defined earlier for the real valued sequence. The optimal \(\| Uc \|\) is then equal to zero (which is not the case in general).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>When is it exact?</strong> The derivation I followed is only intuitive, and as for the other acceleration mechanisms, a natural question is: when is it exact? We will consider linear recursions.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Analysis for linear recursions.</strong> Assuming that \(x_{k+1} = A x_{k} + b\) is exact for all \(k \geq 0\), then \(x_k – x_\ast = A^{k} ( x_0 – x_\ast)\), and thus, following [13], $$\sum_{i=0}^m c_i (x_{k+i}-x_{k+i+1}) = \sum_{i=0}^m c_i A^{i} A^{k}(I – A )(x_0 -x_\ast) = P_m(A)(I – A) A^{k}(x_0 -x_\ast) ,$$ for \(P_m(\sigma)  =  \sum_{i=0}^m c_i \sigma^{i}\) a \(m\)-th order polynomial such that \(P_m(1) = 1\). We can write \(Uc\)  as $$ Uc = P_m(A) ( x_k – x_{k+1}) = ( I – A)  P_m(A)  (x_k – x_\ast) .$$ The error between the true limit and the extrapolation is equal to: $$  x_\ast – \sum_{i=0}^m c_i x_{k+i} = \sum_{i=0}^m c_i ( x_\ast – x_{k+i}  ) = P_m(A) (   x_\ast -x_{k}) = (I-A)^{-1} Uc.$$ Thus, we have $$ \Big\| x_\ast – \sum_{i=0}^m c_i x_{k+i} \Big\|_2 \leq \| U c \|_2 \times  \|(I – A)^{-1}\|_{\rm op} \leq \|(I – A)^{-1}\|_{\rm op}  \|I – A\|_{\rm op} \|P_m(A) ( x_k – x_\ast)\|.  $$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The method will be exact when one can find a degree \(m\) polynomial so that \(P_m(A) (x_{k} – x_\ast) = 0 \), and a sufficient condition is that \(P_m(A)=0\), which is only possible if \(A\) had only \(m\) distinct eigenvalues. This is exactly minimal polynomial extrapolation [9]. Another situation is when \(m = d\) (like for the special case of real sequences above). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Otherwise, the method will be inexact, but the method can find a good polynomial \(P_m\), and the error is less than the infimum of \( \|P_m(A) ( x_k – x_\ast)\|\) over all polynomial of degree \(m\) such that \(P_m(1)=1\). Assuming that the matrix \(A\) is symmetric and with all eigenvalues between \(-\rho\) and \(\rho\) (which will be the case for the gradient method below), then the error is less than the infimum of \(\sup_{\sigma \in [-\rho,\rho]} |P_m(\sigma)|\),  which is attained for the Chebyshev polynomial (see a <a href="https://francisbach.com/chebyshev-polynomials/">previous post</a>). The improvement in terms of convergence is similar to Chebyshev acceleration, but (a) without the need to know \(\rho\) in advance (the method is totally adaptive), and (b) with a provable robustness when the iterates deviate from following an autoregressive process (see [13] for details).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Going beyond linear recursions. </strong>As presented, Anderson acceleration does not lead to stable acceleration (see the experiment below for gradient descent). The main reason is that when iterates deviate from an autoregressive process, or when the recursion is naturally noisy, the estimation of the parameters \(c\) is unstable, in particular because the matrix \(U^\top U\) which has to be inverted is severely ill-conditioned [14]. In a joint work with Damien Scieur and Alexandre d’Aspremont, we considered regularizing  the estimation of \(c\) by penalizing its \(\ell_2\)-norm. We thus minimize  \( \| U c \|_2^2 + \lambda \| c\|_2^2\) such that \(c^\top 1_{m+1} = 1\), whose solution is $$ c \propto ( U^\top U + \lambda I)^{-1} 1_{m+1}, \mbox{ that is, } c = \frac{1}{1_{m+1}^\top (U^\top U + \lambda I)^{-1} 1_{m+1}}  ( U^\top U +  \lambda I)^{-1} 1_{m+1}.$$ This simple modification leads to theoretical guarantees for non-linear recursions, and I will refer to it as regularized non-linear acceleration (RNA, see [13] for details; the “non-linearity” comes from the non-linear dependence of \(c\) on the iterates).</p>



<h2>Application to gradient descent</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We can apply RNA to the recursion, $$x_{k+1}  = x_k – \gamma \nabla f(x_k),$$ where \(f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d\) is a differentiable function, and \(\gamma\) a step-size. In the plot below, we consider accelerating gradient descent with \(m\)-th order RNA, with \(m=8\). We compare this acceleration with applying RNA to each variable separately (“RNA-univ.”), and to the unregularized version (“Anderson”). We can see the benefits of our simple extrapolation steps, and in particular the instability of unregularized acceleration.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="419" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/anderson_grad_nonest.png" class="wp-image-2331" height="326" />Gradient descent on a regularized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic regression</a> problem, with 1000 observations in dimension 100. We compare regular gradient descent, to plain Anderson acceleration (with no regularization), RNA [13] applied to each variable separately, and RNA. All accelerations are with order \(m =8\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">In order to obtain stronger benefits from non-linear acceleration, several extensions are considered in [13]; in particular line search to find the good regularization parameter \(\lambda\) is quite useful. Another interesting extension is the <em>online</em> version of the algorithm [16, section 2.5], where the extrapolated sequence is used directly within the acceleration procedure, and not as a separate sequence with no interaction with the original gradient method: this corresponds to using RNA to accelerate iterates coming from RNA!</p>



<p class="justify-text">Moreover, while the simplest theoretical guarantees come for deterministic convex optimization problems and gradient descent, RNA can be extended to stochastic algorithms [15] and to non-convex optimization problems such as the ones encountered in deep learning [16].</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I described acceleration techniques that combine iterates of an existing algorithm, without the need to understand finely the inner structure of the original algorithm. They come at little extra-cost and can provide strong benefits.</p>



<p class="justify-text">This month’s post was dedicated to algorithms which converge linearly, that is, the iterates are asymptotically equivalent to sums of exponentials. Next month, I will consider situations where the convergence is sublinear, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson_extrapolation">Richardson extrapolation</a> excels.</p>

<h2>Asymptotic analysis for Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\) process</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In one dimension, we do not need the auto-regressive model to be exact, and an asymptotic analysis is possible. The asymptotic condition corresponds to \(\displaystyle \frac{x_{k+1}-x_\ast}{x_k – x_\ast}\) converging to a constant \(a \in [-1,1)\). More precisely if $$\frac{x_{k+1}-x_\ast}{x_k – x_\ast} = a + \varepsilon_{k+1},$$ with \(\varepsilon_k\) tending to zero, then we can estimate \(a\) through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitken%27s_delta-squared_process">Aitkens \(\Delta^2\) method</a> [1] as, $$ a_{k+1} = \frac{x_{k+1}-x_k}{x_{k}-x_{k-1}} = \frac{(x_{k+1}-x_\ast) – (x_k-x_\ast) }{(x_{k} – x_\ast) -( x_{k-1}-x_\ast) } = \frac{ a + \varepsilon_{k+1} – 1}{1 – 1/(a+\varepsilon_{k})} = a + \varepsilon_{k+1} + o( \varepsilon_{k+1}).$$ A closer Taylor expansion leads to $$ a + \varepsilon_{k} + \frac{1}{a-1}( \varepsilon_{k+1}- \varepsilon_{k}) + O(\varepsilon_{k}^2).$$ We can then provide a better estimate of \(x_\ast\) as $$ \frac{x_{k+1} – a_{k+1}x_k}{1- a_{k+1}} = x_\ast + \frac{x_{k+1} -x_\ast – a_{k+1}( x_k-x_\ast)}{1- a_{k+1}} = x_\ast + \frac{(a+\varepsilon_{k+1}-a_{k+1}) ( x_k – x_\ast)}{1-a_{k+1}},$$ whose difference with \(x_\ast\) is equivalent to $$ \frac{(a+\varepsilon_k-a_{k+1}) ( x_k – x_\ast)}{1-a }  \sim \frac{\varepsilon_{k+1}- \varepsilon_{k}}{(1-a)^2} ( x_k – x_\ast).$$ We have thus provided an acceleration of order \(\displaystyle \frac{\varepsilon_{k+1}- \varepsilon_{k}}{(1-a)^2} \).</p>



<h2>High-order Shanks transformation</h2>



<p>In order to relate our formulas to classical expressions, we first rewrite the recursion for \(m=1\) and then \(m=2\), and then to general \(m\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>First-order recursion (Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\)).</strong> We write the autorecursive recursion as $$ (x_{k+1} – x_\ast) = a ( x_{k} – x_\ast) \Leftrightarrow c_0(x_k – x_\ast) + c_1 (x_{k+1}-x_\ast) = 0 ,$$ with the constraint \(c_0 + c_1 = 1\), that is, \(c_0 = \frac{-a}{1-a}\) and \(c_1 = \frac{1}{1-a}\). We can then write \(x_\ast = c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1}\), and we have the linear system in \((c_0,c_1,x_\ast)\): $$  \left( \begin{array}{ccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ x_k &amp; x_{k+1} &amp; – 1  \end{array}\right)  \left( \begin{array}{c} c_0 \\ c_1 \\ x_\ast  \end{array}\right) =  \left( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right), $$ which can be solved using Cramer’s formula $$x_{\rm acc} = x_\ast = \frac{\left| \begin{array}{cc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2}  \\ x_{k} &amp; x_{k+1} \end{array}\right|}{\left| \begin{array}{cc}  x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2}  \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{array}\right|},$$  which leads to the same formula for \(x^{(1)}_k\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Second-order recursion.</strong> Here, we only consider the case \(m=2\) for simplicity. We consider the model, $$c_0 (x_k – x_\ast) + c_1 (x_{k+1} – x_\ast)+ c_{2} (x_{k+2} – x_\ast) = 0, $$ with the normalization \(c_0 + c_1 + c_2 = 1\). We can then extract \(x_\ast\) as $$ x_\ast = c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1} +  c_2 x_{k+2}.$$ In order to provide the extra \(2\) equations that are necessary to estimate the three parameters, we take first order differences and get $$c_0 (x_k -x_{k+1}) + c_1 (x_{k+1}-x_{k+2}) +  c_2 ( x_{k+2} – x_{k+3} ) =0,$$ for \(k\) and \(k+1\). This leads to the linear system in \((c_0,c_1, c_2, x_\ast)\): $$  \left( \begin{array}{cccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2} – x_{k+3} &amp; 0 \\  x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2}-x_{k+3} &amp;  x_{k+3} – x_{k+4} &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0  \\ x_{k} &amp; x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+2} &amp;  – 1  \end{array}\right)  \left( \begin{array}{c} c_0 \\ c_1 \\ c_2 \\ x_\ast  \end{array}\right) =  \left( \begin{array}{c}  0  \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right), $$ which can be solved using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramer%27s_rule">Cramer’s rule</a> (and classical manipulations of determinants) as $$x_k^{(2)} = \frac{\left| \begin{array}{ccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2} – x_{k+3}   \\  x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2}-x_{k+3} &amp;  x_{k+3} – x_{k+4}   \\ x_{k} &amp; x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+2}    \end{array} \right|}{\left| \begin{array}{ccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2} – x_{k+3}     \\ x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2}-x_{k+3} &amp;  x_{k+3} – x_{k+4}   \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp;  \end{array} \right|}.$$  </p>



<p class="justify-text">The formula extends to order \(m\) (see below) and is often called the Shanks transformation; it is cumbersome and not easy to use. However, the coefficients can be computed recursively (which is to be expected for a Hankel matrix, but rather tricky to derive), through Wynn’s \(\varepsilon\)-algorithm.  See [3] for a survey on acceleration and extrapolation.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Higher-order recursion.</strong> We consider the model, for \(m \geq 1\), $$c_0 (x_k – x_\ast) + c_1 (x_{k+1} – x_\ast) + \cdots + c_{m} (x_{k+m} – x_\ast) = 0, $$ with the normalization \(c_0 + c_1 + \cdots + c_m = 1\). We can then extract \(x_\ast\) as $$ x_\ast = c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1} + \cdots + c_m x_{k+m}.$$ In order to provide the extra \(m\) equations, we take first order differences and get $$c_0 (x_k -x_{k+1}) + c_1 (x_{k+1}-x_{k+2}) + \cdots + c_m ( x_{k+m} – x_{k+m+1} ) =0,$$ for \(k, k+1,\dots, k+m-1\). This leads to the linear system in \((c_0,c_1,\cdots, c_m, x_\ast)\): $$  \left( \begin{array}{ccccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+m} – x_{k+m+1} &amp; 0 \\  x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2}-x_{k+3} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+m+1} – x_{k+m+2} &amp; 0 \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;  &amp; \vdots  &amp; \vdots \\ x_{k+m-1}-x_{k+m} &amp; x_{k+m}-x_{k+m+1} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+2m-1} – x_{k+2m} &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; \dots &amp; 1 &amp; 0  \\ x_{k+m+1} &amp; x_{k+m+2} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+2m+1} &amp;  – 1  \end{array}\right)  \left( \begin{array}{c} c_0 \\ c_1 \\ \vdots \\ c_m \\ x_\ast  \end{array}\right) =  \left( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right), $$ which can be solved using Cramer’s formula $$x_\ast = \frac{\left|\begin{array}{cccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+m} – x_{k+m+1} \\  x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2}-x_{k+3} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+m+1} – x_{k+m+2}   \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;  &amp; \vdots  \\ x_{k+m-1}-x_{k+m} &amp; x_{k+m}-x_{k+m+1} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+2m-1} – x_{k+2m} \\ x_{k+m+1} &amp; x_{k+m+2} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+2m+1}  \end{array} \right|}{\left|\begin{array}{cccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+m} – x_{k+m+1} \\  x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2}-x_{k+3} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+m+1} – x_{k+m+2}   \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;  &amp; \vdots  \\ x_{k+m-1}-x_{k+m} &amp; x_{k+m}-x_{k+m+1} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+2m-1} – x_{k+2m} \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \end{array}  \right|}.$$  </p>

<p>In a <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2019/04/14/randomness-and-interaction-entanglement-ups-the-game/">previous post</a> I reported on the beautiful <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05870">recent result</a> by Natarajan and Wright showing the astounding power of multi-prover interactive proofs with quantum provers sharing entanglement: in letters, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BNEEXP%7D+%5Csubseteq+%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{NEEXP} \subseteq \text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" title="{\text{NEEXP} \subseteq \text{MIP}^\star}" />. In this post I want to report on follow-up work with Ji, Natarajan, Wright, and Yuen, that we just posted to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383">arXiv</a>. This time however I will tell the story from a personal point of view, with all the caveats that this implies: the “hard science” will be limited (but there could be a hint as to how “science”, to use a big word, “progresses”, to use an ill-defined one), the story is far too long, and it might be mostly of interest to me only. It’s a one-sided story, but that has to be. (In particular below I may at times attribute credit in the form “X had this idea”. This is my recollection only, and it is likely to be inaccurate. Certainly I am ignoring a lot of important threads.) I wrote this because I enjoyed recollecting some of the best moments in the story just as much as some the hardest; it is fun to look back and find meanings in ideas that initially appeared disconnected. Think of it as an example of how different lines of work can come together in unexpected ways; a case for open-ended research. It’s also an antidote against despair that I am preparing for myself: whenever I feel I’ve been stuck on a project for far too long, I’ll come back to this post and ask myself if it’s been 14 years yet — if not, then press on.</p>
<p>It likely comes as a surprise to me only that I am no longer fresh out of the cradle. My academic life started in earnest some 14 years ago, when in the Spring of 2006 I completed my Masters thesis in Computer Science under the supervision of Julia Kempe, at Orsay in France. I had met Julia the previous term: her class on quantum computing was, by far, the best-taught and most exciting course in the Masters program I was attending, and she had gotten me instantly hooked. Julia agreed to supervise my thesis, and suggested that I look into some interesting recent result by Stephanie Wehner that linked the study of entanglement and nonlocality in quantum mechanics to complexity-theoretic questions about interactive proof systems (specifically, this was Stephanie’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0508201">paper</a> showing that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BXOR-MIP%7D%5E%5Cstar+%5Csubseteq+%5Ctext%7BQIP%7D%282%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{XOR-MIP}^\star \subseteq \text{QIP}(2)}" class="latex" title="{\text{XOR-MIP}^\star \subseteq \text{QIP}(2)}" />).</p>
<p>At the time the topic was very new. It had been initiated the previous year with a beautiful <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0404076">paper</a> by Cleve et al. (that I have recommended to many a student since!). It was a perfect fit for me: the mathematical aspects of complexity theory and quantum computing connected to my undergraduate background, while the relative concreteness of quantum mechanics (it is a physical theory after all) spoke to my desire for real-world connection (not “impact” or even “application” — just “connection”). Once I got myself up to speed in the area (which consisted of three papers: the two I already mentioned, together with a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0102013">paper</a> by Kobayashi and Matsumoto where they studied interactive proofs with quantum messages), Julia suggested looking into the the “entangled-prover” class <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}" /> introduced in the aforementioned paper by Cleve et al. Nothing was known about this class! Nothing besides the trivial inclusion of single-prover interactive proofs, IP, and the containment in…ALL, the trivial class that contains all languages.<br />
Yet the characterization MIP=NEXP of its classical counterpart by Babai et al. in the 1990s had led to one of the most productive lines of work in complexity of the past few decades, through the PCP theorem and its use from hardness of approximation to efficient cryptographic schemes. Surely, studying <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}" /> had to be a productive direction? In spite of its well-established connection to classical complexity theory, via the formalism of interactive proofs, this was a real gamble. The study of entanglement from the complexity-theoretic perspective was entirely new, and bound to be fraught with difficulty; very few results were available and the existing lines of works, from the foundations of nonlocality to more recent endeavors in device-independent cryptography, provided little other starting point than strong evidence that even the simplest examples came with many unanswered questions. But my mentor was fearless, and far from a novice in terms of defraying new areas, having done pioneering work in areas ranging from quantum random walks to Hamiltonian complexity through adiabatic computation. Surely this would lead to something?</p>
<p>It certainly did. More sleepless nights than papers, clearly, but then the opposite would only indicate dullness. Julia’s question led to far more unexpected consequences than I, or I believe she, could have imagined at the time. I am writing this post to celebrate, in a personal way, the latest step in 15 years of research by dozens of researchers: today my co-authors and I uploaded to the quant-ph arXiv what we consider a complete characterization of the power of entangled-prover interactive proof systems by proving the equality <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar+%3D+%5Ctext%7BRE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{MIP}^\star = \text{RE}}" class="latex" title="{\text{MIP}^\star = \text{RE}}" />, the class of all recursively enumerable languages (a complete problem for RE is the halting problem). Without goign too much into the result itself (if you’re interested, we have a long introduction waiting for you), and since this is a personal blog, I will continue on with some personal thoughts about the path that got us there.</p>
<p>When Julia &amp; I started working on the question, our main source of inspiration were the results by Cleve et al. showing that the nonlocal correlations of entanglement had interesting consequences when seen through the lens of interactive proof systems in complexity theory. Since the EPR paper a lot of work in understanding entanglement had already been accomplished in the Physics community, most notably by Mermin, Peres, Bell, and more recently the works in device-indepent quantum cryptography by Acin, Pironio, Scarani and many others stimulated by Ekert’s proposal for quantum key distribution and Mayers and Yao’s idea for “device-independent cryptography”. By then we certainly knew that “spooky action-at-a-distance” did not entail any faster-than-light communication, and indeed was not really “action-at-a-distance” in the first place but merely “correlation-at-a-distance”. What Cleve et al. recognized is that these “spooky correlations-at-a-distance” were sufficiently special so as to not only give numerically different values in “Bell inequalities”, the tool invented by Bell to evidence nonlocality in quantum mechanics, but also have some potentially profound consequences in complexity theory. In particular, examples such as the “Magic Square game” demonstrated that enough correlation could be gained from entanglement so as to defeat basic proof systems whose soundness relied only on the absence of communication between the provers, an assumption that until then had been wrongly equated with the assumption that any computation performed by the provers could be modeled entirely locally. I think that the fallacy of this implicit assumption came as a surprise to complexity theorists, who may still not have entirely internalized it. Yet the perfect quantum strategy for the Magic Square game provides a very concrete “counter-example” to the soundness of the “clause-vs-variable” game for 3SAT. Indeed this game, a reformulation by Aravind and Cleve-Mermin of a Bell Inequality discovered by Mermin and Peres in 1990, can be easily re-framed as a 3SAT system of equations that is <em>not</em> satisfiable and yet is such that the associated two-player clause-vs-variable game has a <em>perfect</em> quantum strategy. It is this observation, made in the paper by Cleve et al., that gave the first strong hint that the use of entanglement in interactive proof systems could make many classical results in the area go awry.</p>
<p>By importing the study of non-locality into complexity theory Cleve et al. immediately brought it into the realm of asymptotic analysis. Complexity theorists don’t study fixed objects, they study families of objects that tend to have a uniform underlying structure and whose interesting properties manifest themselves “in the limit”. As a result of this new perspective focus shifted from the study of single games or correlations to infinite families thereof. Some of the early successes of this translation include the “unbounded violations” that arose from translating asymptotic separations in communication complexity to the language of Bell inequalities and correlations (e.g. this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.5043">paper</a>). These early successes attracted the attention of some physicists working in foundations as well as some mathematical physicists, leading to a productive exploration that combined tools from quantum information, functional analysis and complexity theory.</p>
<p>The initial observations made by Cleve et al. had pointed to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}" /> as a possibly interesting complexity class to study. Rather amazingly, nothing was known about it! They had shown that under strong restrictions on the verifier’s predicate (it should be an XOR of two answer bits), a collapse took place: by the work of Hastad, XOR-MIP equals NEXP, but <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BXOR-MIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{XOR-MIP}^\star}" class="latex" title="{\text{XOR-MIP}^\star}" /> is included in EXP. This seemed very fortuitous (the inclusion is proved via a connection with semidefinite programming that seems tied to the structure of XOR-MIP protocols): could entanglement induce a collapse of the entire, unrestricted class? We thought (at this point mostly Julia thought, because I had no clue) that this ought not to be the case, and so we set ourselves to show that the equality <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%3D%5Ctext%7BNEXP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{MIP}^\star=\text{NEXP}}" class="latex" title="{\text{MIP}^\star=\text{NEXP}}" />, that would directly parallel Babai et al.’s characterization MIP=NEXP, holds. We tried to show this by introducing techniques to “immunize” games against entanglement: modify an interactive proof system so that its structure makes it “resistant” to the kind of “nonlocal powers” that can be used to defeat the clause-vs-variable game (witness the Magic Square). This was partially successful, and led to one of the papers I am most proud of — I am proud of it because I think it introduced elementary techniques (such as the use of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality — inside joke — more seriously, basic things such as “prover-switching”, “commutation tests”, etc.) that are now routine manipulations in the area. The paper was a hard sell! It’s good to remember the first rejections we received. They were not unjustified: the main point of criticism was that we were only able to establish a hardness result for exponentially small completeness-soundness gap. A result for such a small gap in the classical setting follows directly from a very elementary analysis based on the Cook-Levin theorem. So then why did we have to write so many pages (and so many applications of Cauchy-Schwarz!) to arrive at basically the same result (with a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{^\star}" class="latex" title="{^\star}" />)?</p>
<p>Eventually we got lucky and the paper was accepted to a conference. But the real problem, of establishing any non-trivial lower bound on the class <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}" /> with constant (or, in the absence of any parallel repetition theorem, inverse-polynomial) completeness-soundness gap, remained. By that time I had transitioned from a Masters student in France to a graduate student in Berkeley, and the problem (pre-)occupied me during some of the most difficult years of my Ph.D. I fully remember spending my first year entirely thinking about this (oh and sure, that systems class I had to pass to satisfy the Berkeley requirements), and then my second year — yet, getting nowhere. (I checked the arXiv to make sure I’m not making this up: two full years, no posts.) I am forever grateful to my fellow student Anindya De for having taken me out of the cycle of torture by knocking on my door with one of the most interesting questions I have studied, that led me into quantum cryptography and quickly resulted in an enjoyable <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.4680">paper</a>. It was good to feel productive again! (Though the paper had fun reactions as well: after putting it on the arXiv we quickly heard from experts in the area that we had solved an irrelevant problem, and that we better learn about information theory — which we did, eventually leading to another <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.5514">paper</a>, etc.) The project had distracted me and I set interactive proofs aside; clearly, I was stuck.</p>
<p>About a year later I visited IQC in Waterloo. I don’t remember in what context the visit took place. What I do remember is a meeting in the office of Tsuyoshi Ito, at the time a postdoctoral scholar at IQC. Tsuyoshi asked me to explain our result with Julia. He then asked a very pointed question: the bedrock for the classical analysis of interactive proof systems is the “linearity test” of Blum-Luby-Rubinfeld (BLR). Is there any sense in which we could devise a quantum version of that test?</p>
<p>What a question! This was great. At first it seemed fruitless: in what sense could one argue that quantum provers apply a “linear function”? Sure, quantum mechanics is linear, but that is besides the point. The linearity is a property of the prover’s answers as a function of their question. So what to make of the quantum state, the inherent randomness, etc.?</p>
<p>It took us a few months to figure it out. Once we got there however, the answer was relatively simple — the prover should be making a question-independent measurement that returns a linear function that it applies to its question in order to obtain the answer returned to the verifier — and it opened the path to our subsequent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0550">paper</a> showing that the inclusion of NEXP in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}" /> indeed holds. Tsuyoshi’s question about linearity testing had allowed us to make the connection with PCP techniques; from there to MIP=NEXP there was only one step to make, which is to analyze multi-linearity testing. That step was suggested by my Ph.D. advisor, Umesh Vazirani, who was well aware of the many pathways towards the classical PCP theorem (indeed a lot of the activity that led to the proof of the theorem took place in Berkeley, with many of Umesh’s current or former students making substantial contributions). It took a lot of technical work, yet conceptually a single question from my co-author had sufficed to take me out of a 3-year slumber.</p>
<p>This was in 2012, and I thought we were done. For some reason the converse inclusion, of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}" /> in NEXP, seemed to resist our efforts, but surely it couldn’t resist much longer. Navascues et al. had introduced a hierarchy of semidefinite programs that seemed to give the right answer (technically they could only show convergence to a relaxation, the commuting value, but that seemed like a technicality; in particular, the values coincide when restricted to finite-dimensional strategies, which is all we computer scientists cared about). There were no convergence bounds on the hierarchy, yet at the same time commutative SDP hierarchies were being used to obtain very strong results in combinatorial optimization, and it seemed like it would only be a matter of time before someone came up with an analysis of the quantum case. (I had been trying to solve a related “dimension reduction problem” with Oded Regev for years, and we were making no progress; yet it seemed <em>someone</em> ought to!)</p>
<p>In Spring 2014 during an open questions session at a <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/qhc2014-1">workshop</a> at the Simons Institute in Berkeley Dorit Aharonov suggested that I ask the question of the possible inclusion of QMA-EXP, the exponential-sized-proofs analogue of QMA, in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}" />. A stronger result than the inclusion of NEXP (under assumptions), wouldn’t it be a more natural “fully quantum” analogue of MIP=NEXP? Dorit’s suggestion was motivated by research on the “quantum PCP theorem”, that aims to establish similar hardness results in the realm of the local Hamiltonian problem; see e.g. <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2014/10/31/quantum-pcp-conjectures/">this post</a> for the connection. I had no idea how to approach the question — I also didn’t really believe the answer could be positive — but what can you do, if Dorit asks you something… So I reluctantly went to the board and asked the question. Joe Fitzsimons was in the audience, and he immediately picked it up! Joe had the fantastic ideas of using quantum error-correction, or more specifically secret-sharing, to distribute a quantum proof among the provers. His enthusiasm overcame my skepticism, and we eventually <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0260">showed</a> the desired inclusion. Maybe <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}" /> <em>was</em> bigger than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BNEXP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{NEXP}}" class="latex" title="{\text{NEXP}}" /> after all.</p>
<p>Our result, however, had a similar deficiency as the one with Julia, in that the completeness-soundness gap was exponentially small. Obtaining a result with a constant gap took 3 years of couple more years of work and the fantastic energy and insights of a Ph.D. student at MIT, Anand Natarajan. Anand is the first person I know of to have had the courage to dive in to the most technical aspects of the analysis of the aforementioned results, while also bringing in the insights of a “true quantum information theorist” that were supported by Anand’s background in Physics and upbringing in the group of Aram Harrow at MIT. (In contrast I think of myself more as a “raw” mathematician; I don’t really understand quantum states other than as psd matrices…not that I understand math either of course; I suppose I’m some kind of a half-baked mish-mash.) Anand had many ideas but one of the most beautiful ones led to what he poetically called the “Pauli braiding test”, a “truly quantum” analogue of the BLR linearity test that amounts to doing <em>two</em> linearity tests in conjugate bases and piecing the results together into a robust test for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />-qubit entanglement (I wrote about our work on this <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2017/06/28/pauli-braiding/">here</a>).</p>
<p>At approximately the same time Zhengfeng Ji had another wonderful idea, that was in some sense orthogonal to our work. (My interpretation of) Zhengfeng’s idea is that one can see an interactive proof system as a computation (verifier-prover-verifier) and use Kitaev’s circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction to transform the entire computation into a “quantum CSP” (in the same sense that the local Hamiltonian problem is a quantum analogue of classical constraint satisfaction problems (CSP)) that could then itself be verified by a quantum multi-prover interactive proof system…with exponential gains in efficiency! Zhengfeng’s result implied an exponential improvement in complexity compared to the result by Julia and myself, showing inclusion of NEEXP, instead of NEXP, in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}" />. However, Zhengfeng’s technique suffered from the same exponentially small completeness-soundness gap as we had, so that the best lower bound on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}" /> per se remained NEXP.</p>
<p>Both works led to follow-ups. With Natarajan we promoted the Pauli braiding test into a “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03821">quantum low-degree test</a>” that allowed us to show the inclusion of QMA-EXP into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}" />, with constant gap, thereby finally answering the question posed by Aharonov 4 years after it was asked. (I should also say that by then all results on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}" /> started relying on a sequence of parallel repetition results shown by Bavarian, Yuen, and others; I am skipping this part.) In parallel, with Ji, Fitzsimons, and Yuen we showed that Ji’s compression technique could be “iterated” an arbitrary number of times. In fact, by going back to “first principles” and representing verifiers uniformly as Turing machines we realized that the compression technique could be used iteratively to (up to small caveats) give a new proof of the fact (first <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08618">shown</a> by Slofstra using an embedding theorem for finitely presented group) that the zero-gap version of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}" /> contains the halting problem. In particular, the entangled value is uncomputable! This was not the first time that uncomputability crops in to a natural problem in quantum computing (e.g. the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04573">spectral gap paper</a>), yet it still surprises when it shows up. Uncomputable! How can anything be uncomputable!</p>
<p>As we were wrapping up our paper Henry Yuen realized that our “iterated compression of interactive proof systems” was likely optimal, in the following sense. Even a mild improvement of the technique, in the form of a slower closing of the completeness-soundness gap through compression, would yield a much stronger result: undecidability of the constant-gap class <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}" />. It was already known by work of Navascues et al., Fritz, and others, that such a result would have, if not surprising, certainly consequences that seemed like they would be taking us out of our depth. In particular, undecidability of any language in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}" /> would imply a negative resolution to a series of equivalent conjectures in functional analysis, from Tsirelson’s problem to Connes’ Embedding Conjecture through Kirchberg’s QWEP conjecture. While we liked our result, I don’t think that we believed it could resolve any conjecture(s) in functional analysis.</p>
<p>So we moved on. At least I moved on, I did some cryptography for a change. But Anand Natarajan and his co-author John Wright did not stop there. They had the last major insight in this story, which underlies their recent STOC best paper described in the previous <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2019/04/14/randomness-and-interaction-entanglement-ups-the-game/">post</a>. Briefly, they were able to combine the two lines of work, by Natarajan &amp; myself on low-degree testing and by Ji et al. on compression, to obtain a compression that is specially tailored to the existing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}" /> protocol for NEXP and compresses that protocol without reducing its completeness-soundness gap. This then let them show Ji’s result that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}" /> contains NEEXP, but this time with constant gap! The result received well-deserved attention. In particular, it is the first in this line of works to not suffer from any caveats (such as a closing gap, or randomized reductions, or some kind of “unfair” tweak on the model that one could attribute the gain in power to), and it implies an unconditional separation between MIP and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}" />.</p>
<p>As they were putting the last touches on their result, suddenly something happened, which is that a path towards a much bigger result opened up. What Natarajan &amp; Wright had achieved is a one-step gapless compression. In our iterated compression paper we had observed that iterated gapless compression would lead to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%3D%5Ctext%7BRE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{MIP}^\star=\text{RE}}" class="latex" title="{\text{MIP}^\star=\text{RE}}" />, implying negative answers to the aforementioned conjectures. So then?</p>
<p>I suppose it took some more work, but in some way all the ideas had been laid out in the previous 15 years of work in the complexity of quantum interactive proof systems; we just had to put it together. And so a decade after the characterization <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.4737">QIP = PSPACE</a> of single-prover quantum interactive proof systems, we have arrived at a characterization of quantum multiprover interactive proof systems, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar+%3D+%5Ctext%7BRE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\text{MIP}^\star = \text{RE}}" class="latex" title="{\text{MIP}^\star = \text{RE}}" />. With one author in common between the two papers: congratulations Zhengfeng!</p>
<p>Even though we just posted a paper, in a sense there is much more left to do. I am hopeful that our complexity-theoretic result will attract enough interest from the mathematicians’ community, and especially operator algebraists, for whom CEP is a central problem, that some of them will be willing to devote time to understanding the result. I also recognize that much effort is needed on our own side to make it accessible in the first place! I don’t doubt that eventually complexity theory will not be needed to obtain the purely mathematical consequences; yet I am hopeful that some of the ideas may eventually find their way into the construction of interesting mathematical objects (such as, who knows, a non-hyperlinear group).</p>
<p>That was a good Masters project…thanks Julia!</p></div>

<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p class="justify-text">I sometimes joke with my students about one of the main tools I have been using in the last ten years: the explicit sum of a geometric series. <em>Why is this?</em></p>



<h2>From numbers to operators</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The simplest version of this basic result for real numbers is the following: $$ \forall r \neq 1, \ \forall n \geq 0, \   \sum_{k=0}^n r^k = \frac{1-r^{n+1}}{1-r},$$ and is typically proved by multiplying the two sides by \(1-r\) and forming a telescoping sum. When \(|r|&lt;1\), we can let \(n\) tend to infinity and get $$ \forall |r| &lt;  1, \  \sum_{k=0}^\infty r^k = \frac{1}{1-r}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Proofs without words.</strong> There is a number of classical proofs of the last identities, many of them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_without_words">without words</a>, presented in the beautiful series of books by Roger Nelsen [1, 2, 3]. I particularly like the two below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="478" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/triangles-1-1024x447.png" class="wp-image-1916" height="209" />Proof of the infinite sum of a geometric series with \(r=\frac{1}{2}.\) The area of the right triangle which is the half of a square with side length equal to \(2\), is equal to \(2\) and to the sum of the areas of the smaller triangles, that is, \(2 = \frac{1}{1- \frac{1}{2}}= 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \cdots\). Adapted from [3, p. 155].</figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="430" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/rectangles_r.png" class="wp-image-2005" height="390" />Proof of the finite sum of a geometric series, started at \(k=0\) up to \(k=n=5\). The area of the full square of unit side length is equal to the sum of the areas of all yellow rectangles plus the pink one, that is, \(1 = (1-r) \sum_{k=0}^n r^k + r^{n+1}\). Adapted from [1, p. 118].</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>High school: from philosophy to trigonometry.</strong> Before looking at extensions beyond real numbers, I can’t resist mentioning some of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes">Zeno’s paradoxes</a>, like Achilles and the tortoise, which are intimately linked with the sum of a geometric series (and which were a highlight of my high school philosophy “career”).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Speaking of high school, it is interesting to note that there, the core identity of this blog post, is often used as \(a^{n+1}-b^{n+1} = (a-b)(a^n+a^{n-1}b+\cdots+ab^{n-1}+b^{n})\) in order to factorize polynomials (and not in the other way around like done later in this post).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Another nice elementary use of geometric series comes up with complex numbers, in order to compute sum of cosines, such as: $$\! \sum_{k=0}^n \! \cos k\theta = {\rm Re} \Big(\!\sum_{k=0}^n e^{ i k \theta}\!\Big) = {\rm Re} \Big(\!\frac{e^{i(n+1)\theta}-1}{e^{i\theta}-1}\!\Big) =  {\rm Re} \Big(\! \frac{ \sin \frac{n+1}{2} \theta e^{i(n+1)\theta/2}}{ \sin \frac{\theta}{2} e^{i\theta/2} }\!\Big) = \frac{  \sin \frac{n+1}{2} \theta}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} \cos \frac{n\theta}{2}. $$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Square matrices and operators.</strong> Within applied mathematics, the matrix and operator versions are the most useful. For \(A\) a square matrix or any linear operator, we have $$ \forall A \mbox{ such that } I-A \mbox{ is invertible}, \  \sum_{k=0}^n A^k = (I-A)^{-1}(I-A^{n+1}),$$ with the classical proof: \(\displaystyle (I – A)\sum_{k=0}^n A^k = \sum_{k=0}^n A^k – \sum_{k=1}^{n+1} A^k = I – A^{n+1}.\)</p>



<p class="justify-text">When \(\| A\| &lt;1\) for any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm">matrix norm</a> induced from a vector norm, we can let \(n\) go to infinity, to obtain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neumann_series">Neumann series</a> \(\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^n A^k = (I-A)^{-1}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We are now ready to talk about machine learning and optimization!</p>



<h2>Stochastic gradient for quadratic functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Matrix geometric series come up naturally when analyzing iterative algorithms based on linear recursions. In this blog post, I will focus on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) techniques to solve the following problem: $$ \min_{\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d} F(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E} \big[ y – \theta^\top \Phi(x) \big]^2,$$ where the expectation is taken with respect to some joint distribution on \((x,y)\). We denote by \(\theta_\ast \in \mathbb{R}^d\) the minimizer of the objective function above (which is assumed to exist). We assume the feature vector \(\Phi(x)\) is high-dimensional, so that the moment matrix \(H = \mathbb{E} \big[ \Phi(x)\Phi(x)^\top \big]\) cannot be assumed to be invertible.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Stochastic gradient descent recursion. </strong>Starting from some initial guess \(\theta_0 \in \mathbb{R}^d\), typically \(\theta_0 =0\), the SGD recursion is: $$  \theta_n = \theta_{n-1} – \gamma ( \theta_{n-1}^\top \Phi(x_n) \, – y_n) \Phi(x_n),$$ where \((x_n,y_n)\) is an independent sample from the distribution mentioned above, and \(\gamma &gt; 0\) is the step-size. This algorithm dates back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_approximation">Robbins and Monro</a> in the 50’s and is particularly adapted to machine learning as it updates the parameter \(\theta\) after each observation \((x_n,y_n)\) (as opposed to waiting for a full pass over the data).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Denoting \(\varepsilon_n = y_n – \theta_\ast^\top \Phi(x_n)\) the residual between the observation \(y_n\) and the optimal linear prediction \(\theta_\ast^\top \Phi(x_n)\), we can rewrite the SGD recursion as $$\theta_n = \theta_{n-1} – \gamma ( \theta_{n-1}^\top \Phi(x_n) \, – \theta_{\ast}^\top \Phi(x_n) -\, \varepsilon_n) \Phi(x_n),$$ leading to $$\theta_n \, – \theta_\ast = \big[ I – \gamma \Phi(x_n) \Phi(x_n)^\top \big] ( \theta_{n-1}- \theta_\ast) + \gamma \varepsilon_n \Phi(x_n).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">This is a stochastic linear recursion on the deviation to optimum \(\theta_n \, – \theta_\ast\). The expectation of the SGD recursion is: $$\mathbb{E} [ \theta_n] \, – \theta_\ast = \big[ I – \gamma H \big] ( \mathbb{E}[ \theta_{n-1}] – \theta_\ast), $$ where \(H = \mathbb{E} \big[ \Phi(x) \Phi(x)^\top \big]\), and where we have used that  \(\gamma \varepsilon_n \Phi(x_n)\) has zero expectation (as a consequence of optimality conditions for \(\theta_\ast\)). This is exactly the gradient descent recursion on the expected loss (which cannot be run in practice because we only have access to a finite amount of data).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Simplification. </strong>The main difficulty in analyzing the stochastic recursion is the presence of two sources of randomness when compared to the gradient descent recursion: (A) some additive noise \(\gamma \varepsilon_n \Phi(x_n)\) independent of the current iterate \(\theta_{n-1}\) and with zero expectation, and (B) some multiplicative noise \(\gamma \big[  H – \Phi(x_n) \Phi(x_n)^\top \big] (\theta_{n-1} – \theta_\ast)\), which comes from the use of \(  I – \gamma \Phi(x_n) \Phi(x_n)^\top  \) instead of \(I – \gamma H\), and depends on the current iterate \(\theta_{n-1}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, for simplicity, I will ignore the multiplicative noise and only focus on the additive noise, and thus consider the recursion $$\theta_n\, – \theta_\ast = ( I – \gamma H )  ( \theta_{n-1}- \theta_\ast) + \gamma \varepsilon_n \Phi(x_n).$$ Detailed studies with multiplicative noise can be found in [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4900-non-strongly-convex-smooth-stochastic-approximation-with-convergence-rate-o1n.pdf">4</a>, <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v38/defossez15.pdf">5</a>, <a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-335/16-335.pdf">6</a>, <a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-595/16-595.pdf">7</a>], and lead to similar results. Moreover, I will assume (again for simplicity) that \(\varepsilon_n\) and \(\Phi(x_n)\) are independent, and that \(\mathbb{E} [ \varepsilon_n^2 ] = \sigma^2\) (which corresponds to uniform noise of variance \(\sigma^2\) on top of the optimal linear predictions); again, results directly extends without this assumption.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Bias / variance decomposition. </strong>Having a constant multiplicative term \(I – \gamma H\) in the recursion leads to an explicit formula: $$\theta_n – \theta_\ast = ( I – \gamma H ) ^n ( \theta_{0}- \theta_\ast) + \sum_{k=1}^n \gamma  ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n-k} \varepsilon_k \Phi(x_k),$$ which is now easy to analyze. It is the sum of a deterministic term depending on initial conditions,  and a zero mean term which is the sum of independent zero-mean terms due to the noise in the gradients. Thus, we can compute the expectation of the excess risk \(F(\theta_n)\, – F(\theta_\ast) = \frac{1}{2} ( \theta_n – \theta_\ast)^\top H ( \theta_n – \theta_\ast)\), as follows: $$\! \mathbb{E} \big[ F(\theta_n) \,- F(\theta_\ast)\big] = {\rm Bias} + { \rm Variance}, $$ where the bias term characterizes the forgetting of initial conditions: $$ {\rm Bias} = \frac{1}{2}  ( \theta_0 – \theta_\ast)^\top ( I – \gamma H ) ^{2n} H ( \theta_0 – \theta_\ast),  $$ and the variance term characterizes the effect of the noise: $${\rm Variance} =  \frac{\gamma^2 }{2}\! \sum_{k=1}^n \! \mathbb{E} \big[ \varepsilon_k^2 \Phi(x_k)^\top ( I – \gamma H ) ^{2n-2k}H  \Phi(x_k) \big] = \frac{\gamma^2  \sigma^2}{2}\! \sum_{k=1}^n \! {\rm tr} \big[  ( I – \gamma H ) ^{2n-2k}H^2   \big] .$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The bias term is exactly the convergence rate of gradient descent on the expected risk, and can be controlled by upper-bounding the eigenvalues of the matrix  \(( I – \gamma H ) ^{2n} H\). As shown at the end of the post, when \(\gamma \leq \frac{1}{L}\), where \(L\) is the largest eigenvalue of \(H\), then this matrix has all eigenvalues less than \(1/(4n\gamma)\), leading to a bound on the bias term of $$ \frac{1}{8 \gamma n} \|\theta_0 – \theta_\ast\|^2.$$ We recover the traditional \(O(1/n)\) convergence rate of gradient descent. For the variance term we use the sum of a geometric series, to obtain the bound $$\frac{\gamma^2  \sigma^2}{2}   {\rm tr} \big[ H^2( I – (I – \gamma H)^2 )^{-1}  \big] = \frac{\gamma^2  \sigma^2}{2}  {\rm tr} \big[ H^2( 2\gamma H – \gamma^2 H^2 )^{-1}  \big] \leq \frac{\gamma  \sigma^2}{2}  {\rm tr}(H) .$$ While the bias term that characterizes the forgetting of initial conditions goes to zero as \(n\) goes to infinity, this is not the case for the variance term. This is the traditional lack of convergence of SGD with a constant step-size. In the left plot of the figure below, we compare deterministic gradient descent to stochastic gradient with a constant step-size. For convergence rates in higher dimension, see further below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img width="564" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/paths_video-1.gif" class="wp-image-2039" height="236" />Gradient descent algorithms run from the same starting point. Left plot: plain gradient descent (GD), plain (non-averaged) gradient descent (SGD). Right plot: averaged SGD with uniform weights (ASGD-1) and with weights proportional to the iteration index (ASGD-k).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Convergence can be obtained by using a decreasing step-size, typically of the order \(1 / \sqrt{n},\) leading to an overall convergence rate proportional to \(1 / \sqrt{n}.\) This can be improved through averaging, which I now present.</p>



<h2>Impact of averaging</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider the averaged iterate \(\bar{\theta}_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \sum_{k=0}^n \theta_k\), an off-line (no interaction with the stochastic recursion) averaging often referred to as Polyak–Ruppert averaging, after [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/0330046">8</a>, 9]. The averaged iterate can also be expressed as a linear function of initial conditions and noise variables as $$\bar{\theta}_n -\theta_\ast = \frac{1}{n+1} \sum_{k=0}^n  ( I – \gamma H ) ^k ( \theta_{0}- \theta_\ast) + \frac{\gamma}{n+1}   \sum_{k=1}^n \sum_{j=k}^n   ( I – \gamma H ) ^{j-k} \varepsilon_k \Phi(x_k).$$ Geometric series come in again! We can get a closed form for \(\bar{\theta}_n -\theta_\ast\) as: $$\frac{1}{n+1} (\gamma H)^{-1} \big[ I – ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n+1} \big] ( \theta_{0}- \theta_\ast) + \frac{\gamma}{n+1} (\gamma H)^{-1} \sum_{k=1}^n \big[ I – ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n-k+1} \big] \varepsilon_k \Phi(x_k).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The bound on \(\mathbb{E} \big[ F(\bar{\theta}_n) \,- F(\theta_\ast)\big] \), will here also be composed of a bias term and a variance term. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Bias.</strong> The bias term is equal to $$\frac{1}{2(n+1)^2}( \theta_{0}- \theta_\ast) ^\top   (\gamma H)^{-2} H \big[ I – ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n+1} \big]^2 ( \theta_{0}- \theta_\ast).$$ Using the fact that the eigenvalues of the matrix \( (\gamma H)^{-2} H \big[ I – ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n+1} \big]^2\) are all less than \((n+1)/\gamma\) (see proof at the end of the post), we obtain the upper bound $$ \frac{1}{2 (n+1)\gamma} \| \theta_0 – \theta_\ast\|^2,$$ which is essentially the same than with averaging (but, see an important difference in the discussion below, regarding the behavior for large \(n\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Variance.</strong> The variance term is equal to $$ \frac{\gamma^2}{2 (n+1)^2}  \sum_{k=1}^n \sigma^2 {\rm tr} \Big( \big[ I – ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n-k+1} \big]^2 (\gamma H)^{-2} H^2 \Big).$$ Using the positivity of the matrix \(( I – \gamma H )\), we finally obtain the following bound for variance term: $$  \frac{ \sigma^2 n {\rm tr}(I)}{2(n+1)^2}\leq \frac{\sigma^2 d}{2n}.$$ We now have a convergent algorithm, and we recover traditional quantities from the statistical analysis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares">least-squares regression</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Experiments.</strong> Now, both bias and variance are converging at rate \(1/n\). See an illustration in two dimensions in the right plot of the figure above, as well as a convergence rates below. In these two figures, what differs is the decay of eigenvalues of \(H\) (fast in the first figure, slower in the second).</p>

<p>We can make the following observations:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>Depending on the amount of noise in the gradients, the sum of the variance and the bias terms will either be dominated by one of the two; typically the bias term in early iterations, and then the variance term (see more  details in [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v38/defossez15.pdf">5</a>]).</li><li>The variance term of non-averaged SGD is converging to a constant (while the bias term is exactly the one of regular gradient descent).</li><li>With averaging, the variance terms decay as a line in a log-log plot. The reader with good eyes can check that the slope is indeed -1, thus illustrating the convergence rate in \(1/n\) (here the bound is tight). For the variance terms (right plots), there is no significant difference between the two eigenvalue decays.</li><li>The bias terms have different behaviors for the two decays. For the fast decays (top plot), the bounds in \(1/n\) are reasonably tight (lines of slope -1). For slower decay, we see some strong-convexity behavior entering the scene, as the slowest eigenvalue is 1/100 and the number of iterations is far larger than 100, and thus the optimization problem looks strongly convex, and then the bias term of plain SGD (which corresponds to deterministic gradient descent) converges exponentially fast, while the two averaging techniques decay as powers of \(n\) (again, the acute reader can spot slopes of -2 and -4, and the smart reader can explain why; more on this in a future post dedicated to SGD).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Pros and cons of averaging.</strong> Overall, we can see that averaging may slow down the forgetting of initial conditions, while it makes the method robust to noise in the gradients. The trade-off depends on the amount of noise, but in most high-dimensional learning problems and for the accuracies practitioners are interested in (no need to have an excess risk of \(10^{-5}\) then the best risk is of order \(10^{-1}\)), the bias term is the one which is seen the most. Thus, a less-aggressive form of averaging that puts more weights on later iterates seems advantageous (pink curve above). More on this in a future blog post.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Beyond least-squares.</strong> In this blog post, to illustrate the use of sums of geometric series, I have focused on an idealized version (no multiplicative noise) of least-squares regression. For other losses, e.g., logistic loss, the analysis is more involved, and averaging does not lead to a converging algorithm, but transforms a term in \(\gamma\) into a term in \(\gamma^2\), which is still a significant improvement when the step-size \(\gamma\) is small (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06386">10</a>] for more details).</p>



<h3>Extensions</h3>



<p class="justify-text">The sum of a geometric series can be extended in a variety of ways. For example, we can take the derivative with respect to \(r\), to get $$ \forall r \neq 1, \  \sum_{k=1}^n k r^{k-1} = \frac{1-r^{n+1}}{(1-r)^2} – \frac{ (n+1) r^n}{1-r} = \frac{1 + n r^{n+1} – (n+1) r^n }{(1-r)^2}.$$ This is useful for example to compute the performance of the weighted average \(\frac{2}{n(n+1)} \sum_{k=1}^n k \theta_k\). This can be extended further with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_series">binomial series</a> $$ (1-r)^{-1-\beta} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty { k + \beta \choose k} r^k. $$</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I have essentially used the sum of a geometric series as an excuse to talk about stochastic gradient descent, but there are other places where such series pop out, such as in the analysis of Markov chains and the associated ergodic theorems [11], which are ubiquitous in the analysis of simulation algorithms.</p>



<p class="justify-text">This year, I am still planning to post every first Monday of the month. Expect additional posts on acceleration, stochastic gradient, and orthogonal polynomials, but also new topics should be covered, always with connections with machine learning. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Happy new year!</p>

<h2>Detailed computations</h2>



<p><strong>Bounds on eigenvalues – I.</strong> In order to show the first desired inequality on eigenvalues, we simply need to show that \((1-t)^{2n} t \leq 1/(4n)\) for any \(\in [0,1]\), which is the consequence of $$(1-t)^{2n} t \leq (e^{-t})^{2n} t \leq \frac{1}{2n} \sup_{u \geq 0} e^{-u} u = \frac{1}{2e n} \leq \frac{1}{4n}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Bounds on eigenvalues – II.</strong> In order to show the second desired inequality on eigenvalues, we simply need to show that \(( 1 – ( 1 – t)^{n+1}) \leq \sqrt{n+1} \sqrt{t}\), for any \(t \in [0,1]\). This is a simple consequence of the straightforward inequality \(( 1 – ( 1 – t)^{n+1}) \leq 1\) and the inequality \(( 1 – ( 1 – t)^{n+1}) \leq (n+1) t \), which itself can be obtained by integrating the inequality \((1-u)^n \leq 1\) between \(0\) and \(t\).</p></div>

<p>Longest common subsequence (LCS) and edit distance (ED) are fundamental similarity measures of interest to genomic applications (insertions/deletions/substitutions are a pretty good proxy for both mutations and read errors). The fastest known algorithms for computing the LCS/ED between two <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" />-character strings run in nearly quadratic time. Breakthroughs in fine-grained complexity <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0348">[BI18]</a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06022">[AHWW16]</a> from the last few years provide some nice formal barriers further progress: in particular, substantially faster algorithms would refute <em>NC-SETH</em>, the hypothesis that given an NC circuit with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> input bits,  deciding if the circuit has any satisfying assignment requires <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B%281-o%281%29%29n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="2^{(1-o(1))n}" class="latex" title="2^{(1-o(1))n}" /> time. (Note that this is a weaker, aka safer, hypothesis than the standard SETH.)</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Quantum algorithms for edit distance?</h2>
<p>One way to try to circumvent the computational barriers is by approximation algorithms (see my <a href="https://theorydish.blog/2018/07/20/approximating-edit-distance/">blog post</a>). A different approach is to go with quantum algorithms: Grover’s search can solve NC-SAT in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7Bn%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="2^{n/2}" class="latex" title="2^{n/2}" /> time. Even those of us less skeptic than <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/11/13/gils-collegial-quantum-supremacy-skepticism-faq/">Gil Kalai</a> can probably agree that quadratic quantum speedups won’t be practical anytime soon. But in theory, I find the question of whether we can design subquadratic quantum algorithms for edit distance very interesting (see also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04178">[BEG+18]</a>).</p>
<p>Alas, even with the power of quantum computers we don’t know any truly subquadratic algorithms for computing LCS/ED. On the other hand, it is not clear how to rule out even linear-time algorithms. A few weeks ago, Buhrman, Patro, and Speelman, posted a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05686">paper</a> that gives a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B3%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="n^{3/2}" class="latex" title="n^{3/2}" /> quantum <em>query complexity </em>lower bound for LCS/ED.</p>
<blockquote><p>Open Problem: Close the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B3%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="n^{3/2}" class="latex" title="n^{3/2}" /> vs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="n^2" class="latex" title="n^2" /> gap for quantum query complexity of ED/LCS.</p></blockquote>
<p>What is “query complexity” of ED/LCS? Buhrman et al. consider the following query model: In LCS, we want a <strong>maximum monotone matching</strong> between the characters of the two strings, where we can match two characters if they’re identical. Now suppose that in the query complexity problem we still want to find a maximum monotone matching, but instead of the character-equality graph (which is a union of disjoint cliques), we have an arbitrary bipartite graph, and <strong>given a pair of vertices, the oracle tells you if there is an edge between them</strong>.</p>
<p>This model may seem a bit counter-intuitive at first since the graphs may not correspond to any pair of strings; and indeed other models have been considered before <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=321922">[UAH76]</a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4033">[AKO10]</a>. But it turns out that this model is well-motivated by the NC-SETH lower bound (see discussion below).</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The ultimate hardness hypothesis</h2>
<p>What does the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B3%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="n^{3/2}" class="latex" title="n^{3/2}" /> query complexity lower bound mean for algorithms on actual strings? Instead of a black box oracle, our algorithms have access to an NC-circuit that implements it. Intuitively, we don’t know how to do very much with white box circuits, so it seems plausible to hypothesize that the running time will be lower bound by the query complexity. In some sense, this is a special case of the following <em>ultimate hardness hypothesis </em>that unifies a lot of the computational hardness assumptions that we like to assume but have no idea how to prove (e.g. P!=NP, P!=BQP, NC-SETH, FP!=PPAD, etc):</p>
<blockquote><p>[Ultimate Hardness Hypothesis] For every problem, the white-box computational complexity is lower bounded by the black-box query complexity.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In communication complexity similar statements are known and are called simulation/lifting theorems (see e.g. <a href="https://theory.stanford.edu/~mika/thesis.pdf">Mika’s thesis</a>). For computational complexity, there are obvious counter examples such as “decide if the oracle can be implemented by a small circuit”. So it only makes sense to continue to assume the ultimate hardness hypothesis for “reasonable problems” instead of “every problem”.</p>
<p>But Burhman et al. identify the following variant of the ultimate hardness hypothesis which I find very interesting. It is defined with respect to a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%3A%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5E%7B2%5En%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="T:\{0,1\}^{2^n} \rightarrow \{0,1\}" class="latex" title="T:\{0,1\}^{2^n} \rightarrow \{0,1\}" /> which takes as input the truth-table of a circuit and outputs True or False. Roughly, they hypothesize that:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Burhman et al.-QSETH, paraphrased] For <em>every</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" />, deciding if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" /> is true or false is as hard whether we’re given the actual circuit, or only the guarantee that the oracle is implemented by a small circuit”</p></blockquote>
<p>At a first read, I thought that arguments a-la impossibility of obfuscation <a href="https://www.iacr.org/archive/crypto2001/21390001.pdf">[BGI+01]</a> should refute this hypothesis, but a few weeks later I still don’t know how to prove it. Do you?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>A tip for the upcoming holidays</h2>
<p>During my postdoc, I worked on the quantum query complexity of ED/LCS with Shalev Ben-David, Rolando La Placa, and John Wright. I was a bit bummed to find out that we got scooped by Buhrman et al, but I know of at least 3 other groups that were also scooped by the same paper, so at least we’re in good company <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>At the time, a fellow postdoc from Psychology asked me what I was working on. I resisted the temptation to try to explain the various quantum variants of NC-SETH, and instead told him I was working on “DNA sequencing with quantum computers”. His reaction was priceless. Regardless of what you’re actually working on, try this line during the holidays when your relatives ask you about your work.</p>

<p class="justify-text">Following up my last post on Chebyshev polynomials, another piece of polynomial magic this month. This time, Jacobi polynomials will be the main players.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Since definitions and various formulas are not as intuitive as for Chebyshev polynomials, I will start by the machine learning / numerical analysis motivation, which is an elegant refinement of Chebyshev acceleration.</p>



<h2>Spectral measures and polynomial acceleration</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Like in the previous post, we consider the iteration in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) $$x_{k+1} = Ax_{k} – b,$$ with \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) a symmetric matrix with spectrum \({\rm Spec}(A) \subset (-1,1)\), with unique fixed point \(x_\ast\) such that \(x_\ast = A x_\ast – b\), that is, \(x_\ast = ( A – I)^{-1} b\).  These recursions naturally come up in gradient descent for quadratic functions or gossip algorithms (as described later).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to speed-up convergence, a classical idea explored in the <a href="https://francisbach.com/chebyshev-polynomials/">last post</a> is to take linear combinations of all past iterates. That is, we consider \(y_k = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k x_i\) for some weights \(\nu_i^k\) such that \(\sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k=1\) (so that if all iterates are already at \(x_\ast\), then the weighted average stays there). We have $$ y_k – x_\ast =  \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k ( x_i – x_\ast) = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k A^i (x_0-x_\ast) = P_k(A) (x_0-x_\ast),$$ where \(P_k(X) = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k X^i\) is a polynomial such that \(P_k(1)=1\).  </p>



<p class="justify-text">For Chebyshev acceleration, we used the following bound: $$  \frac{1}{n} \| y_k – x_\ast\|_2^2 =   \frac{1}{n} ( x_0 – x_\ast)^\top P_k(A)^2 (x_0 -x_\ast)   \leq \max_{\lambda \in {\rm Spec}(A)} |P_k(\lambda)|^2 \cdot \frac{1}{n}\|x_0 – x_\ast\|_2^2.$$ Using the fact that  \({\rm Spec}(A) \subset [-1\!+\!\delta,1\!-\!\delta]\) for some \(\delta&gt;0\), minimizing \(\max_{\lambda \in {\rm Spec}(A)} |P_k(\lambda)|^2\) subject to \(P_k(1)=1\) led to a rescaled Chebyshev polynomials. This allowed to go from a convergence rate proportional to \((1\!-\!\delta)^k\) to a convergence rate proportional to \((1 – \sqrt{2\delta})^k\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">When \(\delta\) is small, this is a significant gain. But when \(\delta\) is really small, none of the two techniques converge quickly enough, in particular in early iterations where the exponential convergence regime has not been reached. However, only a few eigenvalues are close to \(-1\) or \(1\)  (see examples in gossip matrices below), and using more information about eigenvalues beyond the smallest and largest ones can be advantageous.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="613" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/comparing_spectra-1-1024x266.png" class="wp-image-1600" height="159" />Histogram of eigenvalues of gossip matrices for gossiping within the 1D, 2D and 3D grid, with the same number of nodes \(n = 4096\): the eigengap \(1-\rho\) is small, and the eigenvalues are well-spread. See more details in the gossip section below.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We will use the spectral decomposition \(A = \sum_{i=1}^n\! \lambda_i u_i u_i^\top\), where \(\lambda_i\) is an eigenvalue of \(A\) with orthonormal eigenvectors \(u_i\), \(i=1,\dots,n\). We thus have $$  \frac{1}{n} \| y_k – x_\ast\|_2^2 = \frac{1}{n} ( x_0 – x_\ast)^\top P_k\Big( \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i u_i u_i^\top \Big)^2 ( x_0 – x_\ast) =  \frac{1}{n}\! \sum_{i=1}^n P_k(\lambda_i)^2 \big[ (x_0 – x_\ast)^\top u_i \big]^2.$$ Assuming \(\big[ (x_0 – x_\ast)^\top u_i \big]^2 \leq \tau^2\) for all \(i=1,\dots,n\) (that is, the initial deviation from the optimum has uniform magnitude on all eigenvectors), we need to minimize $$ e(P_k) = \frac{1}{n} \! \sum_{i=1}^n \! P_k(\lambda_i)^2  = \int_{-1}^1 \!\! P_k(\lambda)^2 d \sigma(\lambda)$$ with respect to \(P_k\), where \(d\sigma = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n\! \delta_{\lambda_i}\) is the spectral probability measure of \(A\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Now, the new goal is to minimize \(\displaystyle \int_{-1}^1 \!\! P_k(\lambda)^2 d \sigma(\lambda)\) with respect to a polynomial \(P_k\) with degree \(k\) and such that \(P_k(1)=1\). This is where orthogonal polynomials naturally come in. Their use in creating acceleration mechanisms dates back from numerical analysis in the 1980’s and 1990’s (with a very nice and detailed account in [1]).</p>



<h2>Orthogonal polynomials and kernel polynomials</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider a sequence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_polynomials">orthogonal polynomials</a> \(Q_k\) for the probability measure \(d\sigma\) in support within \([-1,1]\), each of degree \(k\), which we do not assume normalized. They are essentially unique (up to rescaling); see, e.g., the very good books by Gábor Szegő [2] and Theodore Seio Chihara [3].</p>



<p class="justify-text">We denote by \(\alpha_i = \int_{-1}^1 \! Q_i^2(\lambda)d\sigma(\lambda)\), for \(i \geq 0\), the squared norm of \(Q_i\), so that the sequence of polynomials \(({\alpha_i^{-1/2}} Q_i)\) is <em>orthonormal</em>. We can then solve the optimization problem above for \(P_k\), by writing it \(P_k(X) = \sum_{i=0}^k u_i {\alpha_i^{-1/2}} Q_i(X)\), and the problem in \(u \in\mathbb{R}^{k+1}\) becomes: $$\min_{u \in \mathbb{R}^{k+1}} \sum_{i=0}^k u_i^2 \mbox{ such that }  \sum_{i=0}^k u_i {\alpha_i^{-1/2}} Q_i(1) = 1.$$ This optimization problem can be solved in closed form, and the solution is such that \(\displaystyle u_i = \frac{{\alpha_i^{-1/2}} Q_i(1)}{\sum_{j=0}^k \!{\alpha_j^{-1}} Q_j(1)^2}\) for all \(i\), with the optimal polynomial $$P_k(X) =  \frac{\sum_{i=0}^k \! {\alpha_i^{-1}} Q_i(1) Q_i(X) }{\sum_{i=0}^k \!{\alpha_i^{-1}} Q_i(1)^2}.$$ The optimal value is thus equal to $$\big({\sum_{i=0}^k \alpha_i^{-1} Q_i(1)^2 } \big)^{-1}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The polynomials \(\sum_{i=0}^k \alpha_i^{-1} Q_i(X)Q_i(Y)\) are called the <em>kernel polynomials</em> [3, Chapter I, Section 7] associated to \(d\sigma\), and have many properties (beyond the optimality property which we just proved) that we will use below. </p>



<p class="justify-text">At this point, the problem seems essentially solved: one can construct iteratively the polynomials \(Q_k\) using classical second-order recursions for orthogonal polynomials, and thus compute \(P_k(X)\) which is proportional to \(\sum_{i=0}^k \frac{1}{\alpha_i} Q_i(1) Q_i(X)\). This leads however to a somewhat complicated algorithm, and some additional polynomial magic can be invoked.</p>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out that kernel polynomials, of which \(P_k\) is a special case, are themselves proportional to orthogonal polynomials for the modified measure \((1-\lambda) d \sigma(\lambda)\) (see proof at the end of the post). This is useful to generate the optimal polynomial with a second-order recursion.</p>



<p class="justify-text">To summarize, if we know the spectral measure \(d\sigma\), then we can derive a sequence of polynomials \(P_k\) that leads to an optimal value for \(\displaystyle \int_{-1}^1 \!\! P_k(\lambda)^2 d \sigma(\lambda)\). However, knowing precisely the spectral density is typically as hard as finding the fixed point of the recursion.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Since convergence properties are dictated by the behavior of the spectral measure around \(-1\) and \(1\), i.e., by the number of eigenvalues around \(-1\) and \(1\), we can model the spectral measure by simple distributions with varied behavior at the two ends of the spectrum. A known family is the rescaled Beta distribution, with density proportional to \((1-x)^\alpha (1+x)^\beta\). This will lead to Jacobi polynomials and “simple” formulas below.</p>



<h2>Jacobi polynomials</h2>



<p class="justify-text">For \(\alpha, \beta &gt; -1\), the \(k\)-th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_polynomials">Jacobi polynomial</a> \(J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}\) is equal to $$J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x) = \frac{(-1)^k}{2^k k!} (1-x)^{-\alpha} (1+x)^{-\beta} \frac{d^k}{dx^k} \Big\{ (1-x)^{\alpha + k} (1+x)^{\beta + k} \Big\}.$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">Denoting \(\displaystyle d\sigma(x) =   \frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)} ( 1 -x )^\alpha (1+x)^\beta dx\) the rescaled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution">Beta distribution</a> (with \(\Gamma(\cdot)\) the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function">Gamma function</a>), the Jacobi polynomials are orthogonal for the probability measure \(d\sigma\). That is, $$ \int_{-1}^1  \! J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x) J_\ell^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x) d\sigma(x) = 0, $$ if \(k \neq \ell\), and equal to \(\displaystyle \alpha_k = \frac{1}{2k+\alpha + \beta + 1} \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2) \Gamma(k+\alpha+1) \Gamma(k+\beta+1)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)  \Gamma(k+1) \Gamma(k+\alpha+\beta+1)}\) if \(k=\ell\). We have the following equivalent \( \displaystyle \alpha_k \sim \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1) }\frac{1}{2k}\) when \(k\) tends to infinity. All the formulas in these sections can be obtained from standard references on orthogonal polynomials [2, 3] (with a summary on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_polynomials">Wikipedia</a>) and are presented without proofs.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The value at 1 is an important quantity for acceleration, and is equal to: $$ J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}(1) = {k+\alpha \choose k} = \frac{\Gamma(k+\alpha+1)}{\Gamma(k+1) \Gamma(\alpha+1)} \sim \frac{ (k/e)^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)},$$ while the value at -1 is equal to $$ J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}(-1) =(-1)^k {k+\beta \choose k} = \frac{\Gamma(k+\beta+1)}{\Gamma(k+1) \Gamma(\beta+1)} \sim \frac{ (k/e)^\beta}{\Gamma(\beta+1)}.$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to compute the polynomials, the following recursion is key: $$  J_{k+1}^{(\alpha,\beta)}(X) = (a_k^{(\alpha,\beta)} X + \tilde{b}_k^{(\alpha,\beta)})J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)} – c_k J_{k-1}^{(\alpha,\beta)}(X),$$ with coefficients with explicit (and slightly complicated) formulas (in the case you wonder why I use \(\tilde{b}\) instead of \(b\), this is to avoid overloading the notation with the iteration \(x_{k+1}= Ax_{k}-b\)): $$a_k^{(\alpha,\beta)} =   \frac{(2k+\alpha+\beta+1)  (2k+2+\alpha+\beta)  }{(2k+2)(k+1+\alpha+\beta)  },\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $$ $$ \tilde{b}_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}  =   \frac{(2k+\alpha+\beta+1) ( \alpha^2 – \beta^2 )}{(2k+2)(k+1+\alpha+\beta) (2k + \alpha+\beta )},$$ $$c_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}  =\frac{ 2 (k+\alpha)(k+\beta)(2k +2+\alpha+\beta) }{(2k+2)(k+1+\alpha+\beta) (2k + \alpha+\beta )}.  $$ It can be started with \(J_0^{(\alpha,\beta)}(X) = 1\) and \(J_1^{(\alpha,\beta)}(X) = \frac{\alpha – \beta}{2} +\frac{ \alpha + \beta +2}{2} X\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The class of Jacobi polynomials includes many of other important polynomials, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials">Chebyshev polynomials</a> (\(\alpha = \beta = -1/2\)), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials">Legendre polynomials</a> (\(\alpha = \beta = 0\)) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gegenbauer_polynomials">Gegenbauer polynomials </a>(\(\alpha = \beta = d-1/2\)). Here are plots below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="387" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jacobi-1.gif" class="wp-image-1604" height="202" />Jacobi polynomials, as used for the acceleration of gossip algorithms in one-dimension, with \((\alpha,\beta) = (1/2,-1/2)\).</figure></div>



<h2>Jacobi acceleration</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We can now apply the polynomial acceleration technique above to the Beta distribution, that is for \(\displaystyle d\sigma(x) =   \frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)} ( 1 -x )^\alpha (1+x)^\beta dx\), we have:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Regular recursion error</strong> (no acceleration):  the error \(e(X^k) = \displaystyle \int_{-1}^1 \lambda^{2k} d\sigma(\lambda)\) is asymptotically equivalent to \(\displaystyle \frac{C_{\alpha,\beta}}{k^{\alpha+1}}+\frac{C_{\beta,\alpha}}{k^{\beta+1}}\), for some constants \(C_{\alpha,\beta}\) (see details at the end of the post). Before acceleration, there is thus an equivalent impact of the spectrum around \(-1\) and \(1\).</li><li><strong>Jacobi acceleration error</strong>: as shown at the end of the post, the error \(e(P_k)\) is equivalent to \(\displaystyle  \frac{E_{\alpha,\beta}}{k^{2\alpha+2}} \) for some constant \(E_{\alpha,\beta}\). </li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">What’s happening around \(-1\) and \(1\) is important, and particular the behavior around 1, and we thus see that \(\beta\) is less important for the accelerated version (in fact, using \(\beta=0\) to construct the Jacobi polynomial, as done in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>], leads to a similar acceleration). In particular, when considering distributions where \(\beta = \alpha\), then we see that Jacobi acceleration transforms a rate proportional to \(1/k^{\alpha+1}\) to a rate proportional to \(1/k^{2\alpha+2}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The final recursion is then equal to (see detailed computations at the end of the post): $$ y_{k+1} =  \frac{(2k\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta\!+\!2)   }{2(k\!+\!2\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta)(k\!+\!\alpha\!+\!2)  }  \big[ (2k\!+\!3\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta) (Ay_k-b) +  \frac{ (\alpha\!+\!1)^2\! -\! \beta^2  }{  2k \!+\! 1\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta }    y_k    \Big] \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  $$ $$\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  –  \frac{    (k+\beta)(2k +3+\alpha+\beta) }{ (k+2+\alpha+\beta) (2k + 1+\alpha+\beta )} \frac{ k }{ k+\alpha+2} y_{k-1}, $$ with initialization \(y_0=x_0\) and \(y_1 = \frac{\alpha+\beta+3}{2\alpha+4}(Ax_0 – b) + \frac{\alpha+1-\beta}{2\alpha+4}x_0\). For \(\alpha = \frac{d}{2}-1\) and \(\beta =0\), this exactly recovers the recursion from [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>].</p>



<h2>Application to gossip</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Like in the previous post we consider the gossip problem. For large grid graphs, the gap is small, equivalent to \(\frac{1}{2d} \frac{1}{n^{2/d}}\) for the \(d\)-dimensional grid. The gap is tending to zero with \(n\), and using acceleration techniques for non-zero gaps, such as Chebyshev acceleration, is not efficient for the earlier iterations.</p>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out that for grid graphs, the spectral measure tends to a limit with behavior \((1-x^2)^{d/2-1}\) around \(-1\) and \(1\). This is formerly true for the grid graph, and the behavior around 1 (which is the one that matters for acceleration) is the same for a large class of graphs with an underlying geometric structure [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>]. This thus corresponds to the Beta distribution of parameters \(\alpha = \beta = \frac{d}{2}-1\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Below, I consider gossiping on a chain graph with \(n=200\) nodes, and compare regular gossip with Chebyshev acceleration and Jacobi acceleration. In early iterations, Jacobi acceleration is much better. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="673" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gossip_jacobi_1D.gif" class="wp-image-1714" height="204" />Gossiping a one-dimensional white noise signal of length \(n = 200\), converging to its mean, which is zero. (left) regular gossip, (center) Chebyshev acceleration, (right) Jacobi acceleration</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">When looking at the convergence rate (plot below), for late iterations, the linear convergence of Chebyshev acceleration does take over; for a method that achieves the best of both world (good in early and late iterations), see [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>, Section 7].</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="441" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/gossip_jacobi_1D_double-1024x457.png" class="wp-image-1808" height="196" />Squared gossiping errors (norm between the signal and its average) in natural (left) and logarithmic (right) scale. Chebyshev acceleration is slow at the beginning, and faster at the end (once the error is already quite small).</figure></div>



<p>Similar plots may be made in two dimensions, gossiping a white noise signal, where the stationary behavior is observed much sooner for Jacobi acceleration. Here, Chebyshev acceleration performs worse than the regular iteration because the eigengap is very small (equal to \(6 \times 10^{-4}\)).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img width="663" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/gossip_jacobi_2D-1.gif" class="wp-image-1859" height="180" />Gossiping a two-dimensional white noise signal of size \(n = 64 \times 64 = 4096\), converging to its mean, which is zero. (left) regular gossip, (center) Chebyshev acceleration, (right) Jacobi acceleration.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">When gossiping a Dirac signal, we can also observe the spreading of information from the original position of the Dirac to the rest of the grid.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img width="661" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/gossip_jacobi_2D_diracs-1.gif" class="wp-image-1858" height="179" />Gossiping a two-dimensional Dirac signal of size \(n = 64 \times 64 = 4096\), converging to its mean.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I tried to move from the worst-case analysis of spectral acceleration which typically focuses on largest and smallest eigenvalues of the involved contracting operators, closer to an average-case analysis that takes into account the whole spectrum. This led to acceleration by Jacobi polynomials rather than Chebyshev polynomials. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Beyond gossip.</strong> While I have focused primarily on applications to gossip where the spectral measure can be well approximated, this can be extended to other situations. For example, Fabian Pedregosa and Damien Scieur [<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MSVk90bvK3m-GM1y-RirKdy_HRoJzZwV">5</a>] recently considered an application of polynomial acceleration to gradient descent for least-squares regression with independent covariates, where the spectral measure of the covariance matrix tends to the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marchenko%E2%80%93Pastur_distribution">Marchenko-Pastur</a> distribution (which is close to the rescaled Beta distributions above).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Jacobi polynomials beyond acceleration.</strong> In this post, I focused only on the acceleration properties of Jacobi polynomials. There are many more interesting applications of these polynomials in machine learning and associated fields. For example, their role in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics">spherical harmonics</a> to provide an orthonormal basis of the square-integrable functions on the unit sphere in any dimension, is quite useful for the theoretical study of neural networks (see, e.g., [<a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/14-546/14-546.pdf">6</a>] and references therein). I would typically say that this is a topic for another post, but this would be even more technical…</p>



<p class="justify-text">Next month, I will probably take a break in the polynomial magic series, and go back to less technical posts.</p>

<h2>Detailed computations</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Kernel polynomial as orthogonal polynomial</strong>. We consider a series \((R_k)\) of orthogonal polynomials for the measure \((1-\lambda) d\sigma(\lambda)\). Assuming that \(R_k \neq 0\) (see proof in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>, Appendix D]), then we show that the polynomial \(\frac{R_k(X)}{R_k(1)}\) is the optimal polynomial of degree \(k\) minimizing \(\int_{-1}^1 P^2(\lambda) d\sigma(\lambda)\) such that \(P(1)=1\). Indeed, taking any polynomial \(P\) of degree \(k\) and such that \(P(1)=1\), the polynomial \(P(X) \, – \frac{R_k(X)}{R_k(1)}\) vanishes at \(1\) and can thus be written as \(A(X)(X-1)\) with \(A(X)\) of degree equal or less than \(k-1\). Then we have: $$\! \int_{-1}^1 \! \! P(\lambda)^2 d\lambda = \! \int_{-1}^1\!\!   \frac{R_k(\lambda)^2}{R_k(1)^2}d\sigma(\lambda) + 2 \! \int_{-1}^1 \!\!  \frac{R_k(\lambda)}{R_k(1)} A(\lambda)(\lambda-1)d\sigma(\lambda)+ \! \int_{-1}^1  \!\! \! A(\lambda)^2(\lambda-1)^2 d\sigma(\lambda).$$ The second term in the right hand side is equal to zero by orthogonality of \((R_k)\), and the third term is non-negative. Therefore, we must have  \(\displaystyle \! \int_{-1}^1 \! \! P(\lambda)^2 d\lambda \geq  \! \int_{-1}^1\!\!   \frac{R_k(\lambda)^2}{R_k(1)^2}d\sigma(\lambda)\), which shows optimality.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Jacobi recursion</strong>. Given the original recursion \(x_{k+1} = A x_k – b\), we consider \(y_k = \frac{Q_k(A) ( x_0  – x_\ast)}{Q_k(1)} + x_\ast\), where \(Q_k = J_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)}\). We get: $$ y_{k+1} =  \frac{(a_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} A + b_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)})Q_{k}(A)( x_0  – x_\ast) – c_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} Q_{k-1}(A) ( x_0  – x_\ast)}{Q_{k+1}(1)} + x_\ast.$$ This leads to $$ y_{k+1} =  \frac{(a_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} A + b_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)})Q_{k}(1) (y_k – x_\ast) – c_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} Q_{k-1}(1) ( y_{k-1}  – x_\ast)}{Q_{k+1}(1)} + x_\ast.$$ Removing all terms in \(x_\ast\) (which have to cancel), we get: $$ y_{k+1} =  a_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} \frac{Q_{k}(1)}{Q_{k+1}(1)}(Ay_k-b) + \tilde{b}_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} \frac{Q_{k}(1)}{Q_{k+1}(1)}y_k –  c_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} \frac{Q_{k-1}(1)}{Q_{k+1}(1)}y_{k-1}. $$ Using the explicit formula for \(Q_{k}(1)\), we get after some calculations: $$ y_{k+1} =  \frac{(2k\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta\!+\!2)   }{2(k\!+\!2\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta)(k\!+\!\alpha\!+\!2)  }  \big[ (2k\!+\!3\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta) (Ay_k-b) +  \frac{ (\alpha\!+\!1)^2\! -\! \beta^2  }{  2k \!+\! 1\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta }    y_k    \Big] \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  $$ $$\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  –  \frac{    (k+\beta)(2k +3+\alpha+\beta) }{ (k+2+\alpha+\beta) (2k + 1+\alpha+\beta )} \frac{ k }{ k+\alpha+2} y_{k-1}, $$ with initialization \(y_0 = x_0\) and \(y_1 = \frac{\alpha+\beta+3}{2\alpha+4}(Ax_0 – b) + \frac{\alpha+1-\beta}{2\alpha+4}x_0\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Equivalents of performance</strong>. We first provide an equivalent of $$ \int_{-1}^1 \lambda^{2k} d\sigma(\lambda) = \frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)}\int_{-1}^1 \! x^{2k} (1-x)^\alpha(1+x)^\beta dx.$$ By splitting the sum in two, this is equivalent to $$ \frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)}\Big\{ 2^\beta\!\! \int_{0}^1 \! x^{2k} (1-x)^\alpha dx  + 2^\alpha \!\! \int_{0}^1 \! x^{2k}(1-x)^\beta dx \Big\},$$ leading to, using the normalizing factor of the Beta distribution, $$\frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)} \Big\{ 2^\beta\frac{\Gamma(\alpha+1)\Gamma(2k+1)}{\Gamma(\alpha+2k+2)} +2^\alpha\frac{\Gamma(\beta+1)\Gamma(2k+1)}{\Gamma(\beta+2k+2)}   \Big\}, $$ and finally to  $$ \displaystyle \frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)} \Big\{ 2^\beta\frac{\Gamma(\alpha+1) }{ (2k/e)^{\alpha+1} }  +2^\alpha\frac{\Gamma(\beta+1) }{ (2k/e)^{\beta+1} }    \Big\} ,$$ which is indeed of the form \(\displaystyle \frac{C_{\alpha,\beta}}{k^{\alpha+1}}+\frac{C_{\beta,\alpha}}{k^{\beta+1}}\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to estimate \(e(P_k)\), since \(P_k(X) = \sum_{i=0}^k \frac{1}{\alpha_i} Q_i(1) Q_i(X)\), we first need an equivalent of the term \(\displaystyle \frac{Q_i(1)^2}{\alpha_i^2} \sim \frac{(i/e)^{2\alpha}}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)^2} \Big( \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1) }\frac{1}{2i}\Big)^{-1} \sim E_{\alpha,\beta}’ i^{2\alpha+1}\), for some \(E_{\alpha,\beta}’\), leading to an error of the form \(e(P_k) \displaystyle \sim \frac{1}{ E_{\alpha,\beta}’  \sum_{i=0}^k i^{2\alpha+1}} \sim\frac{2\alpha+2}{ E_{\alpha,\beta}’} \frac{1}{k^{2\alpha+2}} \), which is of the desired form.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Spectral density of a grid</strong>. As seen at the far end of the <a href="https://francisbach.com/chebyshev-polynomials/">previous blog post</a>, the eigenvalues of \(A\) for the grid in one-dimension, with \(m=n\), is (up to negligible corrections) \(–  \cos \frac{k\pi}{m}\) for \(k =1,\dots,m\). This leads to a limiting spectral measure as \(– \cos \theta\) for \(\theta\) uniformly distributed on \([0,\pi]\). This leads to a spectral density \(\frac{1}{\pi}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\lambda^2}}\) supported on \([-1,1]\). In the plot below, we see that the histogram of eigenvalues for a finite \(m\) matches empirically this density.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="308" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1D_spectral_density.png" class="wp-image-1855" height="234" />Histogram of eigenvalues for 1D gossip matrix for \(m=4096\), with associated limiting spectral density.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">For a \(d\)-dimensional grid, with \(n = m^d\), the spectral density is the one of \(\frac{1}{d} (X_1+\cdots X_d)\) for \(X_i\) independent and distributed as \(\frac{1}{\pi}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\lambda^2}} d\lambda\) on \([-1,1]\), for each \(i=1,\dots,d\). This leads to a convolution power of the density above, rescaled to have support in \([-1,1]\). This can be shown to lead to behavior as \((1-\lambda^2)^{d/2-1}\) around \(1\) and \(-1\) (see [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>, Prop. 5.2]).</p></div>

<div><em><span>Size-free generalization bounds for convolutional neural networks</span></em></div>
<div></div>
<div>We prove bounds on the generalization error of convolutional networks. The bounds are characterized in terms of the training loss, the number of parameters, the Lipschitz constant of the loss, and the distance of the initial and final weights. The bounds are independent of the number of pixels in the input, as well as the width and height of hidden feature maps. These are the first bounds for DNNs with such guarantees.  We present experiments with CIFAR-10, varying hyperparameters of a deep convolutional network, comparing our bounds with practical generalization gaps.</div>

<p>Existing techniques for derandomizing algorithms based on circuit lower bounds yield a large polynomial slowdown in running time. We show that assuming exponential lower bounds against nondeterministic circuits, we can convert any randomized algorithm running in time T to a deterministic one running in time nearly T^2. Under complexity-theoretic assumptions, such a slowdown is nearly optimal.</p>
<p>In this talk I will concentrate on the role of error-correcting codes in those techniques. We will see which properties of error-correcting codes are useful for constructing pseudorandomness primitives sufficient for derandomization, where they came short of achieving better slowdown, and how we can overcome that.</p>

<div> There are many basic problems over sequences. For example, computing the edit distance between two sequences, detecting how RNA sequences fold, finding the distance between a sequence and a language (collection of sequences), understanding how disbalanced a parenthesis sequence is. They have natural applications in various areas including computational biology, natural language processing, compiler optimization, and data cleaning. The last few years have seen a plethora of results where new faster algorithms have been developed for these problems with various trade-offs between approximation (quality of solution) and running time (scalability). In this talk, I will present some of the tools that have been developed from my work related to these problems. Depending on time and audience choices, we will cover one or more of the following.</div>
<div></div>
<div>(i) A random walk based technique useful to measure how disbalanced a parenthesis sequence is, which has also been useful for streaming computation of edit distance.</div>
<div></div>
<div>(ii) A dependent rounding technique that gives nearly optimal result in nearly optimal time for estimating distance between a sequence and a language, which can also be used to speed up other polynomial time problems, such as the all pairs shortest path computation on graphs.</div>
<div></div>
<div>(iii) An amnesic dynamic programming technique that gives significantly faster approximation algorithm for RNA-folding, which can also be useful for many dynamic programming based problems that have Lipschitz property (most sequence problems have it).</div>
<div></div>
<div>(iv) An elimination of shortest path technique that gives sublinear time algorithms for estimating edit distance for certain regimes of edit distance.</div>

<p><em>Local Computation Algorithms</em></p>
<p>Consider a setting in which inputs to and outputs from a computational problem are so large, that there is not time to read them in their entirety.   However, if one is only interested in small parts of the output at any given time, is it really necessary to solve the entire computational problem? Is it even necessary to view the whole input? We survey recent work in the model of  “local computation algorithms” which for a given input, supports queries by a user to values of specified bits of a legal output.  The goal is to design local computation algorithms in such a way that very little of the input needs to be seen in order to determine the value of any single bit of the output. Though this model describes sequential computations, techniques from local distributed algorithms have been extremely important in designing efficient local computation algorithms. In this talk, we describe results on a variety of problems for which sublinear time and space local computation algorithms have been developed — we will give special focus to finding maximal independent sets and sparse spanning graphs.</p>

<p class="justify-text">Orthogonal polynomials pop up everywhere in applied mathematics and in particular in numerical analysis. Within machine learning and optimization, typically (a) they provide natural basis functions which are easy to manipulate, or (b) they can be used to model various acceleration mechanisms.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I will describe one class of such polynomials, the Chebyshev polynomials (Tchebychev in French, Чебышёв in Russian), whose extremal properties (beyond being orthogonal) are useful in the analysis of accelerated algorithms. </p>



<h2>Definition and first properties</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The \(k\)-th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials">Chebyshev polynomial</a> \(T_k\) is classically defined as the unique polynomial such that $$\forall  \theta \in [0,2\pi], \  \cos (k\theta) = T_k(\cos \theta).$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Recurrence</strong>. Summing the two equations \(\cos [(k\pm 1)\theta] = \cos (k\theta) \cos \theta \mp \sin (k\theta) \sin \theta\), the following recurrence relationship can be deduced: $$\forall k &gt;0, \ T_{k+1}(X) = 2X T_k(X) \, – T_{k-1}(X).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">Together with the first two polynomials \(T_0 (X) = 1\) and \(T_1(X) = X\), this leads to \(T_2(X) = 2X^2 – 1\), \(T_3(X) = 4X^3 – 3X\), and so on.</p>



<p class="justify-text">From the recurrence relationships, one can easily deduce that \(T_k\) has the parity of \(k\) and that \(T_k\) has degree \(k\), with leading coefficient \(2^{k-1}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Oscillatory behavior</strong>. For \(k\theta = j \pi\), for \(j\) integer, we have \(\cos (k \theta)=(-1)^j\), while when \(j\) goes from \(k\) to \(0\), \(\cos \theta = \cos\! \big( \frac{ j \pi}{k}\big)\) goes from -1 to 1. Thus, on \([-1,1]\), \(T_k(x)\) oscillates between \(-1\) and \(1\), with equality for \(\cos\! \big(  \frac{j \pi}{k} \big)\) for \(j = 0,\dots,k\). This oscillatory behavior is illustrated below and crucial for the extremal properties below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="306" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/chebyshev-3.gif" class="wp-image-1592" height="223" />First 33 Chebyshev polynomials, plotted between -1 and 1. Note the stronger oscillatory behavior between -1 and 1 as \(k\) grows.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Orthogonality</strong>. Using the orthogonality of the Fourier basis on \([0,2\pi]\), we have for \(k \neq \ell\),  \(\int_0^{\pi} \cos (k\theta) \cos (\ell\theta) d\theta=0\), and with the change of variable \(x = \cos \theta\), we obtain $$\int_{-1}^1 \frac{T_k(x) T_\ell(x)}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} dx = 0.$$ Thus the Chebyshev polynomials inherit from many properties from such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_polynomials">orthogonal polynomials</a> (such as the two-term recursion above, but for the Chebyshev polynomials, these can obtained more directly). For further properties, see [1].</p>



<h2>Extremal properties</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Chebyshev polynomials exhibit many “extremal properties”, of the form: among all polynomials of degree \(k\) with some form of normalization (e.g., fixed \(k\)-th order coefficient or value at given point), the one with smallest specific norm is proportional to \(T_k\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The most classical one is as follows: the polynomial \(P\) of degree \(k\) with \(k\)-th order coefficient equal to one, and with minimum \(\ell_\infty\)-norm \(\max_{ x \in [-1,1]} \! | P(x)|\) on \([-1,1]\), is \(P = \frac{1}{2^{k-1}}T_k\). The proof is particularly elegant and simple (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials">here</a>). Since this is not the property that we need for optimization, we will consider another one.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Proposition</strong> (<em>largest value outside of \([-1,1]\)</em>). For any polynomial \(P\) of degree \(k\) such that \(|P(x)| \leq 1\) for \(x \in [-1,1]\), and any \(z &gt; 1\), \(|P(z)| \leq T_k(z)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><em>Proof</em>. By contradiction, we assume that there exists \(z &gt; 1\) such that \(P(z)&gt;T_k(z)\) (the other possibility \(P(z) &lt; -T_k(z)\) is done by replacing \(P\) by \(-P\)). Without loss of generality, we can assume that \(\max_{x \in [-1,1]} |P(x) | &lt; 1\) (by potentially rescaling \(P\)). Then, the polynomial \(Q = P – T_k\) of degree \(k\) has alternatively strictly positive and negative values between \(-1\) and \(z&gt;1\). Indeed, \(Q(z) &gt; 0\), and \((-1)^j Q\big(\cos\! \big(\frac{j \pi}{k}\big)\big) &lt; 0 \) for all \(j = 0,\dots,k\). Therefore there are \(k+2\) alternating signs, and thus \(k+1\) zeros, which implies that \(Q=0\) since \(Q\) has degree \(k\). This is a contradiction with the existence of \(z\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that for any \(\theta\), \(T_k( \cosh \theta) = \cosh (k\theta)\) (which can be shown by induction), and \(T_k\) is thus increasing on \([1,+\infty)\) with values quickly increasing as \(k\) grows. See an illustration below.</p>

Note the exploding behavior as \(k\) grows.</figure></div>



<h2>Chebyshev acceleration</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider a recursion in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) of the form \(x_k = A x_{k-1} – b\), with \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) a symmetric matrix and eigenvalues in \([-\rho,\rho]\) with \(\rho \in [0,1)\). Such recursions are ubiquitous in data science, as (1) gradient descent on a strongly-convex quadratic function, or (b) gossip for distributed averaging [<a href="http://www.web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/gossip.pdf">2</a>] (see an example in a section below).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The recursion converges to the unique (because \(\rho \in [0,1)\)) fixed point \(x_\ast \in \mathbb{R}^n\) such that \(x_\ast =  A x_\ast – b\). We have, by unrolling the recursion: $$ x_k – x_\ast = A ( x_{k-1} – x_\ast) = A^k (x_0 – x_\ast).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">This leads to the usual exponential convergence rate \(\| x_k – x_\ast\|_2 \leq \rho^k \| x_0 – x_\ast\|_2\). In the following, writing \(\rho = 1 – ( 1-\rho)\) makes explicit the importance of \(1-\rho\), which is the gap between \(1\) and the largest eigenvalue of \(A\). Increasing this gap is equivalent to accelerating the convergence rate.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to speed-up convergence, a classical idea is to take linear combinations of all past iterates. That is, we consider \(y_k = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k x_i\) for some weights \(\nu_i^k\) such that \(\sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k=1\) (so that if all iterates are already at \(x_\ast\), then the weighted average stays there). We have $$ y_k – x_\ast =  \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k ( x_i – x_\ast) = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k A^i (x_0-x_\ast) = P_k(A) (x_0-x_\ast),$$ where \(P_k(X) = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k X^i\) is a polynomial such that \(P_k(1)=1\).  Therefore, we have: $$  \| y_k – x_\ast\|_2 \leq \max_{\lambda \in [-\rho, \rho]} |P_k(\lambda)| \cdot \|x_0 – x_\ast\|_2.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to select the best polynomial, we are looking for \(P_k\) such that \(P_k(1)=1\) and \(\max_{\lambda \in [-\rho,\rho]}\! |P_k(\lambda)|\) is as small as possible. Up to mapping \([-\rho,\rho]\) to \([-1,1]\), we know from the extremal property above that the optimal polynomial is exactly a rescaled Chebyshev polynomial, that is, $$P_k(X) = \frac{T_k(X/\rho)}{T_k(1/\rho)}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The maximal value on \([-\rho,\rho]\) is then \((T_k(1/\rho))^{-1}\). In order to compare to \(\rho^k\) (no acceleration), we can provide an equivalent of \([T_k(1/\rho)]^{-1/k}\) as \(\frac{\rho}{ 1+ \sqrt{1-\rho^2}}\) (see end of the post). There is no real acceleration when \(\rho\) is bounded away from 1, but as \(\rho\) tends to \(1\), this can be shown (see also the end of the post) to be equivalent to \(1 – \sqrt{2(1\!-\!\rho)}\), with the usual “square root” acceleration: \(1\!-\!\rho\) is essentially replaced by \(\sqrt{1\!-\!\rho}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We thus get an acceleration, but as is, computing \(y_k\) seems to require to store all values of \(x_1,\dots,x_k\), which is not practical. Since there is a second-order recursion for Chebyshev polynomials, one can derive one as well, directly for the sequence \((y_k)\).  A somewhat lengthy calculation (see end of the post) leads to the recursion $$ y_{k+1} = \omega_{k+1} ( Ay_{k} – b) + (1-\omega_{k+1}) y_{k-1}, $$<br />with a sequence \(\omega_{k+1}\) also defined by recursion as \(\omega_{k+1} = ( 1 – \frac{\rho^2}{4} \omega_k)^{-1}\), initialized with \(\omega_1 = 2\), \(y_0 = x_0\), \(y_1 = Ax_0 – b\). Therefore, on top of the usual computation of \(A y_k -b\), Chebyshev acceleration comes at no extra computational cost.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Simpler stationary recursion</strong>. In the recursion above, the parameter \(\omega_k\) varies with \(k\). A similar (then non totally optimal) acceleration can be obtained by replacing all \(\omega_k\)’s by their limit \(\omega\) when \(k\) tends to infinity, which is characterized by the equation \(\omega = ( 1-\frac{\rho^2}{4} \omega)^{-1}\) with smallest solutions \(\frac{ 1/\rho    – \sqrt{1/\rho^2 -1}}{\rho/2}\)  (see end of the post for detailed computations). The now stationary recursion then becomes $$ y_{k+1} = \omega ( Ay_{k} – b) + (1-\omega) y_{k-1}, $$ and is exponentially convergent with rate proportional to \(\rho \omega/2 =  \frac{1}{1/\rho + \sqrt{ 1/\rho^2 – 1}} = \frac{\rho}{1+ \sqrt{ 1 – \rho^2}}\). Thus, the recursion is simpler and the final speed asymptotically the same as full Chebyshev acceleration.</p>



<h2>Relationship with other acceleration mechanisms</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Non-adaptive schemes</strong>. As seen above for an affine operator \(F:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n\) (i.e., \(F(x) = Ax-b\)), Chebyshev acceleration takes a recursion of the form $$x_{k+1} = F(x_{k}),$$ and linearly combines iterates; it ends up creating second-order recursions of the form $$ y_{k+1} = \omega_{k+1} F(y_k) + (1-\omega_{k+1}) y_{k-1}, $$ with the same fixed points. Other formats (with fixed point preservation) can be considered such as $$ y_{k+1} = F(y_k) + \delta_{k+1}(y_k –  y_{k-1}),$$ or $$ y_{k+1} = F(y_k) + \delta_{k+1}(F(y_k) –  F(y_{k-1})), $$ for some constants \(\delta_{k+1}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">When \(F\) is affine, the format does not matter much (and all end up being essentially equivalent), but for gradient descent algorithms where \(F(x) = x – \gamma f'(x)\) for some non-quadratic function \(f\) and \(\gamma\) a step-size, there is a difference, the last one corresponding to Nesterov acceleration (see a nice post on it <a href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2014/03/06/nesterovs-accelerated-gradient-descent-for-smooth-and-strongly-convex-optimization/">here</a>), and the one before to classical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">momentum</a>, also known as the heavy-ball method (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.7457">3</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Adaptive schemes</strong>. The methods above need to know the bound on the spectrum \(\rho\). They have to commit to such a value (which is typically only known through upper bounds) and cannot “get lucky”, that is, even if the best value \(\rho\) is known, they cannot benefit from additional better properties of the spectrum of \(A\) (e.g., clustered eigenvalues). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method">conjugate gradient</a> method, which accesses the matrix \(A\) with the slightly stronger oracle of computing \(Ax\) any \(x\) (and not only \(Ax – b\)), or Anderson acceleration (which does not need a stronger oracle), are adaptive for similar problems [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/10078356X">4</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04133">5</a>]. Again, Chebyshev polynomials are present; probably more on this in future posts!</p>



<h2>Application to accelerated gossip</h2>



<p class="justify-text">A interesting linear recursion pops out in distributed optimization, where we assume that computers or processors are placed in \(n\) nodes in a network, and the goal is to minimize an average of function \(f_1,\dots,f_n\), each of them only accessible by the corresponding node. The nodes are allowed to communicate messages along each edge of a network. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="255" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2dgrid.png" class="wp-image-1367" height="221" />Two-dimensional grid with \(d = 8 \times 8 = 64\) nodes.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">The simplest of such problem is the network averaging problem where \(f_i(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} (\theta – \xi_i)^2\), for a uni-dimensional parameter \(\theta\) and \(\xi \in \mathbb{R}^n\). The solution of this consensus is \(\theta_\ast = \frac{1}{n} \! \sum_{i=1}^n \! \xi_i\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The gossip algorithm [<a href="http://www.web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/gossip.pdf">2</a>] consists in iteratively replacing the value \(\theta_i\) at a given node by a weighted average \(\sum_{j \sim i} W_{ij} \theta_j\) of the values at neighboring nodes (and node \(i\)). If all \(n\) nodes communicate simultaneously, then the vector \(\theta \) is replaced by \(W \theta\), hence a linear recursion $$ \theta_{k+1} = W \theta_{k},$$ initialized at \(\theta_0 = \xi\). Assuming that \(W\) is symmetric, with non-negative off-diagonal elements, and such that \(W 1_n = 1_n\) (where \(1_n \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is the vector of all ones), then all eigenvalues of \(W\) except the largest one are included in the interval \([-\rho, \rho]\), with \(\rho \in (0,1)\) for a connected graph. A simple such matrix \(W\) can be obtained from the adjacency matrix \(A\) of the graph, such that \(A_{ij} = 1\) if nodes \(i\) and \(j\) are connected, and zero otherwise, as \(W = I – \alpha L \), with \(L = {\rm Diag}(A 1_n) – A\) the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_matrix">Laplacian matrix</a> and \(\alpha\) selected so that the eigenvalues are all between \(-\rho\) and \(\rho\), except one, which is equal to 1 (see values of \(\rho\) and \(\alpha\) at the end of the post). We will see below that this extra eigenvalue which is equal to one is in fact not a problem for analyzing the convergence of this network averaging procedure.</p>



<p class="justify-text">When applying the gossip matrix \(W\) iteratively to \(\theta_0 = \xi\), the projection on the eigensubspace corresponding to the unit eigenvalue is not changed, while all other projections on the other eigensubspaces converge to zero at rate at most \(\rho^k\). Thus \(\theta_k\) converges to the constant vector \(\frac{1}{n} 1_n 1_n^\top \xi\) at rate \(\rho^k\), and thus to a constant vector, with the average \(\frac{1}{n} \! \sum_{i=1}^n \! \xi_i\) in all components.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Given that we have a linear recursion, we can use Chebyshev acceleration defined above and obtain substantial improvements, as illustrated below. For the use of this acceleration within distributed optimization algorithms, see [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01478317/document">6</a>] and references therein.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img width="696" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gossip_threeplots-3.gif" class="wp-image-1636" height="193" />Comparison of gossip algorithms on a two-dimensional grid (each cell correspond to a value \(\xi_i \in [-1,1]\) to average): (left) regular gossip, (center) accelerated second-order recursion with constant coefficients, (right) Chebyshev acceleration. Convergence is much faster with acceleration, (only) slightly better for Chebyshev acceleration, which is the optimal polynomial acceleration.</figure>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Among classical classes of orthogonal polynomials, Chebyshev polynomials are special, because beyond being orthogonal, they satisfy extremal properties that are particularly useful in numerical analysis.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In future posts, I plan to go over Jacobi polynomials (which include Legendre, Gegenbauer and Chebyshev polynomials), Hermite polynomials, and finally Bernoulli polynomials (which are not orthogonal but still very special). For all of these, there are natural applications in machine learning.</p>

<h2>Detailed Computations</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Limit of </strong>\([T_k(1/\rho)]^{-1/k}\). For \(z \geq 1\), then a well-known property of Chebyshev polynomials is that \(T_k(z) = \cosh [ k \, {\rm acosh} (z)]\) (which can be shown by induction using basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_function">hyperbolic trigonometry</a> identities). Moreover, we have \({\rm acosh} (z) = \log( z + \sqrt{z^2-1} )\) and thus $$T_k(z) = \frac{1}{2} \big[ \big( z + \sqrt{z^2-1} \big)^k + \big(z – \sqrt{z^2-1}\big)^k  \big].$$ For \(z = 1/\rho\), and taking limits, we get that \([T_k(z)]^{1/k}\) tends to \( z + \sqrt{z^2-1}\), which leads to the limit \(\frac{\rho}{ 1+ \sqrt{1-\rho^2}}\) for \([T_k(z)]^{-1/k}\). Then a classical Taylor expansion in \(1-\rho\) leads to \(1 – \sqrt{2(1-\rho)}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Recurrence for Chebyshev acceleration</strong>. We have, using the recursion for Chebyshev polynomials $$y_{k+1} – x_\ast = \frac{ 2 }{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)} (A/\rho) T_k(A/\rho) ( x_0 – x_\ast) \ – \frac{ 1  }{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)} T_{k-1}(A/\rho) ( x_0 – x_\ast).$$ Using the equality \(x_\ast = A x_\ast -b\), the terms in \(x_\ast\) cancel (they have to anyway, because \(P_k(1)=1\)). We then get $$y_{k+1}  = \frac{  (2/\rho) T_{k}(1/\rho)}{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)}  ( A y_k – b) \, – \frac{ T_{k-1}(1/\rho)  }{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)} y_{k-1}.$$</p>



<p>Using \(T_{k-1}(1/\rho) = (2/\rho) T_{k}(1/\rho) – T_{k+1}(1/\rho)\), and denoting \(\omega_{k+1} =  \frac{  (2/\rho) T_{k}(1/\rho)}{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)}\), we get $$y_{k+1} = \omega_{k+1} ( A y_{k} – b) + ( 1- \omega_{k+1}) y_{k-1}.$$ Reusing one last time the Chebyshev recursion, we get $$\omega_{k+1}^{-1} = \frac{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)}{  (2/\rho) T_{k}(1/\rho)}= 1 – \frac{T_{k-1}(1/\rho)}{  (2/\rho) T_{k}(1/\rho)} =1  – \frac{\rho^2}{4} \omega_{k},$$ which is the desired recursion.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Convergence of stationary recursion</strong>. The roots of \(\omega = ( 1-\frac{\rho^2}{4} \omega)^{-1}\) are the ones of \(\frac{\rho^2}{4} \omega^2 – \omega + 1 = 0\), with smallest solutions \(\omega = \frac{ 1/\rho   – \sqrt{1/\rho^2 -1}}{\rho/2}\). In order to study the second-order recursion $$ y_{k+1} = \omega ( Ay_{k} – b) + (1-\omega) y_{k-1}, $$ with constant coefficient, we need to compute the roots of \(r^2 = \omega \lambda r + (1-\omega)\), for \(|\lambda| \leq \rho\). The discriminant of this equation is \(\lambda^2 \omega^2 + 4 (1-\omega) \leq \rho^2 \omega^2 + 4(1-\omega) = 0\), and thus the roots are complex conjugate with squared modulus \((\omega\ – 1) = \frac{1}{4} \rho^2 \omega^2\) independent of \(\lambda\). Thus, as \(k\) tends to infinity, \(\| y_k  – x_\ast\|_2^{1/k}\) tends to \(\frac{1}{2} \rho \omega =   ( 1/\rho – \sqrt{ 1/\rho^2 – 1} ) = \frac{1}{1/\rho + \sqrt{ 1/\rho^2 – 1}}\), which is exactly the rate for Chebyshev acceleration.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of a square grid</strong>. Given a chain of length \(m\) such as depicted below, the \(m \times m\) Laplacian matrix can be shown (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05210">7</a>]) to have eigenvalues \(2 + 2 \cos \frac{k\pi}{m}\) for \(k =1,\dots,m\).</p>

<p class="justify-text">For a two-dimensional grid of size \(m \times m\), then the \(m^2 \times m^2\) Laplacian matrix can be shown (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05210">7</a>]) to have eigenvalues \(4 + 2\cos \frac{k_1\pi}{m} + 2\cos \frac{k_2\pi}{m}\) for \(k_1,k_2 =1,\dots,m\). Therefore, the second smallest eigenvalue is \(\lambda_\min = 2 – 2 \cos \frac{\pi}{m}\) and the largest eigenvalue is \(\lambda_\max = 4 + 4  \cos \frac{\pi}{m}\). We then select \(\alpha\) such that \(1-\alpha \lambda_\min = \rho\) and \(1-\alpha \lambda_\max = -\rho\), leading to \(\alpha = \frac{2}{\lambda_\min + \lambda_\max} = \frac{2}{6 + 2 \cos \frac{\pi}{m}}\) and finally \(\rho = \frac{\lambda_\max – \lambda_\min}{\lambda_\max + \lambda_\min} = \frac{2 +6  \cos \frac{\pi}{m} }{6 + 2 \cos \frac{\pi}{m}}\sim \frac{8 – 3 \frac{\pi^2}{m^2}}{8 –  \frac{\pi^2}{m^2}}\sim 1 – \frac{\pi^2}{4 m^2}\). Thus, as a function of \(n = m^2\), the eigengap is proportional to \(1/n\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">More generally, for the grid of size \(m\) in dimension \(d\), then we get \(\lambda_\min = 2 – 2 \cos \frac{\pi}{m}\) and \(\lambda_\max = 2d + 2d  \cos \frac{\pi}{m}\), and \(\rho = \frac{\lambda_\max – \lambda_\min}{\lambda_\max + \lambda_\min} = \frac{2d-2 +(2d+2)  \cos \frac{\pi}{m} }{2d+2 + (2d-2) \cos \frac{\pi}{m}}\sim \frac{4d – (d+1) \frac{\pi^2}{m^2}}{4d –  (d-1)\frac{\pi^2}{m^2}}\sim 1 – \frac{\pi^2}{2d m^2}.\) Thus, as a function of \(n = m^d\), the eigengap is proportional to \(1/n^{2/d}\). Moreover, when \(m\) is large, the normalizing factor \(\alpha\) tends to \(1/(2d)\).</p></div>

<p><em>by Naman Agarwal, Karan Singh and Elad Hazan, based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721">this paper</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05062">this paper</a>. </em></p>
<p>The mainstream thought in classical control operates under the simplifying principle that nature evolves according to well-specified dynamics perturbed by i.i.d. Gaussian noise, a field called <b>Optimal Control</b>. While this principle has proven very successful in some real world systems, it does not lend itself to the construction of truly <b>robust</b> controllers. In the real world one can expect all sorts of deviations from this setting, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inherent correlations between perturbations across time due to the environment.</li>
<li>Modeling misspecification, which can introduce unforeseeable, non-stochastic deviations from the assumed dynamics.</li>
<li>Completely adversarial perturbations introduced by a malicious entity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, in the world of classical supervised learning, the presence of the above factors has led to the adoption of <a href="https://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu/">online learning</a> in lieu of statistical learning, which allows for robust noise models and game-theoretic / strategic learning. A natural question arises: <i>what is the analogue of online learning and worst-case regret in robust control? </i></p>
<h2>Linear Dynamical Systems and Optimal Control</h2>
<p>Dynamical systems constitute the formalism to describe time-dependent, dynamic real-world phenomenon, ranging from fluid flow through a pipe, the movement of a pendulum, to the change of weather. The archetypal example here is a linear dynamical system, which permits a particularly intuitive interpretation as a (configurable) vector field (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system">wikipedia</a>):</p>
<p><img width="624" alt="" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null.png?w=624&amp;h=158" title="" height="158" /></p>
<p>A linear dynamical system (LDS) posits the state of a system evolves via the following dynamical relation:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bt%2B1%7D+%3D+Ax_t+%2B+Bu_t+%2B+w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x_{t+1} = Ax_t + Bu_t + w_t" class="latex" title="x_{t+1} = Ax_t + Bu_t + w_t" /></p>

<p>Here <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x_t" class="latex" title="x_t" /> represents the state of the system, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u_t" class="latex" title="u_t" /> represents a control input and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="w_t" class="latex" title="w_t" /> is a perturbation introduced to the dynamics, for the time step t. The vector fields above illustrate the behavior of the system for a few different choices of A, when the control input <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u_t" class="latex" title="u_t" /> is set to zero. The control inputs, when correctly chosen, can modify the dynamics to induce a particular desired behavior. For example, controlling the thermostat in a data center to achieve a particular temperature, applying a force to a pendulum to keep it upright, or driving a drone to a destination.</p>
<p>The goal of the controller is to produce a sequence of control actions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_1+%5Cldots+u_T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u_1 \ldots u_T" class="latex" title="u_1 \ldots u_T" /> aimed at minimizing the cumulative loss <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum_t+c_t%28x_t%2C+u_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\sum_t c_t(x_t, u_t)" class="latex" title="\sum_t c_t(x_t, u_t)" />. In classical control the loss functions are convex quadratics and known ahead of time. However, in the quest for more robust controllers, henceforth we will consider a broader class of general (possibly non-quadratic) convex cost functions, which may be adversarially chosen, and only be revealed online per-time-step to the controller.</p>
<h2>Previous notions: LQR and H-infinity control</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most fundamental setting in control theory is a LDS is with quadratic costs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="c_t" class="latex" title="c_t" /> and i.i.d Gaussian perturbations <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="w_t" class="latex" title="w_t" />. The solution known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear–quadratic_regulator">Linear Quadratic Regulator</a>, derived by solving the Riccati equation, is well understood and corresponds to a linear policy (i.e. the control input is a linear function of the state).</p>
<p>The assumption of i.i.d perturbations has been relaxed in classical control theory, with the introduction of a min-max notion, in a subfield known as <a href="https://stephentu.github.io/blog/h-infinity-control/2018/07/01/hinf-optimal-control-dynamic-games.html"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_%7B%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="H_{\infty}" class="latex" title="H_{\infty}" /> control</a>. Informally, the idea behind <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_%7B%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="H_{\infty}" class="latex" title="H_{\infty}" /> control is to design a controller which performs well against <i>all </i>sequences of bounded perturbations. There are two shortcomings of this approach; firstly computing such a controller can be a difficult optimization problem in itself. While a closed form for such a controller is known for linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, no such form is known when costs can be non-quadratic. Secondly and perhaps more importantly, the min-max notion is non-adaptive and hence often too pessimistic. It is possible that during the execution of the system, nature produces a <i>benign (predictable)</i> sequence of perturbations (say, for instance, the perturbations are, in truth, highly correlated). The <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_%7B%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="H_{\infty}" class="latex" title="H_{\infty}" /> controller in this setting could be overly pessimistic and lead to a higher cost than what could be achieved via a potentially more adaptive controller. This motivates our approach of minimizing regret, which we describe next.</p>
<h2>A less pessimistic metric: Policy regret</h2>
<p>Our starting point for more robust control is regret minimization in games. Regret minimization is a well-accepted metric in online learning, and we consider applying it to online control.</p>
<p>Formally, we measure the efficacy of a controller through the following notion of <i>policy </i>regret.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BRegret%7D+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bt%7D+c_t%28x_t%2C+u_t%29+-+%5Cmin_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bstable+%7D+K%7D+c_t%28x_t%28K%29%2C+-Kx_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\mathrm{Regret} = \sum_{t} c_t(x_t, u_t) - \min_{\mathrm{stable } K} c_t(x_t(K), -Kx_t)" class="latex" title="\mathrm{Regret} = \sum_{t} c_t(x_t, u_t) - \min_{\mathrm{stable } K} c_t(x_t(K), -Kx_t)" /></p>
<p>Here in, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t%28K%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x_t(K)" class="latex" title="x_t(K)" /> represents the state encountered when executing the linear policy $K$. In particular, the second term represents the total cost paid by the best(in hindsight) stable linear policy had it executed in the system facing the same sequence of perturbations as the controller. In this regard the above notion of regret is <b>counterfactual</b> and hence more challenging than the more common stateless notion of regret.<br />
(Remark: a <span style="font-weight: 400;">stable linear policy K is one which ensures that the spectral radius of  A-BK is strictly less than one. For a formal quantitative definition, please see the </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721"><span style="font-weight: 400;">paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p>Furthermore, the choice of comparing to a linear policy is made keeping tractability in mind. Note that this nevertheless generalizes the standard Linear Quadratic Regulator and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H_%7B%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="H_{\infty}" class="latex" title="H_{\infty}" /> control on Linear Dynamical Systems, as the optimal choice of controllers in those settings is indeed a linear policy (if the cost functions are quadratic, our setting allows more general loss functions).</p>
<p>Algorithms which achieve low regret on the above objective are naturally adaptive as they perform as well as the best controller (upto a negligible additive regret) oblivious to whether the sequence is <i>friendly </i>or <i>adversarial. </i></p>
<h2>A new type of controller</h2>
<p>In successive recent works (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721">[1] </a>and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05062">[2]</a>), we show that the above notion of policy regret is tractable and can be sublinear (even logarithmic under certain conditions). Using a new parameterization for controller that we detail next, we obtain the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Robustness to Adversarial Perturbations (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721">[1]</a>) – </b>For arbitrary, but bounded, perturbations $w_t$, which may even be chosen adversarially, we provide an efficient algorithm that achieves regret of <b><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BT%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="O(\sqrt{T})" class="latex" title="O(\sqrt{T})" /></b>.</li>
<li><b>Fast Rates under Stochastic Perturbations (</b>[2]<b>) – </b>Further, for strongly convex costs, and i.i.d. perturbations, we give an efficient algorithm with a poly-logarithmic (in T) regret guarantee.</li>
</ul>
<p>The former result is the first such result to establish vanishing average regret in an online setting for control with adversarial perturbations. The latter result offers a significant improvement over the work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07104">Cohen et al. </a>who established a rate of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BT%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="O(\sqrt{T})" class="latex" title="O(\sqrt{T})" /> in a similar (stochastic) setting.</p>
<p>We assume that the dynamical system i.e. (A,B) is completely known to us and the state is fully observable. These assumptions have been eliminated in further work with our collaborators, and will be a subject of a future blog post. We now describe the core ideas which go into achieving both our results.</p>
<h2>The Gradient Perturbation Controller</h2>
<p>Consider how the choice of the linear controller determines the control input.</p>
<p><img width="624" alt="" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-1.png?w=624&amp;h=120" title="" height="120" /></p>
<p>The above display demonstrates that the action, state, and hence the cost are <b>non-convex</b> functions of the linear controller K. The first piece of our result evades this lack of convexity by over-parametrization, ie. relaxing the notion of a linear policy as described next.</p>
<p>In place of learning a direct representation of a linear controller K, we learn a sequence of matrices <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_1%2C+M_2+%5Cldots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="M_1, M_2 \ldots " class="latex" title="M_1, M_2 \ldots " /> which represent the dependence of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u_t" class="latex" title="u_t" /> on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_%7Bt+-+i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="w_{t - i}" class="latex" title="w_{t - i}" /> under the execution of some linear policy. Schematically, we parameterize our policy as follows</p>
<p><img width="624" alt="" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-2.png?w=624&amp;h=62" title="" height="62" /></p>
<p>Note that, the assumption that the dynamics is known permits the exact inference of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="w_t" class="latex" title="w_t" />’s and thereby making the execution of such a controller possible. While the choice of the controller ensures that control inputs are linear in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BM_i%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\{M_i\}" class="latex" title="\{M_i\}" />, the superposition principle for linear dynamical systems ensures that the state sequence too is linear in the same variables. Therefore, the cost of execution of such a controller parameterized via <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BM_i%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\{M_i\}" class="latex" title="\{M_i\}" /> is convex and we can hope to learn them using standard techniques like Gradient Descent. Observe that, by construction, it is possible to emulate the behavior any linear controller K by a suitable choice of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BM_i%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\{M_i\}" class="latex" title="\{M_i\}" />’s.</p>
<p>There are two barriers though. First, the number of parameters grows with time $T$ and so can regret and running time. Secondly, since there is a state, the decision a controller makes at a particular instance affects the future. We deal with these two problems formally in the paper and show how they may be circumvented. One of the important techniques we use is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6937">Online Convex Optimization with Memory</a>.</p>
<p>With all the core components in place, we provide a brief specification of our algorithm. Let’s fix some memory length H, and a time step t. Define a proxy cost as</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_t%28M_1%2C+%5Cldots+M_H%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="c_t(M_1, \ldots M_H)" class="latex" title="c_t(M_1, \ldots M_H)" /> =</p>

<p>The algorithm now as suggested by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6937">Anava, Hazan and Manor</a>, is to take a gradient step on the above proxy.</p>

<p>The above algorithm achieves <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BT%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="O(\sqrt{T})" class="latex" title="O(\sqrt{T})" /> regret against <b>worst-case</b> noise. For the full proof and the precise derivation of the algorithm, check out the paper.</p>
<h2>Achieving Logarithmic Regret</h2>
<p>Algorithms for (state-less) online learning often enjoy logarithmic regret guarantees in the presence of strongly convex loss functions. Prima facie, one could hope that for dynamical systems with strongly convex costs, such a stronger regret guarantee would hold. The cautionary note here is that <b>strong convexity of the cost <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_t%28x_t%2C+u_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="c_t(x_t, u_t)" class="latex" title="c_t(x_t, u_t)" /> in the control input does not imply strong convexity in the controller representation</b>.,</p>
<p>In fact, the strong convexity of our proxy cost function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%28M_1%2C+%5Cldots+M_H%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="c(M_1, \ldots M_H)" class="latex" title="c(M_1, \ldots M_H)" /> in its natural parameterization over M’s is further hindered by the fact that the space of M’s constitutes a highly over-parametrized representation (say, vs. K). Indeed in the case of adversarial perturbations, it is easy to construct a case where the strong convexity does not transfer over from the control to the controller.</p>
<p>In a future blog post we detail how this technical difficulty can be overcome using the natural gradient method, giving rise to a logarithmic regret algorithm for control.</p>
<h2>Experimental Validation</h2>
<p>Below we provide empirical evaluations of the GPC controller in various scenarios, demonstrating it is indeed more robust to correlated noise than previous notions. <b>(All the plots below are produced by a new research-first control and time series library in the works — Alpha version scheduled to be released soon! STAY TUNED!!!) </b></p>
<p>To start, let’s reproduce the classical setting of controlling an LDS with i.i.d. Gaussian noise. Here, the LQR program is <i>optimal</i>. Yet, the plot below attests that our new control methodology offers a slightly suboptimal, yet comparable, performance. This observation also underlines the message the the proposed controller tracks the optimal controller without any foreknowledge of the structure of the perturbations. Here, for example, GPC is not made aware of the i.i.d. nature of the perturbations.</p>
<p><img width="624" alt="" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-4.png?w=624&amp;h=205" title="" height="205" /></p>
<p>Moving on to correlated perturbations across time, a simple such setting is when the perturbations are drawn from a Gaussian Random Walk (as opposed to independent Gaussians). Note that here it is possible to derive the <i>optimal </i>controller via the separation principle. Here is the performance plot:</p>
<h1><img width="624" alt="" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-5.png?w=624&amp;h=205" title="" height="205" /></h1>
<p>Note that the default LQR controller performs much worse, where as GPC is able to track the performance of the optimal controller quite closely. Next up, <b>sinusoidal noise</b>:</p>
<p><img width="624" alt="" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-6.png?w=624&amp;h=205" title="" height="205" /></p>
<p>Here the full power of regret minimization is exhibited as the consecutive samples of the sine function are very correlated, yet predictable. GPC vastly outperforms LQR as one would expect. But, is this fundamentally a hard setting? What would happen if we use the H-infinity controller, or, god forbid, no control at all? We see this in the next plot (on the log-linear scale):</p>
<p><img width="624" alt="" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/null-7.png?w=624&amp;h=202" title="" height="202" /></p>
<h1>What’s next?</h1>
<p>We have surveyed a new family of controls that are fundamentally different than classical optimal control: they are adaptive and attain regret guarantees vs. adversarial noise. Their preliminary experimental tests seem quite promising.</p>
<p>In the coming posts we will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explain how GPC can obtain the first logarithmic regret in the tracking/Kalman setting,</li>
<li>Reveal our new research-first library for control / time-series prediction,</li>
<li>Tackle more general settings.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Stay tuned! Preferably using the GPC… <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /></h1>

<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from 
<a class="entryheader" href="https://francisbach.com" title="Machine Learning Research Blog">Francis Bach</a>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p class="justify-text">The word “kernel” appears in many areas of science (it is even worse in French with “noyau”); it can have different meanings depending on context (see <a href="http://jeff560.tripod.com/k.html">here</a> for a nice short historical review for mathematics).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Within machine learning and statistics, kernels are used in two related but different contexts, with different definitions and some kernels like the beloved and widely used Gaussian kernel being an example of both. This has been and still is a source of confusion that I would like to settle for good with this post! In particular, these two types of kernels have different properties regarding their resistance (or lack thereof) to the curse of dimensionality.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Throughout this post, for simplicity, I will assume that data live in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), noting that most concepts can be extended to any space (e.g., images, graphs, etc.): this is the beauty of the (positive-definite) kernel trick but this is for another post. </p>



<p class="justify-text">I will consider a kernel function \(k\), which is a real-valued function defined on \(\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d\). I will always assume that the kernel \(k\) is <strong>symmetric</strong>, that is, \(k(x,y) = k(y,x)\) for any \(x,y \in \mathbb{R}^d\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">An important object of study will be the <strong>kernel matrix</strong> \(K \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) obtained from \(n\) observations \(x_1,\dots,x_n \in\mathbb{R}^d\), which is defined through $$K_{ij} = k(x_i,x_j).$$ Given the symmetry assumption on \(k\), it will be a symmetric matrix (hence with real eigenvalues).</p>



<p class="justify-text">I will now present the two types of kernels, (1) <strong>non-negative</strong> kernels and (2) <strong>positive-definite</strong> kernels. For kernels of the form \(k(x,y) = q(x-y)\) for a function \(q: \mathbb{R}^d \to\mathbb{R}\), the two definitions will correspond to (1) \( q \) has non-negative values, and (2) the <em>Fourier transform</em> of \(q\) has non-negative values. This leads to different types of algorithms that I now present.</p>



<h2>I. Non-negative kernels</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Definition</strong> (<em>non-negative kernels</em>). A kernel \(k: \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\) is non-negative, if $$\forall x,y \in \mathbb{R}^d, \ k(x,y) \geq 0.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">An equivalent definition is that all kernel matrices have non-negative elements. The explicit terminology <em>pointwise</em> non-negativity is sometimes used.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The most classical example is the Gaussian kernel, defined as $$k(x,y) =  \exp\Big( -\frac{1}{2 \sigma^2} \| x – y\|_2^2\Big),$$ where \(\| z\|_2^2 = \sum_{i=1}^d z_i^2\) is the squared \(\ell_2\)-norm (I have not added any normalizing constant because most algorithms ignore it). Other examples are shown below for \(d=1\).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img width="759" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/windows-1024x229.png" class="wp-image-1024" height="169" />Various kernels plotted at \(y = 0\): Gaussian kernel \(\exp\big( – \frac{1}{2\sigma^2} (x-y)^2\big)\), Exponential kernel \(\exp\big( – \frac{1}{\sigma} |x-y|\big)\), Cauchy kernel \(\frac{1}{1+(x-y)^2 / \sigma^2}\), and triangular kernel \(\max \big\{ 0, 1 – \frac{|x-y| }{2 \sigma} \big\}\).</figure>



<p class="justify-text"> There are many more choices (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(statistics)#Kernel_functions_in_common_use">here</a>), but the functions below all also have a non-negative Fourier transform, which will make them also a member of the other class of kernels (see the second part of the post). </p>



<h3>Kernel smoothing (a.k.a. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_regression">Nadaraya-Watson estimator</a>)</h3>



<p class="justify-text">This is a version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation">kernel density estimation</a> for supervised problems, which for simplicity I will describe with real-valued outputs (it can directly be extended to any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model">generalized linear model</a> to tackle other types of outputs). Given \(n\) observations \((x_i,y_i) \in \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}\), \(i=1,\dots,n\), the goal of kernel smoothing is to estimate a function \(\hat{f}: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\) that can predict \(y\) from \(x\). It is defined at any test point \({x} \in \mathbb{R^d}\): $$\hat{f}(x) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n k(x,x_i) y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n k(x,x_i)}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">See an illustrative example below in one dimension for the Gaussian kernel. The non-negativity of the kernel is important to make sure the denominator above is positive.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="500" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/nadaraya-2-1024x447.png" class="wp-image-988" height="218" />Nadaraya-Watson estimation. Left: function \(f\), with noisy observations \(y_i = f(x_i) + \varepsilon_i\). Right: kernel regression estimate \(\hat{f}\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Algorithms</strong>. In terms of computational complexity, computing \(\hat{f}(x)\) for a single \(x\) takes naively time \(O(n)\) to go through the \(n\) data points, but efficient indexing techniques such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree">k-d trees</a> can be used to reduce this cost when \(d\) is not too large. The vector of prediction \(\hat{y}\) for the \(n\) observations, can be obtained as $$ \hat{y} = {\rm Diag}(K 1_n)^{-1} K y .$$ The complexity is \(O(n^2)\) but can also be made linear in \(n\) (in particular when the kernel matrix is in addition positive semi-definite, i.e., when the kernel is both non-negative and positive-definite).</p>



<p class="justify-text">It is important to note that the only free parameter is the bandwidth \(\sigma\), while there will be an extra regularization parameter for positive definite kernels.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Choice of bandwidth</strong>. As illustrated below, for kernels of the form \(k(x,y) = q\big( \frac{x-y}{\sigma} \big)\), like the Gaussian kernel, the choice of the <em>bandwidth</em> parameter \(\sigma\) is crucial.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="257" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/nadaraya.gif" class="wp-image-989" height="228" />Varying \(\sigma\) from small (leading to overfitting when \(\sigma\) is too small) to large (leading to underfitting when \(\sigma\) is too large).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Note here that when \(\sigma\) tends to zero, then the estimated function \(\hat{f}\) interpolates the data (but without any wild behavior between input observations), while when \(\sigma\) grows, the function \(\hat{f}\) tends to a constant. We now consider only these translation-invariant kernels.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Statistical properties</strong>. Kernel smoothing is a simple instance of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonparametric_statistics">non-parametric</a> estimation procedure, that can in principle adapt to any underlying function \(f\) that generated the outputs (after additive noise is added, so that the observations are \(y_i = f(x_i) + \varepsilon_i\), with \(\varepsilon_i\) being zero-mean). This estimator is commonly used in low dimensions (e.g., \(d\) less than \(10\) or \(20\)). In higher dimensions however, it suffers from the <em>curse of dimensionality</em> common to most methods based on non-negative kernels.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Consistency and curse of dimensionality</strong>. Kernel regression is one instance of local averaging techniques such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm">k-nearest-neighbors</a>, where for any test point \(x\), the outputs \(y_i\) corresponding to inputs \(x_i\) which are closer to \(x\) are given higher weights. For simplicity, I will only consider the kernel \(k(x,y) = 1_{\| x – y\|_\infty \leq \sigma}\) where \(\| z\|_\infty = \max\{ |z_1|,\dots,|z_d|\}\) is the \(\ell_\infty\)-norm of \(z\). The discussion below extends with more technicalities to all translation-invariant kernels.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="389" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/filling_space_cube-3.png" class="wp-image-1086" height="178" />\(n=11\) observations in dimension \(d=2\), with a test point \(\hat{x}\). Only three observations within distance \(\sigma\) in \(\ell_\infty\)-norm are counted for computing \(\hat{f}(x)\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">In order to obtain a <em>consistent</em> estimator \(\hat{f}\) that converges to the true underlying function \(f\) when \(n\) tends to infinity, the bandwidth \(\sigma\) should depend on \(n\) (and hence denoted \(\sigma_n\)), with two potentially conflicting goals:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><em>Vanishing bias</em>: The bandwidth \(\sigma_n\) should be small enough so that the underlying function \(f\) does not vary much in a ball of radius \(\sigma_n\) around \(x\). When \(f\) is assumed Lipschitz-continuous, the deviation is proportional to \(\sigma_n\). Therefore, the error in estimating \(f\) is proportional to \(\sigma_n\) and we thus need $$ \sigma_n \to 0.$$ </li><li><em>Vanishing variance</em>: Since the observations \(y_i = f(x_i) + \varepsilon_i\) are noisy, around some test point \(\hat{x}\), we need to average sufficiently many of them so that the noise is averaged out, that is, for any test point \(\hat{x}\), the number of observations that are in a ball of radius \(\sigma_n\) should tend to infinity with \(n\). With a simple covering argument, this requires (at least) $$ n \sigma_n^d \to +\infty.$$ This illustrated below for the specific kernel I chose, which is based on the \(\ell_\infty\)-norm.</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="456" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/covering_cube-2.png" class="wp-image-1093" height="211" />Assuming the support of the distribution of inputs is an \(\ell_\infty\)-ball of radius \(1/2\) in dimension \(d=2\), then with \(\sigma_n = 1/8\), in order to have a consistent estimation for each of the \((2\sigma_n)^{-d} = 16\) candidate test points \(\hat{x}_1,\dots,\hat{x}_{16}\), the number of points in each of the \(m = (2\sigma_n)^{-d}\) balls has to grow unbounded and thus \(n/m = n (2\sigma_n)^{d}\) has to grow unbounded.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Therefore,  in order to obtain a consistent estimator, the bandwidth of translation-invariant kernels has to go to zero slowly enough, slower than \(n^{-1/d}\), and the final estimation error is converging to zero, but slower than \(n^{-1/d}\).  This is the usual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality">curse of dimensionality</a>: in order to obtain a certain error \(\epsilon\), the number of observations has to grow at least as \(\epsilon^{-d}\), and thus exponentially in dimension. When the underlying function has weak smoothness properties (here just Lipschitz-continuous), such a dependence in \(d\) is provably unavoidable in general [1, 2].</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Resistance to the curse of dimensionality</strong>. If the true function \(f\) happens to be more regular (i.e., with bounded higher order derivatives), kernel smoothing cannot adapt to it, that is, the rates of convergence still have the bad dependence on \(d\), while other techniques can have an improved dependence, such as positive-definite kernel methods below, or improved local averaging techniques based on local polynomials [1, 2].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that since the curse of dimensionality comes primarily from a covering argument of the input space, if the distribution of inputs is supported on a low-dimensional manifold, the dependence in \(d\) can be replaced by the same dependence, but now in the dimension of the manifold (see, e.g., [<a href="https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.lnms/1196794952">7</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Kernel smoothing is one particular instance of methods based on negative-kernels. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation">kernel density estimation</a> is also commonly used. Spectral methods for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_clustering">clustering</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_dimensionality_reduction">non-linear dimensionality reduction</a>, and Laplacian-based semi-supervised learning [<a href="https://www.aaai.org/Papers/ICML/2003/ICML03-118.pdf">8</a>], also use non-negative kernels, with similar conditions on the bandwidth \(\sigma\) (see [<a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume8/hein07a/hein07a.pdf">3</a>]) and similar curses of dimensionality.</p>



<p>I now turn to the other type of kernels.</p>



<h2>II. Positive-definite kernels</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Definition</strong> (<em>positive-definite kernels</em>). A kernel \(k: \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\) is positive-definite, if for any finite set of elements \(x_i,\dots,x_n\) in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), the kernel matrix is positive-semidefinite (that is, all its eigenvalues are non-negative).</p>



<p>The classical examples are:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><em>Polynomial kernels</em>: \(k(x,y) = (x^\top y)^r\) for \(r\) a positive integer.</li><li><em>Translation-invariant kernels</em>: they are of the form \(k(x,y) = q(x-y)\) for a function \(q: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\) with a (pointwise) <strong>non-negative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier transform</a></strong>, which is equal to\(\displaystyle \hat{q}(\omega) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \! \! q(x) e^{-i \omega^\top x} dx\), and assumed to exist. For these, we see a clear distinction between non-negative kernels of that form, for which \(q\) (and not \(\hat{q}\)) has to have non-negative elements (note that all examples given at the beginning of the post are both, and that there are two hidden Fourier transform pairs).</li><li><em>Kernels on structured objects</em>: when the observations are not vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), such as graphs, trees,  measures, on in fact any objects, specific kernels can be designed with nice properties and many applications, see, e.g., [4].</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text"></p>



<h3>Kernel trick and representer theorem</h3>



<p class="justify-text">The key consequence of positive-definiteness (with surprisingly no other assumptions needed regarding \(k\)) is the existence of an (essentially unique) Hilbert space \(\mathcal{F}\), called the <em>feature space</em>, and a function \(\Phi: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathcal{F}\), called the <em>feature map</em>, such that $$\forall x,y \in \mathbb{R}^d, \ k(x,y) = \langle \Phi(x), \Phi(y) \rangle_\mathcal{F}.$$ This is non-trivial to show and due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_space">Aronszajn and Moore</a> in the 1950s.</p>



<p class="justify-text">From a positive-definite kernel, it is to common to define the space of functions \(f\) which are linear in the feature vector \(\Phi\), that is, of the form \(f(x) = \langle w, \Phi(x) \rangle_{\mathcal{F}}\), for a certain \(w \in \mathcal{F}\). When minimizing an empirical risk on \(n\) observations \(x_1,\dots,x_n \in \mathbb{R}^d\), regularized by the norm \(\| w\|_\mathcal{F}\), the celebrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representer_theorem">representer theorem</a> (which is a direct consequence of Pythagoras’ theorem) states that \(w\) is of the form \(w = \sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_j \Phi(x_j)\), and thus \(f\) is of the form $$f(x) = \sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_j \langle \Phi(x), \Phi(x_j) \rangle_\mathcal{F} =  \sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_j k(x,x_j),$$ for a certain vector \(\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^n\).</p>



<h3>Regularization through positive-definite kernels</h3>



<p class="justify-text">Given the function \(f\) defined as \(f(x) =  \langle w, \Phi(x) \rangle_{\mathcal{F}}\), the regularizer \(\| w\|_\mathcal{H}\) defines a regularization on the prediction function \(f\). This is a key property of positive-definite kernels: they lead to an <em>explicit</em> regularization \(\Omega(f)^2\) on the prediction function (this in fact defines a Hilbert space of functions, which is often referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_space">reproducing kernel Hilbert space</a>).</p>



<p class="justify-text">For the translation-invariant kernels \(k(x,y) = q(x-y)\), it happens to be equal to (see [4]) $$ \Omega(f)^2 =\frac{1}{(2\pi)^d} \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \!\! \frac{|\hat{f}(\omega)|^2 }{\hat{q}(\omega)} d\omega,$$ where \(\hat{f}\) and \(\hat{q}\) are the Fourier transforms of \(f\) and \(q\). For example, for \(d=1\) and the exponential kernel \(q(x-y) = \exp(-|x-y|/\sigma)\), we have \(\hat{q}(\omega) = 2 \sigma / ( 1 + \sigma^2 \omega^2)\), and \(\displaystyle \Omega(f)^2= \frac{1}{2\sigma} \int_{\mathbb{R}} \! |f(x)|^2 dx +\frac{ \sigma}{2} \int_{\mathbb{R}}\! |f'(x)|^2 dx \), which is a squared <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobolev_space">Sobolev norm</a> (this extends to higher dimensions as well).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In addition, for the Gaussian kernel \(q(x-y) = \exp \big(-(x-y)^2/(2\sigma^2) \big)\), we have \(\hat{q}(\omega) = \sigma \sqrt{2\pi} \exp( – \sigma^2 \omega^2 / 2)\), and \(\displaystyle \Omega(f)^2 = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\sigma^{2k}}{2^k k!}\! \int_{\mathbb{R}} \!|f^{(k)}(x)|^2 dx\), and all derivatives are penalized (also, this extends in higher dimensions). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Finally, some versions of splines can be obtained from positive-definite kernels (and kernel ridge regression below exactly leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothing_spline">smoothing splines</a>).</p>



<h3>Kernel ridge regression</h3>



<p class="justify-text">As a consequence of the representer theorem above, when using the square loss, and for a vector of outputs / responses \(y \in \mathbb{R}^n\), when minimizing $$ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \big( y_i – \langle w, \Phi(x_i) \rangle_{\mathcal{F}} \big)^2 + \lambda \| w\|_\mathcal{F}^2,$$ the \(i\)-th prediction \( \langle w, \Phi(x_i) \rangle_{\mathcal{F}}\) is equal to \(\sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_j \langle \Phi(x_j),\Phi(x_i)\rangle_{\mathcal{F}}=(K\alpha)_i\) and \(\| w\|_\mathcal{F}^2\) is equal to \(\sum_{i,j=1}^n \alpha_i \alpha_j K_{ij} = \alpha^\top K \alpha\). This leads to the equivalent problem of minimizing $$ \frac{1}{n} \| y – K \alpha \|_2^2 + \lambda \alpha^\top K \alpha,$$ with a solution \(\alpha = ( K + n\lambda I)^{-1} y \in \mathbb{R}^n\), and prediction vector \(\hat{y} = K ( K+ n\lambda  I)^{-1} y \in \mathbb{R}^n\).</p>



<p>See an illustration below for the Gaussian kernel.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="444" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/krr-1-1024x415.png" class="wp-image-1127" height="180" />Kernel ridge regression estimation. Left: function \(f(x)\), with noisy observations. Right: kernel ridge regression estimate.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Running-time complexity</strong>. Implemented naively in a few lines of code, the complexity will be \(O(n^2)\) for computing the kernel matrix \(K\) and \(O(n^3)\) for solving the linear system to obtain \(\alpha\). This can be greatly reduced using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-rank_matrix_approximations">low-rank approximations</a> (a.k.a. Nyström’s method) or random features [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3182-random-features-for-large-scale-kernel-machines.pdf">5</a>]. More on these in future posts.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Do we really need positive-definiteness?</strong> In the objective function above, the only place where positive-definiteness seems needed is for the the regularization term \(\alpha^\top K \alpha\) to be convex, which automatically leads to a well-behaved optimization problem. We could do the same by replacing it by \(\| \alpha\|_2^2\) and no need for \(K\) to be positive-semidefinite. While this is implementable, it lacks a clear interpretation in terms of regularization of the prediction function and some of the techniques designed to avoid a running time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) cannot be used.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Choice of bandwidth</strong>. Compared to the Nadaraya-Watson estimator, for translation-invariant kernels, there are two parameters, the kernel bandwidth \(\sigma\) and the regularization parameter \(\lambda\). Below, we vary \(\lambda\) for two fixed values of \(\sigma\). A few points to note:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><em>Strong overfitting for small \(\lambda\)</em>: compared to Nadaraya-Watson, which was interpolating nicely for small \(\sigma\), kernel ridge regression overfits a lot for small \(\lambda\), with a wild behavior between observed inputs.</li><li><em>Robustness to larger \(\sigma\)</em>: with a proper regularization parameter \(\lambda\), larger values of \(\sigma\) can still lead to good predictions (as opposed to Nadaraya-Watson estimation). Another illustration of the robustness to larger \(\sigma\) is the possibility of having consistent estimation without a vanishing bandwidth \(\sigma\) (see below).</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="438" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/krr-1.gif" class="wp-image-1128" height="177" />Varying \(\lambda\) from small (leading to overfitting when \(\lambda\) is too small) to large (leading to underfitting when \(\lambda\) is too large). Two values of the bandwidth \(\sigma\).</figure></div>



<h3>Consistency and curse of dimensionality</h3>



<p class="justify-text">Positive-definite kernel methods are also non-parametric estimation procedures. They can adapt to any underlying function, if the kernel is <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_embedding_of_distributions#Universal_kernels">universal</a></em>.  For translation-invariant kernels, a sufficient condition is a <em>strictly positive</em> Fourier transform (which is typically true for all bandwidths).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In most analyses, the bandwidth \(\sigma\) is <em>fixed</em>, and the regularization parameter \(\lambda\) goes to zero with \(n\) (a notable exception is the nice paper from the Vert brothers [<a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume7/vert06a/vert06a.pdf">6</a>]). With the proper decay of \(\lambda\), as \(n\) grows, we obtain a consistent estimator.</p>



<p class="justify-text">When only assuming Lipschitz-continuity of the true underlying function, the rate of convergence also has a bad behavior in dimension \(d\), typically of the form \(O(n^{-1/d})\) (any way, such dependence is provably unavoidable, this is the usual curse of dimensionality for regression in high dimension).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Adaptivity to smooth functions</strong>. A key benefit of using positive-definite kernels is that if the underlying function is smoother than simply Lipschitz-continuous, then the convergence rates do improve with a proper choice of \(\lambda\). In the most favorable situation where the true regression function \(f\) belongs to the space of functions defined by the kernel, then the convergent rate is less than \(O(n^{-1/4})\). This may however require functions which are too smooth (in particular for the Gaussian kernel, these functions are infinitely differentiable). </p>



<p class="justify-text">However, kernel methods also lead to consistent estimation beyond this favorable situation, and such methods are adaptive to all functions which are in between Lipschitz-continuous functions (essentially bounded first order derivatives) and these potentially very smooth functions. For example, for the Gaussian kernel, as soon as it is \(s\)-times differentiable with bounded \(s\)-th order derivative, with \(s&gt;d/2\), then the convergence rate does not exhibit any more a dependence in \(d\) in the power of \(n\), i.e., the convergence rate is also less than \(O(n^{-1/4})\). If \(s\) is smaller than \(d/2\), then the convergence rate is in between \(O(n^{-1/4})\) and \(O(n^{-1/d})\), essentially of the form \(O(n^{-2s/d})\) or \(O(n^{-s/d})\) (for precise details, see [1, 2]).</p>



<p class="justify-text">This adaptivity requires the proper regularization parameter \(\lambda\). For the Gaussian kernel, as outlined in [<a href="http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v30/Bach13.pdf">9</a>], it may need to be very small (e.g., exponentially decaying with \(n\)), leading to optimization problems which are strongly ill-conditioned. More on this in a future post.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><em>Are all kernels cursed?</em> In this post, I have tried to highlight the difference between the two types of kernels, (1) the (pointwise) non-negative ones, which lead to local averaging techniques that cannot avoid the curse of dimensionality, even in favorable situations, and (2) the positive-definite ones, which exhibit some form of adaptivity.</p>



<p class="justify-text">If you went that far into the post, you are probably a kernel enthusiast, but if you are not and wondering why you should care about kernels in the neural network age, a few final thoughts: </p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>What are the adaptivity properties of neural networks</strong>? They are indeed superior; for example, with a single hidden layer, neural networks are adaptive to linear structures, such as dependence on a subset of variables, while kernels with similar architectures are not [<a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/14-546/14-546.pdf">10</a>]. However, neural networks do not lead (yet) to precise guarantees on the solvability of the corresponding optimization problems.</li><li><strong>Can we learn with positive-definite kernels with lots of data</strong>? Yes! With proper tools such as random features [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3182-random-features-for-large-scale-kernel-machines.pdf">5</a>] or column sampling, and with the proper and very nice pre-conditioning of [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6978-falkon-an-optimal-large-scale-kernel-method.pdf">11</a>], kernels can be used with ten millions of observations or more.</li><li><strong>Can we apply kernels to computer vision</strong>? Yes! See the nice <a href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2019/07/10/guest-post-by-julien-mairal-a-kernel-point-of-view-on-convolutional-neural-networks-part-i/">blog post</a> of Julien Mairal.</li><li><strong>Kernel methods as “theoretically tractable” high-dimensional models</strong>. In recent years, new ideas have emerged from training overparameterized neural networks, with (1) global convergence guarantees [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7567-on-the-global-convergence-of-gradient-descent-for-over-parameterized-models-using-optimal-transport.pdf">12</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06561">13</a>], some of them related to kernel methods [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8076-neural-tangent-kernel-convergence-and-generalization-in-neural-networks.pdf">14</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.07956">15</a>], and (2) a new phenomenon called “double descent” [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.11118">16</a>], which has a nice theoretical explanation / illustration with kernel methods. Again topics for future (shorter) posts.</li></ul>

<div>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%</div>
<div>Deal friends,</div>
<div></div>
<div>We are happy to announce the birth of a new conference on Information-Theoretic Cryptography (ITC). Information-theoretic cryptography studies security in the presence of computationally unbounded adversaries and covers a wide array of topics at the intersection of cryptography, coding theory, information-theory and theory of computation. Notable examples include randomness extraction and privacy amplification, secret sharing, secure multiparty computation and proof systems, private-information retrieval and locally decodable codes, authentication codes and non-malleable codes, differential privacy, quantum information processing, and information-theoretic foundations of physical-layer security. See <a href="https://itcrypto.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://itcrypto.github.io</a> for more information.</div>
<p>ITC replaces the International Conference on Information Theoretic Security (ICITS), which was dedicated to the same topic and ran 2005-2017. ITC can be seen as a reboot of ICITS with a new name, a new steering committee and a renewed excitement.  (beware: there is  a fake website for ICITS 2019 created by a known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Academy_of_Science,_Engineering_and_Technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fraudulent organization</a>)</p>
<div></div>
<div>The conference will have two tracks: a conference track and  a “greatest hits” track. The conference track will operate like a traditional conference with the usual review process and published proceedings. The “greatest hits” track consists of invited talks (not included in the proceedings) that highlight the most exciting recent advances in the area. We solicit nominations for “greatest hits” talks from the community.<p></p>
<p>The first ITC conference will take place in Boston, MA on June 17-19, 2020 (just before STOC).  The submission deadline for ITC 2020 is Dec 16, 2019 and the call for papers (including a nomination procedure for the greatest hits track) is available here:  <a href="https://itcrypto.github.io/2020.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://itcrypto.github.io/2020.html</a></p>
<p>Please submit your best work to ITC 2020! We hope to see many of you there!</p>
</div>
<div>best regards,</div>

<p style="text-align: left;" class="justify-text">Quantities of the form \(\displaystyle \log \Big( \sum_{i=1}^n \exp( x_i) \Big)\) for \(x \in \mathbb{R}^n\), often referred to as “log-sum-exp” functions are ubiquitous in machine learning, as they appear in normalizing constants of exponential families, and thus in many supervised learning formulations such as softmax regression, but also more generally in (Bayesian or frequentist) probabilistic modelling. Moreover, as often used in optimization, they are a standard way of performing a soft maximum. In this context, the function defined as  $$  \displaystyle f_\varepsilon(x) = \varepsilon \log \Big( \sum_{i=1}^n \exp( x_i / \varepsilon) \Big),$$ is such that \( \displaystyle \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0^+} f_\varepsilon(x) = \max\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Is it possible to go from the maximum back to the softmax \(f_\varepsilon(x)\) (for any strictly positive \(\varepsilon\), and thus equivalently for \(\varepsilon=1\)) ? Beyond being a nice mathematical puzzle, this would be useful for very large \(n\) when the maximization problem could be easier than the summation problem (more on this below).</p>



<p class="justify-text">While this seems at first impossible, the Gumbel trick provides a surprising randomized solution. We consider adding some independent and identically distributed random variables \(\gamma_1,\dots,\gamma_n\), to form the vector \(x + \gamma \in \mathbb{R}^n\) and takes its maximum component, that is, $$<br /> y = x + \gamma \mbox{ and } z = \max \big\{ y_1,\dots, y_n \big\} = \max \big\{ x_1 + \gamma_1,\dots,x_n +\gamma_n \big\}.$$ With a well chosen distribution for the components of \(\gamma\), we exactly have $$\mathbb{E} z = <br /> \mathbb{E} \max \big\{ y_1,\dots, y_n \big\} =  \mathbb{E} \max \big\{ x_1 + \gamma_1,\dots,x_n +\gamma_n \big\} = \log \Big( \sum_{i=1}^n \exp( x_i) \Big).$$ This is achieved by the Gumbel distribution, hence the name “Gumbel trick” (the first applications within machine learning seem to be from <a href="https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~manfred/pubs/open/P3.pdf">[1]</a> and <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~gpapan/pubs/confr/PapandreouYuille_PerturbAndMap_ieee-c-iccv11.pdf">[2]</a>, while this is a well-known fact in social sciences, see, e.g., <a href="https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt7z91732x/qt7z91732x.pdf">[3]</a>). We first make a detour through exponential distributions. </p>



<h2>Minimum of independent exponential distributions</h2>



<p class="justify-text"> A random variable \(T\) is distributed according to the exponential distribution with parameter \(\lambda \in \mathbb{R}\), if  it is supported on the positive real line and its density there is equal to \(t \mapsto \lambda \exp( – \lambda t).\)  We have these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution">classical properties</a>: </p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>\(\mathbb{E} T = 1/\lambda\) and \({\rm var}(T) = 1/ \lambda^2\).</li><li>\(T\) has the same distribution as \(-( 1/\lambda)\log U\), where \(U\) has a uniform distribution on \([0,1]\), leading to a simple algorithm to sample \(T\).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">A key property which is used heavily in point processes and queuing theory is characterizing the minimum and minimizer of independent exponentially distributed random variables.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Proposition</strong>. Given \(n\) independent variables \(T_i\)  distributed according to exponential distributions with parameter \(\lambda_i\), \(i=1,\dots,n\), the minimum \(V = \min \{T_1,\dots,T_n\}\) is distributed according to an exponential distribution with parameter \(\lambda_1+\dots+\lambda_n\), and the minimizer \(i^\ast= \arg \min_{i \in \{1,\dots,n\}} T_i\) (breaking ties arbitrarily) is distributed according to a multinomial distribution of parameter \(\pi\) with \(\displaystyle \pi_i = \frac{\lambda_i}{ \lambda_1 + \cdots + \lambda_n}\), for \(i \in \{1,\dots,n\}\). Moreover, \(i^\ast\) and \(V\) are independent.</p>



<p class="justify-text"> <em>(simple) Proof</em>. A direct integration shows that $$ \mathbb{P}( T \geq u) = \int_{u}^{+\infty} \lambda \exp( -\lambda t) = \exp(-\lambda u).$$ We can then directly compute the probability, for a fixed \(i \in {1,\dots,n}\) and \(u \in \mathbb{R}_+\): $$<br /> \mathbb{P}( I^\ast = i, V \geq u)  =  \mathbb{P}( T_i \geq u, \forall j \neq i, T_j \geq T_i),$$ which is equal by independence of all \(T_j\)’s to $$  \int_{u}^{+\infty} \Big( \prod_{ j\neq i} \exp( –  \lambda_j t_i) \Big) \lambda_i \exp( – \lambda_i  t_i) dt_i =  \exp\Big( – u \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i \Big) \times \frac{\lambda_i}{ \lambda_1 + \cdots + \lambda_n},$$ which exactly shows the desired result (both independence and the claimed distributions).</p>



<h2>From exponential to Gumbel distributions </h2>



<p class="justify-text">A real random variable \(\Gamma\) is distributed according to a Gumbel distribution with parameter \(x \in \mathbb{R}\), if it is equal in distribution to \(\Gamma = -\log T – C\), where \(T\) is distributed according to an exponential distribution of parameter \(\lambda = \exp(x)\), and \(C\approx 0.5772\) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Mascheroni_constant">Euler constant</a> (note that in some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumbel_distribution">conventions</a>, \(C\) is not subtracted). We have the following properties:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>\(\mathbb{E} \Gamma = x\) where Indeed, we have: $$ \mathbb{E} \Gamma= -\int_0^{+\infty} \log (y\exp(-x)) \exp(-y) dy\  – C= x \ – \int_0^{+\infty} (\log y)\exp(-y) dy \ – C = x,$$ with a standard property of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Mascheroni_constant">Euler constant</a>.</li><li>\({\rm var}(\Gamma) = \frac{\pi^2}{6}\) (proof left as an exercise, derivatives of the Gamma function could be handy).</li><li>\(\Gamma\) has the same distribution as \(x – C – \log( – \log U) \), where \(U\) has a uniform distribution on \([0,1]\), leading to a simple algorithm to sample \(\Gamma\).</li><li>The density of \(\Gamma\) is \(p(\gamma) = \exp( x-\gamma -C  –  \exp( x – \gamma – C) )\), as shown below for \(x=0\).</li></ul>

<p class="justify-text">The proposition above on exponential distributions leads to the following result.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Proposition</strong>. Given \(n\) independent variables \(\Gamma_i\) distributed according to Gumbel distributions with parameter \(x_i\), \(i=1,\dots,n\), the maximum \(Z = \max \{\Gamma_1,\dots,\Gamma_n\}\) is distributed according to a Gumbel distribution with parameter (and thus mean) \(\log \big( \sum_{k=1}^n \exp(x_k) \big)\), the minimizer \(i^\ast= \arg \max_{i \in {1,\dots,n}} \Gamma_i\) (breaking ties arbitrarily) is distributed according to a multinomial distribution of parameter \(\pi\) with \(\displaystyle \pi_i = \frac{\exp(x_i)}{ \exp(x_1) + \cdots + \exp(x_n)}\), for \(i \in {1,\dots,n}\). Moreover, \(i^\ast\) and \(Z\) are independent.</p>



<h2>Applications in machine learning </h2>



<p>The Gumbel trick can be used in mainly two ways: (a) the main goal is to approximate the expectation using a finite average or using stochastic gradients (then only the value of the maximum is used), (b) the minimizer is used for sampling purposes. I will focus only on the first type of applications and refer to the very nice posts of <a href="http://timvieira.github.io/blog/post/2014/08/01/gumbel-max-trick-and-weighted-reservoir-sampling/">Tim Vieira</a>, <a href="https://cmaddis.github.io/gumbel-machinery">Chris Maddison</a>, and <a href="https://laurent-dinh.github.io/2016/11/22/gumbel-max.html">Laurent Dinh</a> for the sampling aspects.</p>



<h3>Log-partition functions</h3>



<p class="justify-text">We consider \(d\) finite sets \(\mathcal{X}_1,\dots,\mathcal{X}_d\), and a probability mass function at \(x = (x_1,\dots,x_d)\) of the form: $$p(x) = p(x_1,\dots,x_d) = \exp( f(x)\  – A(f)),$$ where \(f:  \mathcal{X}_1 \times \dots \times \mathcal{X}_d \to \mathbb{R}\) is a any function, and $$  A(f) = \log \big( \sum_{x_1 \in \mathcal{X}_1,\dots,x_d \in \mathcal{X}_d} \exp( f(x) ) \big)$$ is the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_function_(mathematics)">log-partition function</a> (which is here to make the probability mass sum to one). The cardinality of \(\mathcal{X}_1 \times \dots \times \mathcal{X}_d\) is exponential in \(d\) and thus the sum defining \(A(f)\) cannot in general be computed even for moderate \(d\). Since computing \(A(f)\) or its derivatives is a key step in many inference tasks, finding approximations is one of the standard computational problems in probabilistic modelling.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The Gumbel trick allows to go from maximization problems to “log-sum-exp” problems, and is only useful when the maximization problem is easy to solve while the “log-sum-exp” problem is not. Can this really happen? In other words…</p>



<h3>Is the Gumbel trick useful?</h3>



<p class="justify-text">There are many conditions under which combinatorial optimization problems can be solved in polynomial time, but two properties have emerged as crucial (at least in machine learning applications): (1) dynamic programming, and (2) linear programming. For simplicity, I will illustrate them for binary problems where \(\mathcal{X}_i = \{0,1\}\) for all \(i\), and so-called “cut functions” \(f(x) = \sum_{i,j = 1}^d w_{i,j} x_i x_j + \sum_{i=1}^d w_i x_i\), for arbitrary scalar weights \(w_{i,j}\), \(w_i\).</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Dynamic programming</strong>: this corresponds to the situations where most of the weights \(w_{i,j}\) are equal to zero, with the graph on the vertex set \(\{1,\dots,n\}\) with edge set equal to the pairs \((i,j)\) with \(w_{i,j}\neq 0\), being a tree, or a chain. <br />For example, consider \(f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{d-1} w_{i,i+1} x_i x_{i+1} + \sum_{i=1}^d w_i x_i\). In this situation, one can compute sequentially the functions (with increasing index \(k\)) $$  f_k(x_k) = \max_{x_1,\dots,x_{k-1}} \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} w_{i,i+1} x_i x_{i+1} + \sum_{i=1}^k w_i x_i,$$ noticing that $$f_{k+1}(x_{k+1}) = \max_{x_{k} \in \{0,1\}} f_k(x_k) + w_{k-1,k} x_k x_{k+1} + w_{k+1} x_{k+1}, $$ which can be computed easily; the recursion leads to the desired value \(\max_{x_{d} \in \{0,1\}} f_d(x_d)\). <br />In order to obtain the identity above, we have simply used the property $$\max\{ A + B, C + B\} = B + \max \{A,C\}.$$ However, this property is also true for the softmax, as $$\log \big( \exp(A + B) + \exp(C + B) \big) = B+ \log \big( \exp(A) + \exp(C ) \big).$$ Thus, the same dynamic programming strategy works for softmax, and using the Gumbel trick is here useless. (here, we have described a particular instance of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief_propagation">sum-product and max-product</a> algorithms for graphical models). </li></ul>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Linear programming</strong>: for the particular generic quadratic binary problem, we can write for any \(x_i,x_j \in \{0,1\}\), \(x_i x_j = \min \{x_i,x_j\}\), and, if all \(w_{i,j}\) are non-positive (and here no constraint regarding having many zero values), then the function \(g: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\) defined as  \(g(x) = \sum_{i,j = 1}^d w_{i,j} \min \{x_i,x_j\} + \sum_{i=1}^d w_i x_i\)  is concave and equal to \(f\) for \(x \in \{0,1\}^d\). The convex relaxation of computing \(\max_{x \in \{0,1\}^d} f(x)\) is \(\max_{x \in [0,1]^d} f(x)\), which is a <em>concave maximization</em> problem, which can be solved in polynomial time (it can be cast as a linear programming problem). For this particular problems, due to a property called <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submodular_set_function">submodularity</a></em>, the convex relaxation happens to be tight. In these situations, maximizing is feasible while “log-sum-exp” is not. However, the Gumbel trick requires to perturb \(f(x)\) with a different random values for <strong>all</strong> \(2^d\) assignments of \((x_1,\dots,x_d)\), thus totally losing the structure above. Therefore, using the Gumbel trick is here also useless.</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">Thus it seems that for classical situations where maximization can be done in polynomial time, the Gumbel trick is useless, either because performing log-sum-exp is as simple (for dynamic programming), or because maximization is intractable once the Gumbel perturbations are added (for linear programming). Can we make it useful?</p>



<h3>Separable Gumbel perturbations</h3>



<p class="justify-text">This is where Tamir Hazan and Tommi Jaakkola <a href="https://icml.cc/2012/papers/528.pdf">[4]</a> come in with the following very nice and important result, which is true beyond cut functions, and shows that with a separable random perturbation, we get an upper-bound of the log-partition function.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Proposition</strong>. Given \(d\) random functions \(\gamma_i : \mathcal{X}_i \mapsto \mathbb{R}\), \(i=1,\dots,d\), such that each value (within and across the functions) is sampled independently distributed from a Gumbel distribution with zero mean, then $$A(f) \leq \mathbb{E} \Big[ \max_{x_1 \in \mathcal{X}_1,\dots,x_d \in \mathcal{X}_d} f(x) + \sum_{i=1}^d \gamma_i(x_i)\Big].$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><em>Proof</em>. We can show the result by induction on \(d\), by first conditioning on \(\gamma_d\) to get $$\mathbb{E} \Big[ \! \max_{x_1,\dots,x_d} \!f(x_1,\dots,x_d) + \! \sum_{i=1}^d \gamma_i(x_i)\Big] = \mathbb{E} \bigg[\mathbb{E}  \Big[ \! \max_{x_1,\dots,x_d} \!f(x_1,\dots,x_d) + \! \sum_{i=1}^d \gamma_i(x_i) \  \Big| \ \gamma_d \Big] \bigg], $$ and the property that the expectation of the max is larger than the max of the expectation to get the lower-bound $$   \mathbb{E} \bigg[ \max_{x_d} \mathbb{E}  \Big[ \! \max_{x_1,\dots,x_{d-1}} \!f(x_1,\dots,x_d) + \! \sum_{i=1}^d \gamma_i(x_i) \  \Big| \ \gamma_d \Big] \bigg].$$ It is equal to $$   \mathbb{E} \bigg[ \max_{x_d} \Big\{  \gamma_{d}(x_d) + \mathbb{E}  \Big[ \! \max_{x_1,\dots,x_{d-1}} \!f(x_1,\dots,x_d) + \! \sum_{i=1}^{d-1} \gamma_i(x_i) \  \Big| \ \gamma_d \Big] \Big\} \bigg], $$ which is lower-bounded by applying the result for \(d-1\), by $$  \mathbb{E} \max_{x_d} \Big\{ \gamma_d(x_d) + \log \Big( \sum_{x_1 ,\dots,x_{d-1}} \exp(f(x))\Big) \Big\} =  \log \Big( \sum_{x_1 ,\dots,x_{d}} \exp(f(x))\Big),$$ by applying the regular Gumbel trick to \(\gamma_d\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">For binary problems like for cut-functions, this corresponds to adding to \(f(x) = \sum_{i,j = 1}^d w_{i,j} x_i x_j + \sum_{i=1}^d w_i x_i\), the term \(\sum_{i=1}^d x_i \gamma_i(1) + \sum_{i=1}^d (1-x_i) \gamma_i(0)\), which is a linear function of \(x\), and still leading to a tight convex relaxation. Here \(2d\) Gumbel variables are used instead of \(2^d\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">This seminal result led to a series of works using this result to approximate the log-partition function for parameter learning in intractable distributions where the maximization problem is efficient [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v33/gane14.pdf">5</a>, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6402-parameter-learning-for-log-supermodular-distributions.pdf">6</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Interestingly, the Gumbel trick is a simple consequence of a special property of a specific exponential family (here the exponential distribution). Some other exponential families (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution">Gamma</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution">Dirichlet</a>) lead to different special properties with other nice consequences, but this is for future posts.</p>

<p class="justify-text">In my <a href="https://francisbach.com/the-%CE%B7-trick-or-the-effectiveness-of-reweighted-least-squares/">previous post</a>, I described various (potentially non-smooth) functions that have quadratic (and thus smooth) variational formulations, a possibility that I referred to as the η-trick. For example, in its simplest formulation, we have \( \displaystyle |w| = \min_{ \eta \geq 0} \frac{1}{2} \frac{w^2}{\eta} + \frac{1}{2} \eta\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">While it seems most often used for deriving simple optimization algorithms, it has other applications and interpretations in machine learning, in particular for “multiple kernel learning” (MKL), super-Gaussian distributions and convex relaxations of combinatorial penalties. In this post, I will cover the MKL part, which leads to a framework for learning discriminative representations from data.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We first take a detour through supervised learning with <em>linear models</em> based on <em>features</em>.</p>



<h2>Learning “features” for “linear” predictions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Consider the typical supervised learning problem of estimating labels \(y_i \in \mathbb{R}\) from some inputs \(x_i\) in a input space \(\mathcal{X}\), for \(i = 1,\dots,n\). The input space \(\mathcal{X}\) is left generic on purpose, and, both in theory and practice, inputs can have a wide variety of structures (e.g., images, sequences, graphs, web pages, text documents, logs, etc.).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to deal with such potentially non-vectorial inputs, a <em>feature map</em> \(\varphi: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}^d\) is often used, and then <em>linear models</em> consider prediction functions of the form \(f(x) = w^\top \varphi(x)\), where \(w \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is a weight vector. The terminology “linear” refers to linearity in the parameters \(w\), and <strong><em>not</em></strong> linearity in the inputs \(x\); indeed, \(\varphi\) may be non-linear, and the notion can even have no meaning if \(\mathcal{X}\) is not a vector space (note that when \(\mathcal{X} = \mathbb{R}^d\), and \(\varphi(x) = x\), which is common in many applications, we have <em>in this particular situation</em> predictions that are linear in the inputs). Given the feature map \(\varphi\), the first task is to learn the parameter vector \(w \in \mathbb{R}^d\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Using the square loss for simplicity (but everything extends to convex loss functions such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_functions_for_classification">logistic loss</a>), training is usually done by minimizing with respect to \(w\) the so-called regularized empirical risk $$ \frac{1}{2n} \sum_{i=1}^n \big(y_i – w^\top \varphi(x_i) \big)^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \| w\|_2^2,$$ where the \(\ell_2\)-norm-regularization is standard to avoid overfitting and makes the problem numerically well-behaved. While for general convex loss functions, we would get a convex optimization problem, here, with the square loss, it is even simpler as we can get a solution in closed form (see below).</p>



<p class="justify-text">While explicit fixed feature maps \(\varphi : \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}^d\) have always been successfully used, learning these feature maps directly from data is an important task in machine learning. Given some parameterization \(\varphi_\eta(x)\) (with parameters \(\eta\)), one then minimizes the objective function $$ \frac{1}{2n} \sum_{i=1}^n \big(y_i – w^\top \varphi_\eta(x_i) \big)^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \| w \|_2^2,$$  both with respect to the weight vector \(w\) <em>and</em> the feature parameters \(\eta\) (the only change from the equation above is the replacement of \(\varphi(x_i)\) by \(\varphi_\eta(x_i)\)). Regardless of the particular parametrization of \(\varphi_\eta\), the optimization problem is convex in \(w\), but typically is not convex in \(\eta\) (and even more rarely jointly convex).</p>



<p class="justify-text">This framework includes (but is not limited to) neural networks, where \(w\) is the set of output weights and \(\eta\) corresponds to all other neuron weights, and \(\varphi_\eta(x)\) is the value of the last hidden layer; see an example below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="423" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/neuralnet-1.png" class="wp-image-657" height="186" />Neural networks with two hidden layers. The input weights \(\eta\) (in green) define a function \(x \mapsto \varphi_\eta(x)\), which is the last hidden layer (in blue), which can be linearly combined with output weights \(w\) (in red), leading to the output \(y\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">The most direct approach is to estimate \((\eta,w)\) through joint gradient descent techniques. For neural networks, the problem is not jointly convex in \((\eta,w)\), but remains convex in \(w\); thus, even if \(\eta\) is not optimally estimated, the optimization in \(w\) by gradient descent, which is robust (since the objective function is convex), can still lead to a good prediction function \(x \mapsto w^\top \varphi_\eta(x)\) (in particular when  the size of the feature vector \(d\) is large). In other words (and in a quite intuitive/hand-wavy way), being very precise in the feature vector \(\varphi_\eta\) (which we cannot guarantee) is not as important as being precise in optimizing \(w\) (which we can). A key empirical property of (deep) neural networks is that, with the proper initialization and stochastic gradient descent algorithms, the feature parameters \(\eta\) can be learned with sufficient precision and great adaptivity to the final task (of predicting the labels). The theory about this now well-known empirical behavior is starting to emerge (a topic for another post).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Another approach to learn parameters, which comes with theoretical guarantees because it relies on a jointly convex problem when using appropriate parameterizations, is to first minimize with respect to \(w\) (again, which is easy because of convexity), and optimize the resulting function with respect to the feature map \(\varphi_\eta\). It turns out that there is a nice connection with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method">kernel methods</a>, as I now show.</p>



<h2>Optimizing the weight vector \(w\) and the kernel trick</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider a generic feature map \(\varphi_\eta: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}^d\), and we denote by \(\Phi \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}\) the concatenation of all \(n\) feature vectors \(\varphi_\eta(x_i)\), \(i=1,\dots,n\) (since we consider \(\eta\) fixed in this section, we drop the dependence in \(\eta\)). the objective writes in compact form $$ \frac{1}{2n} \| y – \Phi  w \|_2^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \| w\|_2^2.$$ Its gradient is equal to \(\frac{1}{n} \Phi ^\top ( \Phi  w – y ) + \lambda w\), and setting it to zero leads to the minimizer \(w = ( \Phi ^\top \Phi  + n \lambda I)^{-1} \Phi^\top y \in \mathbb{R}^d\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We can then use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodbury_matrix_identity">matrix inversion lemma</a>, to obtain \(w = \Phi^\top  ( \Phi  \Phi ^\top + n \lambda I)^{-1} y\). By doing so we went from the <em>empirical (non-centered) covariance matrix</em> \(\frac{1}{n} \Phi ^\top \Phi  \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}\) of the features, to the <em>kernel matrix</em> \(K = \Phi \Phi^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\). The notation \(\alpha = ( \Phi \Phi^\top + n \lambda I)^{-1} y = ( K + n \lambda I)^{-1} y \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is often used, so that \(w = \Phi^\top \alpha = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i \varphi_\eta(x_i)\), that is, \(w\) is a linear combination of the input features and the weights in this combination can be computed by only accessing the input features through the kernel matrix, which is composed of dot-products \(\varphi_\eta(x_i)^\top \varphi_\eta(x_j)\). This is exactly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method">kernel trick</a> and (an explicit version of) the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representer_theorem">representer theorem</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The kernel trick allows to work with large feature spaces, i.e., feature maps \(\varphi\) with potentially high (and sometimes infinite) output dimension \(d\), with a computational cost which is independent of \(d\), if the kernel \(k(x,x’) = \varphi_\eta(x)^\top \varphi_\eta(x’)\) can be evaluated cheaply. Such kernels have been designed in the last twenty years for most of the common data types that I mentioned above (e.g., images, sequences, graphs, web pages, text documents, logs, etc.). See, e.g., the two reference books <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/kernel-methods-for-pattern-analysis/811462F4D6CD6A536A05127319A8935A">[1]</a> and <a href="http://agbs.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/lwk/">[2]</a>, as well as the nice <a href="http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~jvert/teaching/">teaching slides</a> of Jean-Philippe Vert. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that kernel methods unfortunately come naturally with a running time with a quadratic  dependence in \(n\) (as this is the cost of computing the kernel matrix), unless specific techniques are used (<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5936-less-is-more-nystrom-computational-regularization.pdf">Nyström / column sampling</a> or <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3182-random-features-for-large-scale-kernel-machines">random features</a>) to have a running-time which is subquadratic in \(n\) (these will be topics for future posts).</p>



<h2>Convexity of the optimized objective</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Now that we can compute the minimizer of the optimization problem above in closed form \(w = ( \Phi^\top  \Phi+ n \lambda I)^{-1} \Phi^\top  y\), we can evaluate the optimal value of the objective   $$ \frac{1}{2n} \| y – \Phi w \|_2^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \| w\|_2^2 = \frac{1}{2n} y^\top y \ – \frac{1}{n} y^\top \Phi w + \frac{1}{2n} w^\top ( \Phi^\top \Phi + n \lambda I) w . $$ This leads to after replacing \(w\) by its value, $$ \frac{1}{2n} y^\top y \ – \frac{1}{2n} y^\top  \Phi ( \Phi^\top  \Phi+ n \lambda I)^{-1} \Phi^\top y = \frac{1}{2n} y^\top \big( I – \Phi ( \Phi^\top  \Phi+ n \lambda I)^{-1} \Phi^\top\big) y.$$ Using the matrix inversion lemma again, the optimized objective is equal to $$\frac{1}{2n} y^\top \big( I –  ( \Phi \Phi^\top  + n \lambda I)^{-1} \Phi \Phi^\top\big) y = \frac{1}{2n} y^\top \big( I – ( K + n \lambda I)^{-1} K \big) y =  \frac{\lambda}{2} y^\top ( K + n \lambda I)^{-1} y. $$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The features only enter this optimal value as a function \(R(K)\) of the kernel matrix \(K = \Phi \Phi^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\). This function happens to be convex, which can be seen here from the explicit expression of \(R(K)\) and a bit of knowledge in convex analysis (see the classical <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/">Boyd and Vandenberghe book</a>, example 3.4). This is true beyond the square loss and this can nicely be obtained by Lagrange duality (see <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume5/lanckriet04a/lanckriet04a.pdf">[3]</a>).</p>



<p class="justify-text">As I now present, this convexity is the source of approaches to learn the kernel matrix (and hence implicitly the feature vectors) directly from data. </p>



<h2>Multiple kernel learning (MKL)</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Given that the set of kernel matrices is a convex cone, a natural parameterization is through a conic combination \(K(\eta) = \sum_{j=1}^m \eta_j K^j\) of base kernel matrices \(K^1,\dots,K^m\), with \(\eta \in \mathbb{R}^m\) being a vector of positive weights. The typical application scenario is as follows: for a given type of data (e.g., images or biological sequences), several kernel functions \(k^1,\dots,k^m : \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}\) exist in the literature, based on different principles and types of information. Combining them allows to benefit from the predictive power of all of them. This framework is referred to as <em>multiple kernel learning</em>. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Typically, a regularization constraint on the trace of the kernel matrix  \(K(\eta)\) is used as the trace of the kernel matrix is known to  be a good quantity to control generalization to unseen data (see <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume5/lanckriet04a/lanckriet04a.pdf">[3]</a>); this leads to a (positive) linear constraint on the vector \(\eta\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out that there is a nice relationship with sparsity-inducing norms, which is obtained through the η-trick. We first reinterpret the problem as follows: we consider the feature maps \(\varphi^j: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}^{d_j}\) associated with each kernel \(k^j\), \(j=1,\dots,m\), so that \(K^j_{a,b} = \varphi^j(x_a)^\top \varphi^j(x_b)\) for all \(a,b \in {1,\dots,n}\). We can then consider the weighted concatenated feature map $$\varphi_\eta(x) = ( \eta_1^{1/2} \varphi^1(x), \dots, \eta_m^{1/2} \varphi^m(x)) \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1+\dots+d_m},$$ for which the kernel \(\varphi_\eta(x)^\top \varphi_\eta(x’) \) is equal to \(\sum_{j=1}^m \eta_j k^j(x,x’)\). See a representation below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="495" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mkl-1.png" class="wp-image-720" height="327" />Multiple kernel learning with three blocks of features (in green), multiplied by the kernel parameters \(\eta_1,\eta_2,\eta_3\) to obtain the weighted concatenated feature vector \(\varphi_\eta(x)\) (in blue), composed of three blocks.  Note that all blocks are typically multi-dimensional. These last blue blocks are linearly combined with weights \(w\) (in red), leading to the output \(y\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">This provides a link between weighted sums of kernel matrices and specifically parameterized feature maps: we can indeed see the problem either as estimating a specific feature vector \(\varphi_\eta\), or as estimating a conic combination of matrices.  The key benefit of this formulation is that it is <em>jointly convex</em> in \((w,\eta)\), and thus provably “easy” to optimize.</p>



<p class="justify-text"> The η-trick provides an interesting link with sparsity-inducing norms.</p>



<h2>Equivalence with group Lasso</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider as above \(m\) block of features and we denote by \(\Phi^j \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_j}\) the design matrix for the block \(j \in \{1,\dots,m\}\). The (squared) group Lasso problem aims at estimating a linear combination of each block of variables with a regularization term that selects whole blocks (instead of individual variables regardless of the block structures if an \(\ell_1\)-norm was used): $$ \min_{ v_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1}, \dots, \ v_m \in \mathbb{R}^{d_m}} \frac{1}{2n} \| y – \Phi^1 v_1 – \cdots – \Phi^m v_m \|_2^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \Big( \| v_1\|_2 + \cdots + \| v_m\|_2 \Big)^2.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">We can apply the <a href="https://francisbach.com/the-%CE%B7-trick-or-the-effectiveness-of-reweighted-least-squares/">η-trick</a> to obtain the equivalent problem: $$ \min_{ v_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1}, \dots, \ v_m \in \mathbb{R}^{d_m}} \min_{ \eta \in \Delta_m}  \frac{1}{2n} \| y – \Phi^1 v_1 – \cdots – \Phi^m v_m \|_2^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \Big( \frac{\| v_1\|_2^2}{\eta_1} + \cdots + \frac{ \| v_m\|_2^2}{\eta_m} \Big),$$ where \(\Delta_m\) is the simplex in \(\mathbb{R}^m\). Using the change of variable \(w_j = \eta_j^{-1/2} v_j\), we exactly get the minimization of $$ \frac{1}{2n} \| y – \Phi_\eta {w} \|^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \| {w} \|_2^2,$$ where \(\Phi_\eta \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times (d_1+\cdots+d_m)}\) is the design matrix associated with the concatenated weighted features \(\varphi_\eta(x_i)\), \(i=1,\dots,n\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Applying our results above, we can minimize with respect to \({w}\) in closed form as \({w} =  (  \Phi_\eta^\top \Phi_\eta + n \lambda I)^{-1} \Phi_\eta^\top  y\), and the resulting minimization problem in \(\eta\) becomes $$ \min_{\eta \in \Delta_m} \frac{\lambda}{2} y^\top \big( K(\eta) + n \lambda I \big)^{-1} y,$$ where \(K(\eta) = \sum_{j=1}^m \eta_j \Phi^j (\Phi^j)^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) is a kernel matrix which is a convex combination of the \(m\) kernel matrices \(K^j = \Phi^j (\Phi^j)^\top\) corresponding to each block of input variables. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Thus, the group Lasso is equivalent to optimizing over kernel matrices of the form \(K(\eta)\) the convex function \(R: K \mapsto  \frac{\lambda}{2} y^\top ( K + n \lambda I  )^{-1} y\), which happens to be exactly the minimal value of the kernel ridge regression problem, that is, the regularized training error after training that we have presented above (note here that in order to have the constraint that \(\eta\) is on the simplex, that is, \(\eta_1+\cdots + \eta_m = 1\), we can simply impose that all kernel matrices, including \(K(\eta)\), have the same trace, which is standard in practice).</p>



<p class="justify-text">NB: This equivalence between group Lasso and MKL was first proved by Gert Lanckriet, Michael Jordan and myself <a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2004/proceedings/papers/321.pdf">[4]</a>, using convex duality and a less intuitive argument, while Alain Rakotomamonjy, Stéphane Canu, Yves Grandvalet and myself <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/rakotomamonjy08a/rakotomamonjy08a.pdf">[5]</a> used the η-trick as described above (if you know about earlier references, please let me know).</p>



<h2>Consequences and extensions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The equivalence between MKL and group Lasso has several interesting consequences.</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Learning weights or using uniform weights:</strong> through the η-trick, we can thus see that minimizing the regularized training error with respect to the kernel matrix is in fact the solution of a sparsity-inducing formulation. Thus it should only be used when such behavior is expected, i.e., learning from a large set of kernel matrices \(K^j\), and selecting only a few of them (for theoretical guarantees, see <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/bach08b/bach08b.pdf">[6]</a>). If all kernel matrices are well-selected by the practitioner, a uniform sum typically suffices. In particular, note that for our feature weighting parametrization, the space of functions \(x \mapsto w^\top \varphi_\eta(x)\) when \(w\) varies is always the same as soon as all components of \(\eta\) are strictly positive, and thus using learned or uniform weights should correspond to a prior knowledge that one has about the particular set of kernel matrices.</li><li><strong>Algorithms for MKL / group Lasso</strong>: Since the optimization problem is jointly convex in \((w,\eta)\), the global optimum can be found with arbitrary precision, with a variety of algorithms, working with kernels or not; see <a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/bach_jenatton_mairal_obozinski_FOT.pdf">[7, section 1.5]</a>.</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">This equivalence has several interesting extensions beyond plain sparsity or group sparsity.</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Beyond conic combinations</strong>: Other parameterizations of kernel matrices can be used, some of them related to the extension of the η-trick which I mention in my <a href="https://francisbach.com/the-%CE%B7-trick-or-the-effectiveness-of-reweighted-least-squares/">previous post</a>. For example, when using \(K(\Lambda) = \Phi \Lambda \Phi^\top\) where \(\Lambda\) is a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix, we obtain an equivalence with trace norm regularization [8].</li><li><strong>Different constraints on </strong>η<strong>‘s</strong>: The trace penalty leads to a linear constraint on top of positivity. Other constraints can be used, such as \(\ell_p\)-norms for \(p \geq 1\) <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume12/kloft11a/kloft11a.pdf">[9]</a>, or constraints that induce specific behaviors on the selection of blocks of variables <a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/bach_jenatton_mairal_obozinski_FOT.pdf">[7, section 3.4]</a>, e.g., block \(\Phi^1\) always has to be selected before block \(\Phi^2\).</li></ul>



<h2>Learning features or kernels?</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In conclusion, we have seen two main ways of estimating data representations directly from data, which seem different: learning an explicit feature representation (often called an “embedding”) \(\varphi_\eta(x)\) or the corresponding kernel \(\varphi_\eta(x)^\top \varphi_\eta(x’)\), where features are only implicit. When using these representations through linear models (which is the standard way), using one or the other makes no difference in predictive performance, but usually it does on <em>algorithms</em> required to learn on these features, which may need one representation or the others.</p>



<p class="justify-text">For stochastic gradient based algorithms, using explicit \(d\)-dimensional representations leads to algorithms whose running-time complexity is proportional to \(nd\), which, when \(d\) is small, can be advantageous over the complexity in \(O(n^2)\) associated with just computing the \(n \times n\) kernel matrix. Therefore, explicit features numerically seem beneficial at first, but, specific techniques can be used (<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5936-less-is-more-nystrom-computational-regularization.pdf">Nyström / column sampling</a> or <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3182-random-features-for-large-scale-kernel-machines">random features</a>) to obtain a similar running time (again, to be explained in a future post). Thus, once appropriately done, going for features or kernels does not make a huge difference.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The parametrization of the feature vector \(\varphi_\eta(x)\) or the associated kernel makes however a key difference. To obtain a jointly convex representation in \((w,\eta)\), we need a representation in terms of kernels which is linear in \(\eta\), which is a significant modelling limitation: only feature reweighting is possible, which is already useful in presence of many such features. However, when non-linear feature building is required, more complex parametrizations are needed. Empirically, although leading to jointly non-convex problems, they have been used efficiently and successfully in a wide variety of neural networks. Providing theoretical guarantees and guidelines on how to achieve such non-linear feature learning is an active area of research.</p>

<p><em>by Nataly Brukhim, Naman Agarwal and Elad Hazan, based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08720">this paper</a> </em></p>
<p>In a famous 1906 competition at a local fair in Plymouth, England, participants were asked to guess the weight of an ox. Out of a crowd of hundreds, no one came close to the ox’s actual weight, but the average of all guesses was almost correct. How is it that combining the opinions of laymen can somehow arrive at highly reasoned decisions, despite the weak judgment of individual members? This concept of harnessing wisdom from weak rules of thumb to form a highly accurate prediction rule, is the basis of ensemble methods and <b>boosting</b>. Boosting is a theoretically sound methodology that has transformed machine learning across a variety of applications; in classification and regression tasks, online learning, and many more.</p>
<p>In the case of online learning, examples for training a predictor are not available in advance, but are revealed one at a time. Online boosting combines a set of online prediction rules, or <i>weak learners. </i>At every time step, each weak learner outputs a prediction, suffers some loss and is then updated accordingly. The performance of an online learner is measured using the <i>regret</i> criterion, which compares the accumulated loss over time with that of the best fixed decision in hindsight. A <i>Boosting</i> algorithm can choose which examples are fed to each of the weak learners, as well as the losses they incur. Intuitively, the online booster can encourage some weak learners to become really good in predicting certain common cases, while allowing others to focus on edge cases that are harder to predict. Overall, the <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/beygelzimer15.pdf">online</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04820">boosting</a> framework can achieve low regret guarantees based on the learners’ individual regret values.</p>
<p>However, online learning can become more challenging when our actions have consequences on the environment. This can be illustrated with the following experiment: imagine learning to balance a long pole on your hand. When you move your hand slightly, the pole tilts. You then move your hand in the opposite direction, and it bounces back and tilts to the other side. One jerk the wrong way might have you struggling for a good few seconds to rebalance. In other words, a <u>sequence of decisions</u> you made earlier determines whether or not the pole is balanced at any given time, rather than the single decision you make at that point.<img src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/image.jpeg?w=136&amp;h=129" title="" height="129" width="136" alt="" class=" aligncenter" /></p>
<p>More generally, consider cases when our environment has a <b>state, </b>and is in some sense “remembering” our past choices. A stateful framework, able to model a wide range of such phenomena, is a <i>dynamical system</i>. A dynamical system can be thought of as a function that determines, given the current state, what the state of the system will be in the next time step. Think of the physical dynamics that determines our pole’s position based on sequential hand movements. Other intuitive examples are the fluctuations of stock prices in the stock market, or the local weather temperatures; these can all be modeled with dynamical systems.</p>
<p>So how can boosting help us make better predictions for a dynamical system? In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08720">recent work</a> we propose an algorithm, which we refer to as DynaBoost, that achieves this goal. In the paper we provide theoretical regret bounds, as well as an empirical evaluation in a variety of applications, such as online control and time-series prediction.</p>
<p><b>Learning for Online Control</b></p>
<p>Control theory is a field of applied mathematics that deals with the control of various physical processes and engineering systems. The objective is to design an action rule, or <i>controller</i>, for a dynamical system such that steady state values are achieved quickly, and the system maintains stability.</p>
<p>Consider a simple Linear Dynamical System (LDS):</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bt%2B1%7D+%3D+A+x_t+%2B+B+u_t+%2B+w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x_{t+1} = A x_t + B u_t + w_t" class="latex" title="x_{t+1} = A x_t + B u_t + w_t" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t%2Cu_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x_t,u_t" class="latex" title="x_t,u_t" /> are the state and control values at time t, respectively. Assume a known transition dynamics specified by the matrices A and B, and an arbitrary disturbance to the system given by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="w_t" class="latex" title="w_t" />. The goal of the controller is to minimize a convex cost function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_t%28x_t%2Cu_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="c_t(x_t,u_t)" class="latex" title="c_t(x_t,u_t)" />.</p>
<p>A provably optimal controller for the Gaussian noise case (where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="w_t" class="latex" title="w_t" /> are normally distributed) and when the cost functions are quadratic, is the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). LQR computes a pre-fixed matrix K such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t%5E%7BLQR%7D+%3D+K+x_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u_t^{LQR} = K x_t" class="latex" title="u_t^{LQR} = K x_t" />. In other words, LQR computes a linear controller – which linearly maps the state into a control at every time step.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/agarwal19c/agarwal19c.pdf">recent advancement</a> in online control considers <i>arbitrary</i> disturbances, as opposed to normally distributed noise. In this more general setting, there is no closed form for the optimal controller. Instead, it is proposed to use a weighted sum of previously observed noises, i.e., <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t%5E%7BWL%7D+%3D+K+x_t+%2B+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5EH+M_i+w_%7Bt-i%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u_t^{WL} = K x_t + \sum_{i=1}^H M_i w_{t-i} " class="latex" title="u_t^{WL} = K x_t + \sum_{i=1}^H M_i w_{t-i} " /> , where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_1%2C...%2CM_H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="M_1,...,M_H" class="latex" title="M_1,...,M_H" /> are learned parameters, updated in an online fashion. This method is shown to attain vanishing average regret compared to the best fixed linear controller in hindsight, and is applicable for general convex cost functions as opposed to only quadratics.</p>
<p>Crucially, the state-dependent term <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Kx_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="Kx_t" class="latex" title="Kx_t" /> is not learned. Since the learned parameters of the above controller therefore considers only a fixed number of recent disturbances, we can apply existing <a href="http://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu/">online convex optimization</a> techniques developed for <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6025-online-learning-for-adversaries-with-memory-price-of-past-mistakes">learning with loss functions that have bounded memory</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Boosting for Online Control</strong></p>
<p>Using the insights described above to remove state in online control, we can now use techniques from online boosting. DynaBoost maintains multiple copies of the base-controller above, with each copy corresponding to one stage in boosting. At every time step, the control <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u_t" class="latex" title="u_t" /> is obtained from a convex combination of the base-controllers’ outputs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_t%5E%7BWL%281%29%7D%2C...%2Cu_t%5E%7BWL%28N%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u_t^{WL(1)},...,u_t^{WL(N)}" class="latex" title="u_t^{WL(1)},...,u_t^{WL(N)}" />. To update each base-controller’s parameters, DynaBoost feeds each controller with a <i>residual</i> <i>proxy </i>cost function, and seeks to obtain a minimizing point in the direction of the residual loss function’s gradient. Stability ensures that minimizing regret over the proxy costs (which have finite memory) suffices to minimize overall regret. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08720">our paper</a> for the detailed description of the algorithm and its regret guarantees.</p>
<p><strong>Sanity check experiment</strong></p>
<p>We first conducted experiments for the standard LQR setting with i.i.d. Gaussian noise and known dynamics. We applied our boosting method to the non-optimal controller with learned parameters (Control-WL), and we observe that boosting improves its loss and achieves near-optimal performance (here the optimal controller is given by the fixed LQR solution). We have tested an LDS of different dimensions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d+%3D+1%2C10%2C100&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="d = 1,10,100" class="latex" title="d = 1,10,100" />, and averaged results over multiple runs.</p>
<p><img width="624" alt="" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/null.png?w=624&amp;h=182" title="" height="182" /></p>
<p><strong>Correlated noise experiment</strong></p>
<p>When the disturbances are not independently drawn, the LQR controller is not guaranteed to perform optimally. We experimented with two LDS settings with correlated disturbances in which (a) the disturbances <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="w_t" class="latex" title="w_t" /> are generated from a Gaussian random-walk, and (b) where they are generated by a sine function applied to the time index. In these cases, boosted controllers perform better compared to the “weak” learned controller, and can also outperform the fixed LQR solution. We have also tested a Recurrent Neural Network, and observed that boosting is effective for RNNs as well.</p>

<p><strong>Inverted Pendulum experiment</strong></p>
<p>A more challenging experiment with a non-linear dynamical system is the Inverted Pendulum experiment. This is very similar to the pole balancing example we discussed above, and is a standard benchmark for control methods. The goal is to balance the inverted pendulum by applying torque that will stabilize it in a vertically upright position, in the presence of noise. In our experiments, we used correlated disturbances from a Gaussian random-walk. We follow the dynamics implemented in <a href="https://gym.openai.com/">OpenAI Gym</a>, and test the performance of different controllers: LQR, a learned controller, and boosting. The video below visualizes this experiment:</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"></div>
<p>When averaging the loss value over multiple experiment runs, we get the following plot:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="369" alt="" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/null-2.png?w=369&amp;h=276" title="" height="276" /></p>
<p>It can be seen that the learned controller performs much better than the LQR in the presence of correlated noise, and that boosting can improve its stability and achieve lower average loss.</p>
<p><b>Boosting for Time-Series Prediction</b></p>
<p>Similarly to the control setting, in time-series prediction tasks it is sufficient to use fixed horizons, and online boosting can be efficiently applied here as well. In time-series prediction, the data is often assumed to be generated from an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bt%7D+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5Ek+%5Calpha_i+x_%7Bt-i%7D+%2B+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5Eq+%5Cbeta_j+w_j+%2B+w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x_{t} = \sum_{i=1}^k \alpha_i x_{t-i} + \sum_{j=1}^q \beta_j w_j + w_t" class="latex" title="x_{t} = \sum_{i=1}^k \alpha_i x_{t-i} + \sum_{j=1}^q \beta_j w_j + w_t" /></p>
<p>In words, each data point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x_t" class="latex" title="x_t" /> is given by a weighted sum of previous points, previous noises and a new noise term <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="w_t" class="latex" title="w_t" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%2C%5Cbeta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\alpha,\beta" class="latex" title="\alpha,\beta" /> are the coefficients vectors.</p>
<p>To test our boosting method, We experimented with 4 simulated settings: 1) normally distributed noises, 2) coefficients of the dynamical system slowly change over time, 3) a single, abrupt, change of the coefficients, and, 4) correlated noise: Gaussian random walk.</p>
<p>The weak learners tested here are the ARMA-ONS (online newton step) and ARMA-OGD (online gradient descent) algorithms for time-series prediction (See <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v30/Anava13.pdf">this</a> paper for more details). We applied our boosting method, as well as a fast version of it, which applies to quadratic loss functions (we used squared difference in this case).</p>
<p><i><b>1) Gaussian Noise </b></i> <i><b>2) Changing Coefficients</b></i></p>
<p><img width="289" alt="" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/null-3.png?w=289&amp;h=217" title="" height="217" /><img width="289" alt="" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/null-4.png?w=289&amp;h=217" title="" height="217" /><img width="292" alt="" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/null-5.png?w=292&amp;h=218" title="" height="218" /><img width="290" alt="" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/null-6.png?w=290&amp;h=217" title="" height="217" /></p>
<p><i><b>3) Abrupt Change </b></i> <i><b>4) Correlated Noise</b></i></p>
<p>We can see in the plots above that all weak learners’ loss values (red) can be improved by online boosting methods (blue). A similar observation arises when experimenting with real-world data; we experimented with the Air Quality dataset from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php">UCI Machine Learning repository</a>, that contains hourly averaged measurements of air quality properties from an Italian city throughout one year, as measured by chemical sensors. We apply similar weak learners to this task, as well as our boosting algorithms. Here we again obtain better averaged losses for boosted methods (blue) compared to the baselines (red).</p>

<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p class="justify-text">Optimizing a quadratic function is often considered “easy” as it is equivalent to solving a linear system, for which many algorithms exist. Thus, reformulating a non-quadratic optimization problem into a sequence of quadratic problems is a natural idea.</p>



<p class="justify-text">While the standard generic way is Newton method, which is adapted to smooth (at least twice-differentiable) functions, another quite generic way is to use what I have been calling within my lab the “η-trick”. </p>



<p class="justify-text">This can be applied to non-smooth functions, and the simplest version is based on this simple identity: $$ |w| = \min_{ \eta \geq 0 } \frac{1}{2} \frac{w^2}{\eta} + \frac{1}{2} \eta, $$ with the optimal \(\eta\) being equal to \(|w|\) (a simple proof comes from “completing the square”, \(\frac{1}{2} \frac{w^2}{\eta} + \frac{1}{2} \eta = \frac{1}{2} \frac{(|w| – \eta)^2}{\eta} + |w|\), for another proof, simply differentiate with respect to \(\eta\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We thus obtain a variational formulation of \(|w|\) as the minimum over \(\eta\) of a quadratic function in \(w\), as shown below for four values of \(\eta\).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="412" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/etatrick_1d-1-1024x523.png" class="wp-image-502" height="210" /></figure></div>



<h2>Application to Lasso / basis pursuit</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The most classical application is the Lasso problem (as proposed in [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1500-outcomes-of-the-equivalence-of-adaptive-ridge-with-least-absolute-shrinkage.pdf">3</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.0575">4</a>]): $$\min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^d} \frac{1}{2n} \| y – X w \|_2^2 + \lambda \| w\|_1,$$ where \(X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}\) is the design matrix (input variables), \(y \in \mathbb{R}^n\) the vector of responses (output variable), \(\| \cdot \|_2\) the \(\ell_2\)-norm defined through \(\|z\|_2^2 = \sum_{j=1}^d z_j^2\), and \(\|w\|_1 = \sum_{j=1}^d |w_j|\) is the \(\ell_1\)-norm, which is known to be “sparsity-inducing” (that is, it leads to many zero values in the minimizer \(w\) if \(\lambda\) is large enough). </p>



<p class="justify-text">With the variational formulation above applied to each \(w_j\), we get  $$ \min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^d} \frac{1}{2n} \| y – X w \|_2^2 + \lambda \| w\|_1 = \min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^d} \min_{\eta \in \mathbb{R}_+^d} \frac{1}{2n} \| y – X w \|_2^2 +  \frac{\lambda}{2} \sum_{j=1}^d \frac{w_j^2}{\eta_j} + \frac{\lambda}{2} \sum_{j=1}^d \eta_j.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The key aspect of the variational formulation as a <em>minimization </em>problem is that we obtain a joint minimization problem in the variables \((w,\eta)\), for which we can consider alternating optimization (i.e., alternating between minimizing with respect to \(w\) and minimizing with respect to \(\eta\)). The optimum with respect to \(\eta\) is obtained as \(\eta_j = |w_j|\), and the optimization with respect to \(w\) is also simple because of the overall linear/quadratic dependence. The gradient with respect to \(w\) is equal to $$ \frac{1}{n}X^\top ( X w – y ) + \lambda{\rm Diag}(\eta)^{-1} w ,$$ and thus the zero gradient solution can be obtained by solving the linear system \(\big( \frac{1}{n} X^\top X + \lambda {\rm Diag}(\eta)^{-1} \big) w = \frac{1}{n} X^\top y\). This leads to a two-line (in Python or Matlab) algorithm for solving the Lasso problem. For more details on avoiding convergence issues around zero values of \(\eta\) or \(w\), and on solving the linear system efficiently and robustly, see the two monographs <a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/bach_jenatton_mairal_obozinski_FOT.pdf">[1, Section 5]</a> and <a href="http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/resources/pdf/review_sparse_arxiv.pdf">[2, Section 5.4]</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Another nice aspect of the variational formulation above is that it is <em>jointly convex</em> in \((w,\eta),\) and hence traditional optimization algorithms are <em>globally</em> convergent.</p>



<p class="justify-text">This formulation as a “min-min” problem should be contrasted with the classical variational formulation of the \(\ell_1\)-norm as a maximum, that is, \(\|w\|_1 = \max_{ \|s\|_\infty \leq 1} w^\top s\), which would lead to a “min-max” problem (which leads also to a suite of interpretations and algorithms, but this is for another post).</p>



<p class="justify-text">There is another classical formulation for the <em>squared</em> \(\ell_1\)-norm through $$ \| w\|_1^2 =\min_{ \eta \in \Delta_d}  \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^d \frac{w_j^2}{\eta_j},$$ where \(\Delta_d = \{ \eta \in \mathbb{R}_+^d, \ \sum_{j=1}^d \eta_j = 1\}\) is the simplex in \(\mathbb{R}^d\).  Thus the squared \(\ell_1\)-norm is the minimum of squared weighted \(\ell_2\)-norms. This leads to the simple geometric interpretation (below in two dimensions).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="588" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/L1ball_two.png" class="wp-image-293" height="279" />The \(\ell_1\)-ball in green can be obtained as the union of properly scaled ellipsoids with principal axes parallel to the coordinate axes (like the two depicted in pink). For any point on the boundary of the \(\ell_1\)-ball, the enclosed ellipsoid can be made to contain the point.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">While the η-trick is most easy for the \(\ell_1\)-norm, it applies to many other situations which I describe below.</p>



<h2>Extension to “subquadratic” norms</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Given the representation of the \(\ell_1\)-norm as a quadratic function, one may wonder if this can be extended to other norms. In order to preserve the homogeneity of a norm \(\Omega\) defined on \(\mathbb{R}^d\), a natural generalization is a representation in the form $$\Omega(w) = \min_{ \eta \in \mathbb{R}_+^d}  \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^d \frac{w_j^2}{\eta_j} + \frac{1}{2} f(\eta),$$ where \(f\) is convex and \(1\)-homogeneous (then a constrained optimization formulation for \(\Omega(w)^2\) can then also be derived, with the simplex replaced by a level set of \(f\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Given that a minimum of linear functions is concave, we see that a necessary condition for the existence of such a parameterization is that \(\Omega(w)\) is a concave function of \(w \circ w = (w_1^2,\dots,w_d^2)\). It turns out that this is also a sufficient condition, and that the function \(f\) can be obtained from \(\Omega\) using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_conjugate">Fenchel conjugacy</a>  (see <a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/bach_jenatton_mairal_obozinski_FOT.pdf">[1, Section 1.4.2]</a>). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Examples include various group norms of the forms \(\Omega(w) = \sum_{G \in \mathcal{G}} \| w_G \|_2\), where \(\mathcal{G}\) is a set of subsets of \(\{1,\dots,d\}\) and \(\| w_G\|_2\) is the \(\ell_2\)-norm of the subvector \(w_G\) obtained from \(w\) by only keeping the components whose indices are in \(G\) (this form of “group penalty” is common in structured sparsity <a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/bach_jenatton_mairal_obozinski_FOT.pdf">[1, Section 1.3]</a> where one wants to force of lot of zeros in \(w\), but also wants to encourage some specific patterns in the set of non-zero components). Thus, for all of these, one can derive simple estimation algorithms with a sequence of least-squares problems (there is another connection with multiple kernel learning <a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/bach_jenatton_mairal_obozinski_FOT.pdf">[1, Section 1.5]</a>, see future posts).</p>



<h2>Extensions to all norms</h2>



<p class="justify-text">This trick can in fact be extended to all norms, but this requires a non-diagonal Hessian for the quadratic term, where \({\rm Diag}(\eta)\) now becomes a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix \(\Lambda\): $$\Omega(w) = \min_{ \Lambda \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d} }  \frac{1}{2} w^\top \Lambda^{-1} w + \frac{1}{2} g(\Lambda),$$ see <a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/bach_jenatton_mairal_obozinski_FOT.pdf">[1, Section 5.2]</a> for more details, where an explicit candidate for the function \(g(\Lambda)\) is given. Here, we impose that \(g(\Lambda)\) is infinite when \(\Lambda\) is not positive semi-definite (to make the quadratic function in \(w\) convex).</p>



<p class="justify-text">For example, for the \(\ell_\infty\)-ball below, the ellipsoid has axes which are not parallel anymore to the coordinate axes).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="271" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Linfball-1.png" class="wp-image-262" height="257" /></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We can also consider the total variation penalty of the form \( \Omega(w) = \sum_{i,j} d_{ij} |w_i – w_j|,\) where the \(d_{ij}\)’s are positive weights. It is commonly used to encourage piecewise constant vectors \(w\). The η-trick can be applied to all terms \(|w_i – w_j|\) <a href="https://www.sam.math.ethz.ch/sam_reports/reports_final/reports2014/2014-39.pdf">[7]</a>. This leads to algorithms solving Laplacian systems for which particularly efficient randomized methods are available (see, e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.02353">[8]</a>).</p>



<h2>Extension to spectral norms</h2>



<p class="justify-text">When dealing with a spectral norm on a matrix \(W \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}\), that is a norm that depends only on the singular values of \(W\),  then one has a specific representation. For example, for the nuclear norm \(\| W\|_\ast\), which is equal to the sum of singular values of \(W\) and encourages matrices with low-rank: $$\| W\|_\ast = \min_{ \Lambda \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}}  \frac{1}{2} {\rm tr} \big( W \Lambda^{-1} W^\top \big) + \frac{1}{2} { \rm tr} \Lambda,$$ with the constraint that \(\Lambda\) is symmetric positive semi-definite. This leads to simple least-squares based algorithms for nuclear norm minimization <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3143-multi-task-feature-learning.pdf">[5]</a>.</p>



<h2>Extensions to non-convex penalties</h2>



<p class="justify-text">As mentioned above, a necessary condition for a variational representation of a function \(w \mapsto \varphi(w)\) as a minimum of quadratic functions with diagonal Hessians is the concavity in \(w \circ w\) (the vector composed of squares of the components of \(w\)). Other functions beyond norms or squared norms can be considered, such as the following non-convex penalty: $$\frac{1}{\alpha} \| w\|_\alpha^\alpha = \inf_{\eta \in \mathbb{R}_+^d} \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^d \frac{w_j^2}{\eta_j }  + \frac{1}{2\beta } \| \eta \|_\beta^\beta, $$ where for any \(\gamma &gt;0\), \(\| w\|_\gamma^\gamma = \sum_{j=1}^d |w_j|^\gamma\), \(\alpha \in (0,2)\) and \(\beta = \frac{\alpha}{2-\alpha} &gt;0 \). These penalties are commonly used to enhance the sparsity-inducing effect of the \(\ell_1\)-norm or more generally all sparsity-inducing norms: by being non convex penalties (when \(\alpha \in (0,1)\)), they can be more aggressive in setting components of \(w\) to zero (as can be seen below through the “corners” of the corresponding ball being more “pointy”).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The minimizer \(\eta\) above can be obtained in closed form as \(\eta_j = |w_j |^{2-\alpha}\), and thus the same alternating optimization algorithm can be used. Moreover, the geometric interpretation in terms of enclosing ellipsoids for level sets of \(\| w\|_\alpha\) still holds but this is not anymore a convex set. See below for the unit ball of \(\| \cdot \|_{1/2}\).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="261" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/L1onehalf.png" class="wp-image-277" height="247" /></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">This leads to reweighted least-squares algorithms when using those penalties, again based on alternating minimization with respect to \(w\) and \(\eta\) [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.0575">4</a>, <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v9/jenatton10a/jenatton10a.pdf">6</a>]. A key difference with the convex case is that the optimization problem is not jointly convex in \((w,\eta)\) anymore, and it typically only converges to a local optimum. Note here that reweighted-\(\ell_1\) algorithms (that use a sequence of weighted \(\ell_1\)-regularized problems) are also commonly used, see <a href="http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/resources/pdf/review_sparse_arxiv.pdf">[2, Section 5.3]</a>.</p>



<h2>Beyond regularization penalties</h2>



<p class="justify-text">While I focused primarily on regularizers, can we apply this to the loss as well? Using the same recipe, “concavity in the squared arguments”, we get naturally new representations, which can be used in particular for optimization purposes.</p>



<p class="justify-text">A notable one is for the logistic function \(\varphi(u) = \log(1+e^{-u})\) used within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic regression</a>, which can be written as \(\varphi(u) = -\frac{u}{2} + \log( e^{u/2} + e^{-u/2})\), with the function \(u \mapsto \log( e^{u/2} + e^{-u/2})\) being convex in \(u^2\) (which can be shown by computing the second-order derivative). This leads to the representation <a href="http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~scs/Courses/Stat376/Papers/Variational/JaakkolaJordan2000.pdf">[9]</a> $$ \log( e^{u/2} + e^{-u/2}) = \min_{v \in \mathbb{R}}\ \  \log( e^{v/2} + e^{-v/2}) + \frac{ \tanh \frac{v}{2}}{4v} ( u^2 – v^2 ),$$ which is a quadratic variational representation that could be used to optimize the logistic regression objective function (in particular within surrogate function methods commonly used for online dictionary learning, see <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume11/mairal10a/mairal10a.pdf">[10]</a>) or for variational inference <a href="http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~scs/Courses/Stat376/Papers/Variational/JaakkolaJordan2000.pdf">[9]</a> (note here that the joint convexity in \(u\) and the inverse of the parameter of the quadratic function is gone).</p>



<p class="justify-text">As shown below, the quadratic upper-bound can be contrasted with (a) the second-order Taylor expansion (thus with matching first <em>two</em> derivatives), which is not an upper-bound (and thus may not lead to global convergence when used for optimization, that is, when Newton method is used), and (b) the upper-bound obtained from the uniform bound \(1/4\) on the second-derivative, which is weaker in particular for large values of \(u\) (and corresponds to using the traditional notion of smoothness of the objective function).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="414" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/logistic_other-1024x586.png" class="wp-image-442" height="236" />Variational formulation for the logistic function (in red for a single value of \(v\)), compared to other approximations which are tight at the same \(v\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Now, you can go ahead and use the η-trick within your optimization problems. But it goes beyond and it pops out in other areas in machine learning, in particular for multiple kernel learning, super-Gaussian distributions and convex relaxations of combinatorial penalties. These will be the topics of future posts.</p>

<p class="justify-text">I have finally found time to start a blog. Although I don’t know if I will find the energy to do all this in the next few months, I am planning to use this blog in a variety of ways, with one post every first monday of the month:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>To develop in reasonable depth some ideas and concepts from machine learning and associated fields. This can go from general machine learning concepts (e.g., convex optimization) to more specialized topics (e.g., bias-variance trade-offs in stochastic gradient descent). The choice of topics will obviously be oriented towards my scientific interests and research.</li><li>To present nice mathematical tools or tricks which I find cute, elegant and/or efficient, which I have encountered in recent years while reading (or writing) machine learning papers. The number of such tricks seems to be infinite and (spoiler alert for the students taking my classes) and are a good source of exam questions.</li><li>To discuss any moderately research-oriented topics related to my various past and present roles as researcher, PhD advisor, reviewer, journal editor, conference area chair, conference organizer, etc.</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">Many other blogs which have been following for quite a while have been a source of inspiration and motivation: <a href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/">I am a bandit</a>, <a href="http://hunch.net/">hunch.net</a>, <a href="http://djalil.chafai.net/blog/">Libre pensée</a>.</p></div>

<p>On the Importance of Disciplinary Pride for Multidisciplinary Collaboration</p>
<p>I am a big fan of collaborations, even if they <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2014/07/01/collaboration-competition-and-competition-within-collaboration/">come with their own challenges</a>. I always got further and enjoyed research much more because of my collaborators. I’m forever indebted to so many colleagues and dear, dear friends. Each and every one of them was better than me in some ways. To contribute, I had to remember my own strengths and bring them to the table. The premise of this post is that the same holds for collaboration between fields. It should be read as a call for theoreticians to bring the tools and the powerful way of thinking of TOC into collaborations. We shouldn’t be blind to the limitation of our field but obsessing on those limitations is misguided and would only limit our impact. Instead we should bring our best and trust on the other disciplines we collaborate with to do the same (allowing each to complement and compensate for the other).</p>
<p>The context in which these thoughts came to my mind is Algorithmic Fairness. In this and other areas on the interface between society and computing, true <a href="https://theorydish.blog/2018/11/01/simons-cluster-on-algorithmic-fairness/">collaboration is vital</a>. Not surprisingly, attending multidisciplinary programs on Algorithm Fairness, is a major part of my professional activities these days. And I love it – I get to learn so much from people and disciplines that have been thinking about fairness for many decades and centuries. In addition, the Humanities are simply splendid. Multidisciplinary collaborations come with even more challenges than other collaborations: the language, tools and perspectives are different. But for exactly the same reasons they can be even more rewarding. Nevertheless, my fear and the reason for this post is that my less experienced TOC colleagues might come out from those interdisciplinary meetings frustrated and might lose confidence in what TOC can contribute. It feels to me that <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/PDF/toc-sp2.pdf">old lessons</a> about the value of TOC need to be learned again. There is a lot to be proud of, and holding to this pride would in fact make us better collaborators not worse.</p>
<p>In the context of Algorithmic Fairness, we should definitely acknowledge (as we often do) that science exists within political structures, that algorithms are not objective and that mathematical definitions cannot replace social norms as expressed by policy makers. But let’s not take these as excuses for inaction and let’s not withdraw to the role of spectators. In this era of algorithms, other disciplines need us just as much as we need them .</p>

<p>Spring semester is over, yay! To celebrate summer, I’ve compiled lecture notes from the graduate course COS 598D, a.k.a. “<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/optimization4machinelearning/home">optimization for machine learning</a>“.</p>
<p>The course is an aftermath of a few lectures and summer school tutorials given in various locations, in which  lectures goal of the course was to present the most useful methods and ideas in a rigorous-but-not-tedious way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suitable for a mathematically-prepared undergraduate student, and/or researcher beginning their endeavor into machine learning.</li>
<li>Focus on the important: we start with stochastic gradient descent for training deep neural networks.</li>
<li>Bring out the main ideas: i.e. projection-free methods, second-order optimization, the three main acceleration techniques, qualitatively discuss the advantages and applicability of each.</li>
<li>*short* proofs, that everyone can follow and extend in their future research. I prefer being off by a constant/log factor from the best known bound with a more insightful proof.</li>
<li>Not loose track of the goal: generalization/regret, rather than final accuracy. This means we talked about online learning, generalization and precision issues in ML.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is still work in progress, please feel free to send me typos/corrections, as well as other topics you’d like to see (on my todos already: lower bounds, quasi-convexity, and the homotopy method).</p>
<p>Note: zero-order/bandit optimization is an obvious topic that’s not address. The reason is purely subjective – it appears as a chapter in <a href="http://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu/">this textbook</a> (that also started as lecture notes!).</p>

<p>While I’m a relative newcomer to differential privacy (my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10127">first paper</a> on it was only in 2017), I’ve found the community to be a pleasure to interact with: paradoxically, simultaneously tight-knit yet highly welcoming to newcomers. I partially credit this culture to the number of workshops and programs which bring people together, including, but not limited to, <a href="https://www.birs.ca/events/2018/5-day-workshops/18w5189">a BIRS workshop</a>, <a href="https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/">the Privacy Tools project at Harvard</a>, <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/privacy2019">a semester at the Simons Institute</a>, <a href="https://shonan.nii.ac.jp/seminars/164/">the forthcoming Shonan workshop</a>, and <a href="https://tpdp.cse.buffalo.edu/">the Theory and Practice of Differential Privacy (TPDP) Workshop</a>.</p>



<p>I’m writing this post to draw attention to the imminent deadline of <a href="https://tpdp.cse.buffalo.edu/2019/">TPDP 2019</a>, co-located with CCS 2019 in London. I’ll spare you the full details (click the link for more information), but most pressing is the deadline tomorrow, June 21, 2019, anywhere on Earth (let me know if this presents hardship for you, and I can pass concerns on to the chair). Essentially anything related to the theory or practice of differential privacy is welcome. Submissions are limited to four pages in length and are lightly refereed, based on originality, relevance, interest, and clarity. There are no published proceedings, and previously published results are welcome. If you’ve been looking to get to know the community, consider either submitting or attending the workshop! </p></div>

<p><em>by <a href="http://www.abbyvansoest.com/">Abby van Soest</a> and Elad Hazan, based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02690">this paper</a> </em></p>
<p>When humans interact with the environment, we receive a series of signals that indicate the value of our actions. We know that chocolate tastes good, sunburns feel bad, and certain actions generate praise or disapproval from others. Generally speaking, we learn from these signals and adapt our behavior in order to get more positive “rewards” and fewer negative ones.</p>
<p><i>Reinforcement learning</i> (RL) is a sub-field of machine learning that formally models this setting of learning through interaction in a reactive environment. In RL, we have an <b>agent</b> and an <b>environment</b>. The agent observes its position (or “state”) in the environment and takes actions that transition it to a new state. The environment looks at an agent’s state and hands out rewards based on a hidden set of criteria.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="360" alt="" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/null.png?w=360&amp;h=145" title="" height="145" /></p>
<p><i>Source: <a href="http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf">Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction</a>. Sutton &amp; Barto, 2017.</i></p>
<p>Typically, the goal of RL is for the agent to learn behavior that maximizes<i> </i>the total reward it receives from the environment. This methodology has led to some notable successes: machines have learned how to<a href="https://deepmind.com/research/publications/playing-atari-deep-reinforcement-learning/"> play Atari games</a>, how to <a href="https://sigmoidal.io/alphago-how-it-uses-reinforcement-learning-to-beat-go-masters/">beat human masters</a> of Go, and how to write <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18224704/ai-machine-learning-language-models-read-write-openai-gpt2">long-form responses</a> to an essay prompt.</p>
<h2>But what can we learn without an external reward signal?</h2>
<p>It seems like a paradoxical question to ask, given that RL is all about rewards. But even though the reward paradigm is fundamentally flexible in many ways, it is also brittle and limits the agent’s ability to learn about its environment. This is due to several reasons. First, a reward signal directs the agents towards a single specific goal that may not generalize. Second, the reward signal may be sparse and uninformative, as we illustrate below.</p>
<p>Imagine that you want a robot to learn to navigate through the following maze.</p>
<p><b>Case 1: Sparse Rewards.</b> The agent gets a reward of +1 when it exits the maze, and a reward of 0 everywhere else. The agent doesn’t learn anything until it stumbles upon the exit.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">⇒ Clear reward signals are not always available.</p>
<p><b>Case 2: Misleading Rewards.</b> The agent gets a reward of +1 at the entrance and a reward of +10 at the exit. The agent incorrectly learns to sit at the entrance because it hasn’t explored its environment sufficiently.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">⇒ Rewards can <i>prevent</i> discovery of the full environment.</p>
<p>These issues are easy to overcome in the small maze on the left. But what about the maze on the right? As the size of the environment grows, it’ll get harder and harder to find the correct solution — the intractability of the problem scales exponentially.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="244" alt="" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/image.png?w=244&amp;h=238" title="" height="238" /><img src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/pasted-image-0.png?w=1100" alt="pasted image 0.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-130" /></p>
<p>So what we find is that there is power<i> </i>in being able to learn effectively in the <b>absence</b> of rewards. This intuition is supported by a body of research that shows learning fails when rewards aren’t dense or are <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/cs287-fa09/readings/NgHaradaRussell-shaping-ICML1999.pdf">poorly shaped</a>; and fixing these problems can require substantial engineering effort.</p>
<p>By enabling agents to discover the environment without the requirement of a reward signal, we create a more<b> flexible and generalizable</b> form of reinforcement learning. This framework can be considered a form of “unsupervised” RL. Rather than relying on explicit and inherently limited signals (or “labels”), we can deal with a broad, unlabelled pool of data. Learning from this pool facilitates a more general extraction of knowledge from the environment.</p>
<h2>Our new approach: Maximum Entropy</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02690">recent work</a>, we propose finding a policy that maximizes entropy (which we refer to as a MaxEnt policy), or another related and concave function of the distribution. This objective is reward-independent and favors exploration.</p>
<p>In the video below, a two-dimensional cheetah robot learns to run backwards and forwards, move its legs fast and in all different directions, and even do flips. The cheetah doesn’t have access to any external rewards; it only uses signals from the MaxEnt policy.</p>
<p> </p>
<div style="width: 1100px; height: 620px;" class="video-player" id="v-ro0BDWO4-1">
</div>
<p>Entropy is a function of the distribution over states. A high entropy distribution visits all states with near-equal frequency — it’s a <i>uniform</i> distribution. On the other hand, a low entropy distribution is biased toward visiting some states more frequently than others. (In the maze example, a low entropy distribution would result from the agent sitting at the entrance of the maze forever.)</p>
<p><img src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/sladx3i4fcsebwejbiohb_g.png?w=1100" alt="slAdX3I4FcseBWeJbioHb_g.png" class=" size-full wp-image-129 aligncenter" /></p>
<p>So given that policy <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\pi" class="latex" title="\pi" /> creates a distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d_%5Cpi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="d_\pi" class="latex" title="d_\pi" /> over states, the problem we are hoping to solve is:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%5E%2A+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmax_%7B%5Cpi%7D+%5Ctext%7Bentropy%7D%28d_%5Cpi%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\pi^* = \arg \max_{\pi} \text{entropy}(d_\pi) " class="latex" title="\pi^* = \arg \max_{\pi} \text{entropy}(d_\pi) " /></p>
<p>When we know all the states, actions, and dynamics of a given environment, finding the policy with maximum entropy is a concave optimization problem. This type of problem can be easily and exactly solved by convex programming.</p>
<p>But we very rarely have all that knowledge available to use. In practice, one of several complications usually arise:</p>
<ol>
<li>The states are <b>non-linearly approximated </b>by a neural network or some other function approximator.</li>
<li>The transition dynamics are unknown.</li>
<li>The state space is intractably large. (As an interesting example, the game of Go has more than<b> one googol or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B100%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="10^{100}" class="latex" title="10^{100}" /></b> possible states. That’s more than the number of atoms in the universe, according to <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/01/alphago-mastering-ancient-game-of-go.html">this blog</a> from 2016, and definitely more than can fit on a computer.)</li>
</ol>
<p>In such cases, the problem of finding a max-entropy policy becomes non-convex and computationally hard.</p>
<p>So what to do? If we look at many practical RL problems (Atari, OpenAI Gym), we see that there are many known, efficient solvers that can construct an optimal (or nearly-optimal) policy when they are <i>given a reward signal</i>.</p>
<p>We thus consider an <i>oracle model</i>: let’s assume that we have access to one of these solvers, so that we can pass it an explicit reward vector and receive an optimal policy in return. Can we now maximize entropy in a provably efficient way? In other words, is it possible to reduce this high complexity optimization problem to that of “standard” RL?</p>
<p>Our approach does exactly that! It is based on the Frank-Wolfe method. This is a gradient-based optimization algorithm that is particularly suited for oracle-based optimization. Instead of moving in the direction of the steepest decline of the objective function, the Frank-Wolfe method iteratively moves in the direction of the optimal point in the direction of the gradient. This is depicted below (and deserves a separate post…). The Frank-Wolfe method is a projection-free algorithm, see <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GIDnw7T-NT4Do3eC0B5kYJlzwOs6nzIO/view">this exposition</a> about its theoretical properties.</p>

<p>For the exact specification of the algorithm and its performance guarantee, see<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02690"> our paper</a>.</p>
<h2>Experiments</h2>
<p>To complement the theory, we also created some experiments to test the MaxEnt algorithm on simulated robotic locomotion tasks (<a href="https://github.com/abbyvansoest/maxent/tree/refactor">open source code available here</a>). We used test environments from <a href="https://gym.openai.com/">OpenAI Gym</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py">Mujoco</a> and trained MaxEnt experts for various environments.</p>
<p>These are some results from the Humanoid experiment, where the agent is a human-like bipedal robot. The behavior of the MaxEnt agent (blue) is baselined against a random agent (orange), who explores by sampling randomly from the environment. This random approach is often used in practice for epsilon-greedy RL exploration.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="442" alt="" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/null-1.png?w=442&amp;h=332" title="" height="332" /></p>
<p>In this figure, we see that over the course of 25 epochs, the MaxEnt agent progressively increases the total entropy over the state space.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="460" alt="" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/null-2.png?w=460&amp;h=345" title="" height="345" /></p>
<p>Here, we see a visualization of the Humanoid’s coverage of the $xy$-plane, where the shown plane is of size 40-by-40. After one epoch, there is <b>minimal</b> coverage of the area. But by the 5th, 10th, and 15th epoch, we see that the agent has learned to visit all the different states in the plane, obtaining full and nearly uniform coverage of the grid!</p>

<p><em>[05/25/19 Update: Kevin Hartnett has a nice article at Quanta explaining Natarajan &amp; Wright’s result in slightly more layman terms than I’d be able to…see here: <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-expand-the-frontier-of-verifiable-knowledge-20190523/">Computer Scientists Expand the Frontier of Verifiable Knowledge</a>]</em></p>
<p>The study of entanglement through the length of interactive proof systems has been one of the most productive applications of complexity theory to the physical sciences that I know of. Last week Anand Natarajan and John Wright, postdoctoral scholars at Caltech and MIT respectively, added a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05870">major stone</a> to this line of work. Anand &amp; John (hereafter “NW”) establish the following wild claim: it is possible for a classical polynomial-time verifier to decide membership in any language in <em>non-deterministic doubly exponential time</em> by asking questions to two infinitely powerful, but untrusted, provers sharing entanglement. In symbols, NEEXP <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csubseteq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\subseteq}" class="latex" title="{\subseteq}" /> MIP<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{^\star}" class="latex" title="{^\star}" />! (The last symbol is for emphasis — no, we don’t have an MIP<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{^\star}" class="latex" title="{^\star}" />! class — yet.)</p>
<p>What is amazing about this result is the formidable gap between the complexity of the verifier and the complexity of the language being verified. We know since the 90s that the use of interaction and randomness can greatly expand the power of polynomial-time verifiers, from NP to <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=146609">PSPACE</a> (with a single prover) and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2794945">NEXP</a> (with two provers). As a result of the work of Natarajan and Wright, we now know that yet an additional ingredient, the use of <em>entanglement</em> between the provers, can be leveraged by the verifier — the same verifier as in the previous results, a classical randomized polynomial-time machine — to obtain an exponential increase in its verification power. Randomness and interaction brought us one exponential; entanglement gives us another.</p>
<p>To gain intuition for the result consider first the structure of a classical two-prover one-round interactive proof system for non-deterministic doubly exponential time, with exponential-time verifier. Cutting some corners, such a protocol can be obtained by “scaling up” a standard two-prover protocol for non-deterministic singly exponential time. In the protocol, the verifier would sample a pair of exponential-length questions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" title="{(X,Y)}" />, send <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> to each prover, receive answers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" />, and perform an exponential-time computation that verifies some predicate about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%2CA%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(X,Y,A,B)}" class="latex" title="{(X,Y,A,B)}" />.</p>
<p>How can entanglement help design an <em>exponentially more efficient</em> protocol? At first it may seem like a polynomial-time verifier has no way to even get started: if it can only communicate polynomial-length messages with the provers, how can it leverage their power? And indeed, if the provers are classical, it can’t: it is known that even with a polynomial number of provers, and polynomially many rounds of interaction, a polynomial-time verifier cannot decide any language beyond NEXP.</p>
<p>But the provers in the NW protocol are not classical. They can share entanglement. How can the verifier exploit this to its advantage? The key property that is needed is know as the <em>rigidity</em> of entanglement. In words, rigidity is the idea that by verifying the presence of certain statistical correlations between the provers’ questions and answers the verifier can determine precisely (up to a local change of basis) the quantum state and measurements that the provers must have been using to generate their answers. The most famous example of rigidity is the <em>CHSH game</em>: as already shown by <a href="http://www.numdam.org/item/AIHPA_1988__49_2_215_0/">Werner and Summers</a> in 1982, the CHSH game can only be optimally, or even near-optimally, won by measuring a maximally entangled state using two mutually unbiased bases for each player. No other state or measurements will do, unless they trivially imply an EPR pair and mutually unbiased bases (such as a state that is the tensor product of an EPR pair with an additional entangled state).</p>
<p>Rigidity gives the verifier control over the provers’ use of their entanglement. The simplest use of this is for the verifier to force the provers to share a certain number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" /> of EPR pairs and measure them to obtain identical uniformly distributed <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" />-bit strings. Such a test for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" /> EPR pairs can be constructed from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" /> CHSH games. In a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03821">paper</a> with Natarajan we give a more efficient test that only requires questions and answers of length that is poly-logarithmic in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" />. Interestingly, the test is built on classical machinery — the low-degree test — that plays a central role in the analysis of some classical multi-prover proof systems for NEXP.</p>
<p>At this point we have made an inch of progress: it is possible for a polynomial-time (in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3D%5Clog+N%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n=\log N}" class="latex" title="{n=\log N}" />) verifier to “command” two quantum provers sharing entanglement to share <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%3D2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N=2^n}" class="latex" title="{N=2^n}" /> EPR pairs, and measure them in identical bases to obtain identical uniformly random <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" />-bit strings. What is this useful for? Not much — yet. But here comes the main insight in NW: suppose we could similarly force the provers to generate, not identical uniformly random strings, but a pair of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" />-bit strings <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" title="{(X,Y)}" /> that is distributed as a pair of questions from the verifier in the aforementioned interactive proof system for NEEXP with exponential-time (in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />) verifier. Then we could use a polynomial-time (in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />) verifier to “command” the provers to generate their exponentially-long questions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" title="{(X,Y)}" /> by themselves. The provers would then compute answers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28A%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(A,B)}" class="latex" title="{(A,B)}" /> as in the NEEXP protocol. Finally, they would prove to the verifier, using a polynomial interaction, that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28A%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(A,B)}" class="latex" title="{(A,B)}" /> is a valid pair of answers to the pair of questions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" title="{(X,Y)}" /> — indeed, the latter verification is an NEXP problem, hence can be verified using a protocol with polynomial-time verifier.</p>
<p>Sounds crazy? Yes. But they did it! Of course there are many issues with the brief summary above — for example, how does the verifier even know the questions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%2CY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X,Y}" class="latex" title="{X,Y}" /> sampled by the provers? The answer is that it doesn’t need to know the entire question; only that it was sampled correctly, and that the quadruple <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%2CA%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(X,Y,A,B)}" class="latex" title="{(X,Y,A,B)}" /> satisfies the verification predicate of the exponential-time verifier. This can be verified using a polynomial-time interactive proof.</p>
<p>Diving in, the most interesting insight in the NW construction is what they call “introspection”. What makes multi-prover proof systems powerful is the ability for the verifier to send correlated questions to the provers, in a way such that each prover has only partial information about the other’s question — informally, the verifier plays a variant of prisonner’s dilemma with the provers. In particular, any interesting distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" title="{(X,Y)}" /> will have the property that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> are not fully correlated. For a concrete example think of the “planes-vs-lines” distribution, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> is a uniformly random plane and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> a uniformly random line in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" />. The aforementioned test for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" /> EPR pairs can be used to force both provers to sample the same uniformly random plane <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" />. But how does the verifier ensure that one of the provers “forgets” parts of the plane, to only remember a uniformly random line <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> that is contained in it? NW’s insight is that the information present in a quantum state — such as the prover’s half-EPR pairs — can be “erased” by commanding the prover to perform a measurement in the <em>wrong</em> basis — a basis that is mutually unbiased with the basis used by the other prover to obtain its share of the query. Building on this idea, NW develop a battery of delicate tests that provide the verifier the ability to control precisely what information gets distributed to each prover. This allows a polynomial-time verifier to perfectly simulate the local environment that the exponential-time verifier would have created for the provers in a protocol for NEEXP, thus simulating the latter protocol with exponentially less resources.</p>
<p>One of the aspects of the NW result I like best is that they showed how the “history state barrier” could be overcome. Previous works attempting to establish strong lower bounds on the class MIP<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{^\star}" class="latex" title="{^\star}" />, such as the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12166">paper</a> by Yuen et al., relies on a compression technique that requires the provers to share a history state of the computation performed by a larger protocol. Unfortunately, history states are very non-robust, and as a result such works only succeeded in developing protocols with vanishing completeness-soundness gap. NW entirely bypass the use of history states, and this allows them to maintain a constant gap.</p>
<p>Seven years ago Tsuyoshi Ito and I showed that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0550">MIP<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7D%5E%5Cstar&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{}^\star" class="latex" title="{}^\star" /> contains NEXP</a>. At the time, we thought this may be the end of the story — although it seemed challenging, surely someone would eventually prove a matching upper bound. Natarajan and Wright have defeated this expectation by showing that MIP<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{^\star}" class="latex" title="{^\star}" /> contains NEEXP. What next? NEEEXP? The halting problem? I hope to make this the topic of a future post.</p></div>

<p>In 1788, Lagrange presented a set of equations of motion that, unlike Newtonian mechanics, are independent of the choice of coordinates of the physical system, and ultimately led to the formulation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Hilbert_action">general relativity</a>. Hamilton came up with a different set of equations of motion in 1833 that arguably led to the development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics)">quantum mechanics</a>. Remarkably, in classical mechanics, these sets of equations turn out to be <em>equivalent</em> via a beautiful duality due to <strong>Legendre</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://theory.epfl.ch/celis/HOME.html">Elisa Celis</a> and Nisheeth Vishnoi</em></p>
<p>Elections are the nervous system of a democracy and, hence, issues related to their transparency and fairness are central to healthy societies. However, the number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_controversial_elections">controversial elections</a> has exploded since 2000, and the more recent ones involve the use of the Internet and algorithms — a good excuse for computer scientists to get involved in elections to save democracy!</p>
<p>Last year, the two of us and Lingxao Huang revisited the question of <em>fairness</em> in <em>multi-winner</em> elections<em>. </em>A multi-winner election is one where the objective is to select a committee from a set of candidates based on voter preferences. However, election systems for multi-winner elections have been shown to be <a href="https://www.representwomen.org/voting_rules_pose_barrier_for_women">biased against minorities</a> by giving preference to committees that under-represent their already-small numbers. When the candidates have certain sensitive attributes (such as gender), and different types (e.g., male, female and non-binary) we may instead wish to impose additional requirement so that the winning committee is <em>fair</em>. We considered the problem of finding the committee with the maximum number of votes, subject to such additional fairness requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>But what does it mean to be fair?</em></p>
<p>Is a committee fair when types are equally represented? Or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation">proportionally represented</a>? These questions have received more than a century’s worth of attention in social choice theory and are deeply entangled with culture and politics. In short, fairness means different things in different contexts and rather than addressing a specific instance of this question, we asked ourselves — <em>can we provide a framework in which a user can specify fairness constraints according to their needs and design algorithms that can compute the winning committee accordingly?</em></p>
<p>Because such a framework must handle general classes of constraints, the algorithmic task became more challenging than the usual unconstrained case. If you are interested in understanding our algorithmic and complexity results, they appear in our recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10057.pdf">paper</a> that was presented at IJCAI-ECAI this year.</p>
<p>Clearly, however, there are real merits to providing such generality — earlier this year, our paper caught the eye of members of a <a href="https://appelcitoyen.ch/">people’s movement</a> from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_of_Valais">Valais</a> canton in Switzerland, who were in the process of rethinking elections in their region. They were happy to know that we had solved the exact problem they needed for a primary election and asked us if we would be willing to help them conduct their elections. We were, of course, thrilled!</p>
<p>After an intense collaboration for more than four months, 8 elections that used our framework concluded on September 9, 2018. For us, there were several eye-opening aspects of taking our algorithmic framework from theory to practice. Perhaps the most interesting one was coming up with an answer to:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Who decides what is fair?</em></p>
<p>In this case, it was the voters! Before voting on the committee, a vote to determine the fairness constraints was conducted in each of the eight districts. This vote was in mid-June and also checked if the voters agree to use our algorithmic framework. Since transparency was the key motivation, prior to this vote,  we were invited to a press conference to educate the people about the whole process that resulted in coverage in newspapers <a href="https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/listes-ideales-constituante-valaisanne?itm_source=homepage&amp;itm_medium=position-12">Le Temps</a>,  <a href="https://www.lenouvelliste.ch/articles/valais/canton/appel-citoyen-lance-sa-primaire-digitale-en-vue-de-la-constituante-les-passionnes-de-democratie-ont-jusqu-a-jeudi-pour-s-inscrire-763669">Le Nouvelliste</a>, TV channel <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://canal9.ch/appel-citoyen-va-choisir-ses-candidats-pour-la-lassemblee-constituante-en-deux-etapes-et-par-internet/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1537194868256000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQkC-CmcI2n0iBfAAzxP4GWbiBzQ">Canal 9</a>, and radio channels <a href="http://www.rhonefm.ch/fr/podcasts/journal-du-soir-une-election-primaire-digitale--c-est-l-aventure-dans-laquelle-se-lance-le-mouvement-apolitique-appel-citoyen-en-premiere-mondiale-1107827">Rhone FM</a> and  <a href="http://radiochablais.ch//podcast/mp3/info_12h_13062018.mp3">Radio Chablais</a>.</p>

<p>In the end, the voters decided to place constraints on the gender balance, age demographics, and regions. While all districts approved these same three attributes, the specific constraints varied by district according to their demographics and pre-defined regions. This was a truly open and democratic way to determine the criteria by which the committee was to be balanced. The constraints not only ensured that the outcome would be fair (as defined by the voters) but also encouraged many more women to run for election than the party originally anticipated — in fact, in several districts there were more women than men contesting the election!</p>

<p>This post is meant as a companion to an introductory post I wrote on the <a href="https://quantumfrontiers.com/">blog</a> of Caltech’s IQIM (<a href="http://iqim.caltech.edu/">Institute for Quantum Information and Matter</a>), of which I am a member. The post describes a “summer cluster” on quantum computation that I co-organized with Andrew Childs, Ignacio Cirac, and Umesh Vazirani at the Simons Institute in Berkeley over the past couple months. The IQIM post also describes one of the highlights of the workshop we organized as part of this program: the recent result by Mahadev on <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/Users/Thomas/Dropbox/www/myCQstate/verification2-clean.html">classical verification of quantum computation</a>. The present post is a continuation of <a href="https://quantumfrontiers.com/2018/08/05/the-quantum-wave-in-computing/">that one</a>, so that I would encourage you to read it first. In this post my goal is to give additional detail on Mahadev’s result. For the real thing you should of course read the <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/Users/Thomas/Dropbox/www/myCQstate/verification2-clean.html">paper</a> (you may want to start by watching the author’s <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/urmila-mahadev-06-15-18">beautiful talk</a> at our workshop). What follows is my attempt at an introduction, in great part written for the sake of clarifying my own understanding. I am indebted to Urmila for multiple conversations in which she indefatigably answered my questions and cleared my confusions — of course, any remaining inaccuracies in this post are entirely mine.</p>
<p><b>The result </b></p>
<p><a name="the-result"></a></p>
<p>Let’s start by recalling Mahadev’s result. She shows that from any quantum computation, specified by a polynomial-size quantum circuit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C}" class="latex" title="{C}" />, it is possible to efficiently compute a <em>classical-verifier quantum-prover protocol</em>, i.e.~a prescription for the actions of a classical probabilistic polynomial-time verifier interacting with a quantum prover, that has the following properties. For simplicity, assume that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C}" class="latex" title="{C}" /> produces a deterministic outcome <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bo%28C%29%5Cin%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{o(C)\in\{0,1\}}" class="latex" title="{o(C)\in\{0,1\}}" /> when it is executed on qubits initialized in the state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+0+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| 0 \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| 0 \rangle}" /> (any input can be hard-coded in the circuit). At the end of the protocol, the verifier always makes one of three possible decisions: “reject”; “accept, 0”; “accept, 1”. The <em>completeness</em> property states that for any circuit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C}" class="latex" title="{C}" /> there is a “honest” behavior for the prover that can be implemented by a polynomial-time quantum device and that will result in the verifier making the decision “accept, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bo%28C%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{o(C)}" class="latex" title="{o(C)}" />”, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bo%28C%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{o(C)}" class="latex" title="{o(C)}" /> is the correct outcome, with probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />. The <em>soundness</em> property states that for any behavior of the quantum prover in the protocol, either the probability that the verifier returns the outcome “accept, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1-o%28C%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1-o(C)}" class="latex" title="{1-o(C)}" />” is negligibly small, or the quantum prover has the ability to break a post-quantum cryptographic scheme with non-negligible advantage. Specifically, the proof of the soundness property demonstrates that a prover that manages to mislead the verifier into making the wrong decision (for any circuit) can be turned into an efficient attack on the learning with errors (LWE) problem (with superpolynomial noise ratio).</p>
<p>The fact that the protocol is only sound against computationally bounded provers sets it apart from previous approaches, which increased the power of the verifier by allowing her to dispose of a miniature quantum computer, but established soundness against computationally unbounded provers. The magic of Mahadev’s result is that she manages to leverage this sole assumption, computational boundnedness of the prover, to tie a very tight “leash” around its neck, by purely classical means. My use of the word “leash” is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0448">not innocent</a>: informally, it seems that the cryptographic assumption allows Mahadev to achieve the kind of feats that were previously known, for classical verifiers, in the model where there are two quantum provers sharing entanglement. I am not sure how far the analogy extends, and would like to explore it further; this has already started with a collaboration with Brakerski, Christiano, Mahadev and Vazirani that led to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00640">a single-prover protocol for certifiable randomness expansion</a>. Nevertheless, the main open question left open by Mahadev’s work remains whether the computational assumption is even necessary: could a similar result hold, where the honest prover can perform the required actions in quantum polynomial-time, but the protocol remains sound against arbitrarily powerful provers? (Experts will have recognized that the existence of a protocol where the honest prover is as powerful as PSPACE follows from the classical results that BQP is in PSPACE, and that PSPACE=IP. Unfortunately, we currently don’t expect even a supercharged AWS cloud to be able to implement PSPACE-complete computations.)</p>
<p><b> Encoding computation in ground states </b></p>
<p><a name="encoding-computation-in-ground-states"></a></p>
<p>Let’s get to business: how does this work? Fix a quantum circuit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C}" class="latex" title="{C}" /> that the verifier is interested in. Assume the description of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C}" class="latex" title="{C}" /> known to both the verifier and the prover. As earlier, assume further that when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C}" class="latex" title="{C}" /> is executed on a state initialized to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+0+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| 0 \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| 0 \rangle}" /> a measurement of the output qubit of the circuit returns either the outcome <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0}" class="latex" title="{0}" /> or the outcome <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />, deterministically. The verifier wishes to determine which case holds.</p>
<p>The first step that the verifier performs is a classical polynomial-time reduction from this <em>circuit output decision problem</em> to the following <em>Hamiltonian energy decision problem</em>. In the Hamiltonian energy decision problem the input is the description of a pair of classical polynomial-time randomized circuits. The first circuit, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" />, takes as input a random string <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" />, and returns a string <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctheta%5Cin%5C%7BX%2CZ%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\theta\in\{X,Z\}^n}" class="latex" title="{\theta\in\{X,Z\}^n}" />. The second circuit, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{V}" class="latex" title="{V}" />, takes as input a string <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctheta%5Cin%5C%7BX%2CZ%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\theta\in\{X,Z\}^n}" class="latex" title="{\theta\in\{X,Z\}^n}" /> of the kind returned by the first circuit, as well as an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />-bit string <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%5Cin%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a\in\{0,1\}^n}" class="latex" title="{a\in\{0,1\}^n}" />, and returns a “decision bit” <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%5Cin+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b\in \{0,1\}}" class="latex" title="{b\in \{0,1\}}" />. The goal of the verifier is to distinguish between the following two cases. Either there exists an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />-qubit state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\rho}" class="latex" title="{\rho}" /> such that, when a string <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctheta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\theta}" class="latex" title="{\theta}" /> is sampled according to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" /> (choosing a uniformly random <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" /> as input), the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> qubits of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\rho}" class="latex" title="{\rho}" /> are measured in the bases specified by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctheta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\theta}" class="latex" title="{\theta}" /> (i.e.~the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{i}" class="latex" title="{i}" />-th qubit is measured in the computational basis in case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctheta_i%3DZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\theta_i=Z}" class="latex" title="{\theta_i=Z}" />, and in the Hadamard basis in case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctheta_i%3DX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\theta_i=X}" class="latex" title="{\theta_i=X}" />), the resulting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />-bit outcome <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a}" class="latex" title="{a}" /> satisfies <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%28%5Ctheta%2Ca%29%3D1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{V(\theta,a)=1}" class="latex" title="{V(\theta,a)=1}" /> with probability at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%2F4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{3/4}" class="latex" title="{3/4}" />. Or, for any state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\rho}" class="latex" title="{\rho}" />, the same procedure results in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%28%5Ctheta%2Ca%29%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{V(\theta,a)=0}" class="latex" title="{V(\theta,a)=0}" /> with probability at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%2F3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2/3}" class="latex" title="{2/3}" />.</p>
<p>I called this problem the Hamiltonian energy decision problem because the circuits <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{V}" class="latex" title="{V}" /> implicitly specify a Hamiltonian, whose minimal energy the verifier aims to approximate. Note that the Hamiltonian is not required to be local, and furthermore it may involve an average of exponentially many terms (as many as there are random strings <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" />). The problem is still in QMA, because the verifier is efficient. It is not hard to show that the problem is QMA-hard. What the formulation above buys us, compared to using the usual QMA-complete formulation of the local Hamiltonian problem, is the constant energy gap — which comes at the cost of exponentially many terms and loss of locality. (Open question: I would like to know if it is possible to achieve a constant gap with only one of these caveats: local with exponentially many terms, or nonlocal with polynomially terms.) Of course here we only care that the problem is BQP-hard, and that the witness can be computed by a BQP prover; this is indeed the case. We also don’t really care that there is a constant gap – the soundness of the final protocol could be amplified by other means – but it is convenient that we are able to assume it.</p>
<p>The reduction that achieves this is a combination of Kitaev’s history state construction with some gadgetry from perturbation theory and an amplification trick. The first step reduces the verification that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C}" class="latex" title="{C}" /> returns outcome <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" /> (resp. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0}" class="latex" title="{0}" />) on input <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+0+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| 0 \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| 0 \rangle}" /> to the verification that a local Hamiltonian <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{H}" class="latex" title="{H}" /> (computed from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C}" class="latex" title="{C}" />) has ground state energy exponentially close to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0}" class="latex" title="{0}" /> (resp. at least some positive inverse polynomial). The second step consists in applying perturbation theory to reduce to the case where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{H}" class="latex" title="{H}" /> is a weighted linear combination of terms of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX_iX_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X_iX_j}" class="latex" title="{X_iX_j}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ_iZ_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z_iZ_j}" class="latex" title="{Z_iZ_j}" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X_i}" class="latex" title="{X_i}" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z_j}" class="latex" title="{Z_j}" /> are the Pauli <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" /> operators on the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{i}" class="latex" title="{i}" />-th and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{j}" class="latex" title="{j}" />-th qubit respectively. The final step is an amplification trick, that produces a nonlocal Hamiltonian whose each term is a tensor product of single-qubit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" /> observables and has ground state energy either less than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1/4}" class="latex" title="{1/4}" /> or larger than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1/3}" class="latex" title="{1/3}" /> (when the Hamiltonian is scaled to be non-negative with norm at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />).</p>
<p>These steps are fairly standard. The first two are combined in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06046">paper</a> by Fitzsimons and Morimae to obtain a protocol for “post-hoc” verification of quantum computation: the prover prepares the ground state of an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BXZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{XZ}" class="latex" title="{XZ}" /> local Hamiltonian whose energy encodes the outcome of the computation, and sends it to the verifier one qubit at a time; the verifier only needs to perform single-qubit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" /> measurements to estimate the energy. The last step, amplification, is described in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03574">paper</a> with Natarajan, where we use it to obtain a multi-prover interactive proof system for QMA.</p>
<p>For the remainder of this post, I take the reduction for granted and focus on the core of Mahadev’s result, a verification protocol for the following problem: given a Hamiltonian of the form described in the previous paragraph, decide whether the ground state energy of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{H}" class="latex" title="{H}" /> is smaller than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1/4}" class="latex" title="{1/4}" />, or larger than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1/3}" class="latex" title="{1/3}" />.</p>

<p>In fact, for the sake of presentation I’ll make one further drastic simplification, which is that the verifier’s goal has been reduced to verifying the existence of a <em>single-qubit</em> state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\rho}" class="latex" title="{\rho}" />, whose existence is claimed by the prover. Specifically, suppose that the prover claims that it has the ability to prepare a state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+%5Cpsi+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| \psi \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| \psi \rangle}" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clangle+%5Cpsi+%7CX%7C+%5Cpsi+%5Crangle+%3D+E_X%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\langle \psi |X| \psi \rangle = E_X}" class="latex" title="{\langle \psi |X| \psi \rangle = E_X}" />, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clangle+%5Cpsi+%7CZ%7C+%5Cpsi+%5Crangle%3DE_Z%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\langle \psi |Z| \psi \rangle=E_Z}" class="latex" title="{\langle \psi |Z| \psi \rangle=E_Z}" />, for real parameters <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE_X%2CE_Z%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{E_X,E_Z}" class="latex" title="{E_X,E_Z}" />. In other words, that the Hamiltonian <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%28X%2BZ%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{H = \frac{1}{2}(X+Z)}" class="latex" title="{H = \frac{1}{2}(X+Z)}" /> has minimal energy at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%28E_X%2BE_Z%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\frac{1}{2}(E_X+E_Z)}" class="latex" title="{\frac{1}{2}(E_X+E_Z)}" />. How can one verify this claim? (Of course we could do it analytically\ldots{}but that approach would break apart as soon as expectation values on larger sets of qubits are considered.)</p>
<p>We could ask the prover to measure in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> basis, or the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" /> basis, repeatedly on identical copies of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+%5Cpsi+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| \psi \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| \psi \rangle}" />, and report the outcomes. But how do we know that all these measurements were performed on the same state, and that the prover didn’t choose e.g. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+%5Cpsi+%5Crangle%3D%7C+1+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| \psi \rangle=| 1 \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| \psi \rangle=| 1 \rangle}" /> to report the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" />-basis outcomes, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+%5Cpsi+%5Crangle%3D%7C+-+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| \psi \rangle=| - \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| \psi \rangle=| - \rangle}" /> to report the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" />-basis outcomes? We need to find a way to prevent the prover from measuring a different state depending on the basis it is asked for — as well as to ensure the measurement is performed in the right basis.</p>
<p><b> Committing to a qubit </b></p>
<p><a name="committing-to-a-qubit"></a></p>
<p>The key idea in Mahadev’s protocol is to use cryptographic techniques to force the prover to “commit” to the state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+%5Cpsi+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| \psi \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| \psi \rangle}" /> in a way that, once the commitment has been performed, the prover no longer has the liberty to “decide” which measurement it performs on the commited qubit (unless it breaks the cryptographic assumption).</p>
<p>I described the commitment scheme in the companion post <a href="https://quantumfrontiers.com/2018/08/05/the-quantum-wave-in-computing/">here</a>. For convenience, let me quote from that post. Recall that the scheme is based on a pair of trapdoor permutations <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_0%2Cf_1%3A%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%5Crightarrow+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_0,f_1:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n}" class="latex" title="{f_0,f_1:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n}" /> that is <em>claw-free</em>. Informally, this means that it is hard to produce any pair <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28x_0%2Cx_1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(x_0,x_1)}" class="latex" title="{(x_0,x_1)}" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_0%28x_0%29%3Df_1%28x_1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_0(x_0)=f_1(x_1)}" class="latex" title="{f_0(x_0)=f_1(x_1)}" />.</p>
<p>The commitment phase of the protocol works as follows. Starting from a state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+%5Cpsi+%5Crangle%3D%5Calpha%7C+0+%5Crangle%2B%5Cbeta%7C+1+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| \psi \rangle=\alpha| 0 \rangle+\beta| 1 \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| \psi \rangle=\alpha| 0 \rangle+\beta| 1 \rangle}" /> of its choice, the prover is supposed to perform the following steps. First, the prover creates a uniform superposition over the common domain of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_0}" class="latex" title="{f_0}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_1}" class="latex" title="{f_1}" />. Then it evaluates either function, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_0}" class="latex" title="{f_0}" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_1}" class="latex" title="{f_1}" />, in an additional register, by controlling on the qubit of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+%5Cpsi+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| \psi \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| \psi \rangle}" />. Finally, the prover measures the register that contains the image of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_0}" class="latex" title="{f_0}" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_1}" class="latex" title="{f_1}" />. This achieves the following sequence of transformations:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Brcl%7D+%5Calpha%7C+0+%5Crangle%2B%5Cbeta%7C+1+%5Crangle+%26%5Cmapsto%26+%28%5Calpha%7C+0+%5Crangle+%2B+%5Cbeta%7C+1+%5Crangle%29+%5Cotimes+%5CBig%282%5E%7B-n%2F2%7D+%5Csum_%7Bx%5Cin%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En%7D+%7C+x+%5Crangle%5CBig%29+%5C%5C+%26%5Cmapsto+%26+2%5E%7B-n%2F2%7D+%5Csum_x+%5Calpha+%7C+0+%5Crangle%7C+x+%5Crangle%7C+f_0%28x%29+%5Crangle+%2B+%5Cbeta+%7C+1+%5Crangle%7C+f_1%28x%29+%5Crangle%5C%5C+%26%5Cmapsto+%26+%5Cbig%28%5Calpha%7C+0+%5Crangle%7C+x_0+%5Crangle%2B%5Cbeta%7C+1+%5Crangle%7C+x_1+%5Crangle%5Cbig%29%7C+y+%5Crangle%5C%3B%2C+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle \begin{array}{rcl} \alpha| 0 \rangle+\beta| 1 \rangle &amp;\mapsto&amp; (\alpha| 0 \rangle + \beta| 1 \rangle) \otimes \Big(2^{-n/2} \sum_{x\in\{0,1\}^n} | x \rangle\Big) \\ &amp;\mapsto &amp; 2^{-n/2} \sum_x \alpha | 0 \rangle| x \rangle| f_0(x) \rangle + \beta | 1 \rangle| f_1(x) \rangle\\ &amp;\mapsto &amp; \big(\alpha| 0 \rangle| x_0 \rangle+\beta| 1 \rangle| x_1 \rangle\big)| y \rangle\;, \end{array} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle \begin{array}{rcl} \alpha| 0 \rangle+\beta| 1 \rangle &amp;\mapsto&amp; (\alpha| 0 \rangle + \beta| 1 \rangle) \otimes \Big(2^{-n/2} \sum_{x\in\{0,1\}^n} | x \rangle\Big) \\ &amp;\mapsto &amp; 2^{-n/2} \sum_x \alpha | 0 \rangle| x \rangle| f_0(x) \rangle + \beta | 1 \rangle| f_1(x) \rangle\\ &amp;\mapsto &amp; \big(\alpha| 0 \rangle| x_0 \rangle+\beta| 1 \rangle| x_1 \rangle\big)| y \rangle\;, \end{array} " /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%5Cin%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y\in\{0,1\}^n}" class="latex" title="{y\in\{0,1\}^n}" /> is the measured image. The string <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> is the prover’s <em>commitment string</em>, that it reports the verifier.</p>
<p>The intuition for this commitment procedure is that it introduces asymmetry between prover and verifier: the prover knows <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> (it had to report it to the verifier) but not <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_0}" class="latex" title="{x_0}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_1}" class="latex" title="{x_1}" /> (this is the claw-free assumption on the pair <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28f_0%2Cf_1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(f_0,f_1)}" class="latex" title="{(f_0,f_1)}" />), which seems to prevent it from recovering the original state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+%5Cpsi+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| \psi \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| \psi \rangle}" />, since it does not have the ability to “uncompute” <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_0}" class="latex" title="{x_0}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_1}" class="latex" title="{x_1}" />. In contrast, the verifier can use the trapdoor information to recover both preimages.</p>
<p>In a little more detail, how is this used? Note that at this point, from the verifier’s point of view the only information that has been received is the prover’s commitment string <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />. In general there are multiple ways a prover could have come up with a value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />: for example, by selecting an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Cin%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x\in\{0,1\}^n}" class="latex" title="{x\in\{0,1\}^n}" /> and returning <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%3Df_0%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y=f_0(x)}" class="latex" title="{y=f_0(x)}" />. Or, by directly selecting an arbitrary string <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%5Cin%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y\in\{0,1\}^n}" class="latex" title="{y\in\{0,1\}^n}" />. At this stage of the protocol, any of these strategies look fine.</p>
<p>Let’s modify the commitment phase by adding a little test. With some probability, the verifier, upon receiving the commitment string <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />, decides to challenge the prover by asking it to report a valid preimage of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />, either under <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_0}" class="latex" title="{f_0}" /> or under <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_1}" class="latex" title="{f_1}" /> (to the prover’s choice). Since both <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_0}" class="latex" title="{f_0}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_1}" class="latex" title="{f_1}" /> are presumed to be hard to invert, the only way the prover can answer this challenge is if it already “knows” a valid preimage — or at a minimum, if it has a superposition on preimages that it can measure when tested. Thus the fact that the prover is required to succeed in the commitment test, when it is performed, guarantees that after the prover has returned the commitment string <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> we may without loss of generality assume that the prover’s state can be written as</p>
<p><a name="eqdef-psi"></a></p>
<p align="center"><a name="eqdef-psi"></a><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%7C+%5Ctilde%7B%5Cpsi%7D+%5Crangle%3D%5Ctilde%7B%5Calpha%7D%7C+0%2Cx_0+%5Crangle%7C+%5Cphi_0+%5Crangle%2B%5Ctilde%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7C+1%2Cx_1+%5Crangle%7C+%5Cphi_1+%5Crangle%5C%3B%2C+%5C+%5C+%5C+%5C+%5C+%281%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle | \tilde{\psi} \rangle=\tilde{\alpha}| 0,x_0 \rangle| \phi_0 \rangle+\tilde{\beta}| 1,x_1 \rangle| \phi_1 \rangle\;, \ \ \ \ \ (1)" class="latex" title="\displaystyle | \tilde{\psi} \rangle=\tilde{\alpha}| 0,x_0 \rangle| \phi_0 \rangle+\tilde{\beta}| 1,x_1 \rangle| \phi_1 \rangle\;, \ \ \ \ \ (1)" /></p>
<p><a name="eqdef-psi"></a></p>
<p>where we have purposefully spelled out the two possible preimages that the prover could return if challenged. Note that aside from the fact that it gives the ability to obtain <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_0}" class="latex" title="{x_0}" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_1}" class="latex" title="{x_1}" />, this format does not make any assumption on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+%5Ctilde%7B%5Cpsi%7D+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" />; in particular the register containing the preimage can be entangled with other private registers of the prover.</p>
<p>We have defined a four-message commitment protocol: the verifier sends the security parameters to prover; the prover sends a commitment string <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> back; an optional one-round preimage test is executed. Now is the time to give a first definition for the single qubit to which the prover has “committed” by returning <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />. This <em>committed qubit</em> is the state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma}" class="latex" title="{\sigma}" /> that we ultimately aim to show has the claimed expectation values under <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" /> measurements.</p>
<p>Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma}" class="latex" title="{\sigma}" /> be the qubit obtained from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+%5Ctilde%7B%5Cpsi%7D+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" /> by erasing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_0}" class="latex" title="{x_0}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_1}" class="latex" title="{x_1}" /> (which is possible given knowledge of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />) and returning the first qubit of the resulting state. (Later we will slightly modify this definition, but it is a good placeholder to get us started.) Note that the verifier does not know the state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma}" class="latex" title="{\sigma}" />; in fact, strictly speaking <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma}" class="latex" title="{\sigma}" /> is not present on the prover’s workspace either. The point is that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma}" class="latex" title="{\sigma}" /> exists, and this is all we need. Our remaining task is to find a way for the verifier to extract from the prover measurement outcomes that are distributed as would be a measurement of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma}" class="latex" title="{\sigma}" /> in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" /> basis, without the prover having the ability to deviate. If the verifier can do this, for a basis of her choice, she can choose a basis at random, estimate the expectation value, and check the prover’s claim (the values <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE_X%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{E_X}" class="latex" title="{E_X}" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE_Z%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{E_Z}" class="latex" title="{E_Z}" />).</p>
<p>As already mentioned, the key point that we’ll use in order to achieve this is that at the end of the commitment phase, the verifier has obtained some leverage over the prover: given <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> and the trapdoor information, the verifier can recover both <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_0}" class="latex" title="{x_0}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_1}" class="latex" title="{x_1}" />. In contrast, the prover, while it holds the state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+%5Ctilde%7B%5Cpsi%7D+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" />, is not able to freely operate on it. Without the trapdoor, it can no longer uncompute <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_0}" class="latex" title="{x_0}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_1}" class="latex" title="{x_1}" /> to recover the initial state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+%5Cpsi+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| \psi \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| \psi \rangle}" />, and so it can’t obviously apply, say, the unitary on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+%5Ctilde%7B%5Cpsi%7D+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" /> that would amount to performing a single-qubit rotation on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+%5Cpsi+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| \psi \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| \psi \rangle}" />.</p>
<p><b> Measuring in the computational basis </b></p>
<p><a name="measuring-in-the-computational-basis"></a></p>
<p>We need to explain how the verifier extracts measurement outcomes in the X (Hadamard) or Z (computational) basis from the prover. For each basis there is a small sub-protocol. At the end of the sub-protocol the verifier records a single bit, that it considers is the outcome obtained by a measurement of the committed qubit, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma}" class="latex" title="{\sigma}" />, in the corresponding basis. We call this bit the verifier’s “decoded bit” for that basis.</p>
<p>The protocol for extracting the outcome of a measurement in the computational basis is straightforward. Recall that by definition the prover’s state after the commitment phase has ended is the state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+%5Ctilde%7B%5Cpsi%7D+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" /> in <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/Users/Thomas/Dropbox/www/myCQstate/verification2-clean.html#eqdef-psi">(1)</a>. Moreover, recall that we made a choice of basis for the provers’ space such that when the prover is challenged for a preimage of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />, it measures the first <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28n%2B1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(n+1)}" class="latex" title="{(n+1)}" /> qubits of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+%5Ctilde%7B%5Cpsi%7D+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" /> in the computational basis and returns the outcome. Now observe that the first bit of this outcome is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0}" class="latex" title="{0}" /> with probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%5Ctilde%7B%5Calpha%7D%7C%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{|\tilde{\alpha}|^2}" class="latex" title="{|\tilde{\alpha}|^2}" />, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" /> with probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%5Ctilde%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7C%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{|\tilde{\beta}|^2}" class="latex" title="{|\tilde{\beta}|^2}" />. This is exactly the distribution of the outcome of a measurement of the committed qubit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma}" class="latex" title="{\sigma}" /> in the computational basis, by definition! Thus to extract a measurement outcome in the computational basis the verifier simply executes the preimage test and records the first bit returned by the prover as the decoded bit.</p>
<p><b> Measuring in the Hadamard basis </b></p>
<p><a name="measuring-in-the-hadamard-basis"></a></p>
<p>Extracting a measurement outcome in the Hadamard basis is more delicate. Recall the form of the prover’s state in <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/Users/Thomas/Dropbox/www/myCQstate/verification2-clean.html#eqdef-psi">(1)</a>. Given our definition of the committed qubit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma}" class="latex" title="{\sigma}" />, the natural way to obtain a measurement of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma}" class="latex" title="{\sigma}" /> in the Hadamard basis, starting from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+%5Ctilde%7B%5Cpsi%7D+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" />, is to first erase the register containing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_0}" class="latex" title="{x_0}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_1}" class="latex" title="{x_1}" />, and then perform a Hadamard measurement of the first qubit. But even an honest prover cannot accomplish this, as it does not have the trapdoor information that would allow to erase <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_0}" class="latex" title="{x_0}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_1}" class="latex" title="{x_1}" /> (of course we purposefully set things up this way). What the prover <em>can</em> do, however, is measure all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> qubits of the register containing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_0}" class="latex" title="{x_0}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_1}" class="latex" title="{x_1}" /> in the Hadamard basis. The result of this measurement is an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />-bit string <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%5Cin%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d\in\{0,1\}^n}" class="latex" title="{d\in\{0,1\}^n}" />. The corresponding post-measurement state is, up to global phase,</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Ctilde%7B%5Calpha%7D%7C+0+%5Crangle%7C+%5Cphi_0+%5Crangle%2B%28-1%29%5E%7Bd%5Ccdot%28x_0%2B+x_1%29%7D%5Ctilde%7B%5Cbeta%7D%7C+1+%5Crangle%7C+%5Cphi_1+%5Crangle%5C%3B%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle \tilde{\alpha}| 0 \rangle| \phi_0 \rangle+(-1)^{d\cdot(x_0+ x_1)}\tilde{\beta}| 1 \rangle| \phi_1 \rangle\;," class="latex" title="\displaystyle \tilde{\alpha}| 0 \rangle| \phi_0 \rangle+(-1)^{d\cdot(x_0+ x_1)}\tilde{\beta}| 1 \rangle| \phi_1 \rangle\;," /></p>
<p>where the addition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_0%2Bx_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_0+x_1}" class="latex" title="{x_0+x_1}" /> is taken bitwise, modulo <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" />. Observe that this state is almost exactly the committed qubit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma}" class="latex" title="{\sigma}" /> — except for a phase flip, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%5E%7Bd%5Ccdot%28x_0%5Coplus+x_1%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z^{d\cdot(x_0\oplus x_1)}}" class="latex" title="{Z^{d\cdot(x_0\oplus x_1)}}" />, applied on the first qubit. If the prover measures the remaining qubit in the Hadamard basis, the phase flip leads to a bit flip on the outcome <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m}" class="latex" title="{m}" /> of the measurement. So the verifier can ask the prover to report both <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m}" class="latex" title="{m}" />; if she recourds the decoded bit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%3Dm%5Coplus+d%5Ccdot+%28x_0%5Coplus+x_1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b=m\oplus d\cdot (x_0\oplus x_1)}" class="latex" title="{b=m\oplus d\cdot (x_0\oplus x_1)}" /> then this bit matches the outcome of a measurement of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma}" class="latex" title="{\sigma}" /> in the Hadamard basis.</p>
<p>This completes the description of the measurement sub-protocol for the Hadamard basis. It is clear that a honest prover, performing the actions described above, will induce the verifier into recording the correct outcome. Now of course in general the prover may act in an arbitrary way! It could report any values for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28m%2Cd%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(m,d)}" class="latex" title="{(m,d)}" />: the verifier accepts any outcomes on faith. How could this possibly work out? There is magic in Mahadev’s proof.</p>
<p><b> Malicious provers </b></p>
<p><a name="malicious-provers"></a></p>
<p>Let’s assume, as we already have, that the prover is arbitrary but that, if tested in the commitment phase, it succeeds with certainty. According to the discussion around <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/Users/Thomas/Dropbox/www/myCQstate/verification2-clean.html#eqdef-psi">(1)</a> this implies that at the end of the commitment phase the prover holds a state of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+%5Ctilde%7B%5Cpsi%7D+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" />. Moreover, by definition, when asked for a computational basis measurement the prover measures the first <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28n%2B1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(n+1)}" class="latex" title="{(n+1)}" /> qubits of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+%5Ctilde%7B%5Cpsi%7D+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" /> in the computational basis and reports the outcome; the verifier records the first bit as its decoded bit.</p>
<p>As we already argued, our earlier definition of the committed qubit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma}" class="latex" title="{\sigma}" /> ensures that the verifier’s decoded bit for the case of a computational basis measurement matches the outcome of a measurement of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma}" class="latex" title="{\sigma}" /> in the computational basis. Unfortunately for the case of a Hadamard basis measurement we are in trouble. Since the prover may in principle report an arbitrary pair <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28m%2Cd%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(m,d)}" class="latex" title="{(m,d)}" /> there is no chance to argue that this matches (in distribution) the outcome of a measurement of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma}" class="latex" title="{\sigma}" /> in the Hadamard basis. To find a state that is consistent with the verifier’s decoded bit in both bases we need to change our definition of the committed qubit to take into account the prover’s action in the case it is asked for a Hadamard measurement.</p>
<p>Recall that the main leverage that the verifier has over the prover is that, while the prover does have the possibility of reporting arbitrary outcomes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28m%2Cd%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(m,d)}" class="latex" title="{(m,d)}" />, it <em>does not</em> have control over the verifier’s decoding, i.e.~the operation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%5Cleftarrow+m%5Coplus+%28d%5Ccdot%28x_0%2B+x_1%29%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b\leftarrow m\oplus (d\cdot(x_0+ x_1))}" class="latex" title="{b\leftarrow m\oplus (d\cdot(x_0+ x_1))}" />. Let’s work a little bit and spell out the distribution of the verifier’s Hadamard basis decoded bit, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b}" class="latex" title="{b}" />. Towards this it is convenient to think of the prover in the following way: the prover first applies an arbitrary unitary “attack” <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{U}" class="latex" title="{U}" /> on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+%5Ctilde%7B%5Cpsi%7D+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" />, then “honestly” measures the first <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28n%2B1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(n+1)}" class="latex" title="{(n+1)}" /> qubits in the Hadamard basis, and finally reports the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28n%2B1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(n+1)}" class="latex" title="{(n+1)}" />-bit outcome <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28m%2Cd%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(m,d)}" class="latex" title="{(m,d)}" />. An arbitrary <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28n%2B1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(n+1)}" class="latex" title="{(n+1)}" />-bit-outcome measurement can always be expressed in this way. With this setup we can write the probability that the decoded bit is some value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%5Cin%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b\in\{0,1\}}" class="latex" title="{b\in\{0,1\}}" /> as</p>

<p><a name="eqprb-1"></a></p>
<p>Before we can proceed we should say a little more about the computational assumptions that are placed on the pair of functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28f_0%2Cf_1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(f_0,f_1)}" class="latex" title="{(f_0,f_1)}" />. Earlier we mentioned this pair of functions should be claw-free, but in fact a little more is needed — though all requirements can ultimately be met by a construction based on the Learning With Errors problem. Rather than state the exact assumptions, I will mention two important consequences. The first is that the pair of functions is “collapsing”, a notion introduced by Unruh in his investigations of <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-49896-5_18">collision-resistance against quantum attacks</a>. In our context this property implies that it is computationally hard to distinguish between an arbitrary superposition over preimages, as in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+%5Ctilde%7B%5Cpsi%7D+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" />, and the “collapsed” state obtained by measuring the control register (the first qubit). The second is that for any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />-bit string <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" /> that can be obtained as the outcome of an arbitrary, but computationally efficient, measurement on the collapsed state, the bit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%5Ccdot%28x_0%2Bx_1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d\cdot(x_0+x_1)}" class="latex" title="{d\cdot(x_0+x_1)}" /> is computationally indistinguishable from uniform. (This is analogous to a “hardcore bit” property, since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_0%2Bx_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_0+x_1}" class="latex" title="{x_0+x_1}" /> encodes information about both preimages simultaneously, and such information should not be accessible if the pair <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28f_0%2Cf_1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(f_0,f_1)}" class="latex" title="{(f_0,f_1)}" /> is claw-free.)</p>
<p>These two assumptions taken together justify the following two modifications to the expression for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPr%28b%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\Pr(b)}" class="latex" title="{\Pr(b)}" /> in <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/Users/Thomas/Dropbox/www/myCQstate/verification2-clean.html#eqprb-1">(2)</a>, that will lead to a computationally indistinguishable distribution. First, we can “collapse” the first <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28n%2B1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(n+1)}" class="latex" title="{(n+1)}" /> qubits of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C+%5Ctilde%7B%5Cpsi%7D+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" class="latex" title="{| \tilde{\psi} \rangle}" /> by measuring them in the computational basis. Second, we can replace the bit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%5Ccdot%28x_0%2Bx_1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d\cdot(x_0+x_1)}" class="latex" title="{d\cdot(x_0+x_1)}" /> by a uniformly random bit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" />. Using that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csum_d+%7C+d+%5Crangle%5C%21%5Clangle+d+%7C%3D%5Censuremath%7B%5Cmathop%7B%5Crm+Id%7D%5Cnolimits%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sum_d | d \rangle\!\langle d |=\ensuremath{\mathop{\rm Id}\nolimits}}" class="latex" title="{\sum_d | d \rangle\!\langle d |=\ensuremath{\mathop{\rm Id}\nolimits}}" />, the expression simplifies to</p>

<p>where the outermost <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%5Er%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z^r}" class="latex" title="{Z^r}" /> were inserted thanks to the first assumption (the collapsing property), and the innermost <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%5Er%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z^r}" class="latex" title="{Z^r}" /> come from commuting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%5Er%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X^r}" class="latex" title="{X^r}" /> past the Hadamard. I should clarify that obtaining <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/Users/Thomas/Dropbox/www/myCQstate/verification2-clean.html#eqprb-3">(3)</a> formally requires more care. In particular, I made use of computational indistinguishability in an expression that involves a quantity that is hard to compute (the parity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_0%2Bx_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_0+x_1}" class="latex" title="{x_0+x_1}" />). This is illegal, and to work around the difficulty Mahadev has to introduce some additional ingenious manipulations that I am skipping here.</p>
<p>Note the key effect that the random <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%5Er%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z^r}" class="latex" title="{Z^r}" /> operator has in <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/Users/Thomas/Dropbox/www/myCQstate/verification2-clean.html#eqprb-3">(3)</a>: it effectively trivializes the action of the prover’s “attack” <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{U}" class="latex" title="{U}" /> on the first qubit <em>with respect to the computational basis</em>. Thus the result of this argument is that we have managed to argue that the verifier’s decoded bit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b}" class="latex" title="{b}" /> associated with the Hadamard basis is <em>computationally indistinguishable</em> from the outcome of a Hadamard measurement on the state</p>

<p>where we expanded the first qubit of the unitary <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{U}" class="latex" title="{U}" /> as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU+%3D+I%5Cotimes+U_I+%2B+X+%5Cotimes+U_X+%2B+Z%5Cotimes+U_Z+%2B+XZ+%5Cotimes+U_%7BXZ%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{U = I\otimes U_I + X \otimes U_X + Z\otimes U_Z + XZ \otimes U_{XZ}}" class="latex" title="{U = I\otimes U_I + X \otimes U_X + Z\otimes U_Z + XZ \otimes U_{XZ}}" />, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{E}" class="latex" title="{E}" /> represents all registers except the first qubit. Note that the second term involves an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> on the first qubit, which has no effect on a measurement in the Hadamard basis. Thus, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma'}" class="latex" title="{\sigma'}" /> can be updated to a state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%27%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma''}" class="latex" title="{\sigma''}" /> where we have “erased” the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> operator on the first qubit. Moreover, by definition, a measurement of the first (and only) qubit of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%27%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma''}" class="latex" title="{\sigma''}" /> in the computational basis yields an outcome distributed exactly as it would on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma}" class="latex" title="{\sigma}" />. In particular, it is consistent with the verifier’s decoded bit in the computational basis measurement protocol.</p>
<p>We are done! The state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma'}" class="latex" title="{\sigma'}" /> is a well-defined single-qubit state such that the distribution of decoded bits recorded by the verifier for either basis is computationally indistinguishable from the distribution of outcomes of a measurement of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma'}" class="latex" title="{\sigma'}" /> in the same basis. Note that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma'}" class="latex" title="{\sigma'}" /> may not “exist” at any point of the protocol. But this is besides the point: as long as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma'}" class="latex" title="{\sigma'}" /> is a well-defined quantum state, and the verifier correctly records decoded measurement outcomes, this eventually leads to a valid certificate for the prover’s claim that the XZ Hamiltonian that encodes the computation has low enough energy.</p>
<p>Phew. Catch your breath, read this post again (and please do ask for clarifications as needed), and then move on to the beautiful <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01082">paper</a>, whose introduction already has more depth than I could provide here, and whose body fills in all the remaining gaps. (This includes how to deal with states that are more than a single qubit, an issue that my presentation of the single-qubit case may make seem more thorny than it is — in fact, it is possible to express the argument given here in a way that makes it relatively straightforward to extend to multiple qubits, though there are some technical issues, explained in Mahadev’s paper.) And then – use the idea to prove something!</p></div>

<p>I arrived at the Institute for Advanced Study to attend a workshop on <a href="https://www.math.ias.edu/ocit2018/agenda">Optimization, Complexity and Invariant Theory</a> organized by Avi Wigderson. The workshop has an incredibly diverse agenda, also reflected in the participants.</p>
<p>I will talk about <em>Geodesic Convexity: </em>Sometimes, functions that are non-convex in the Euclidean space turn out to be convex if one introduces a suitable metric (or differential structure) and redefines convexity with respect to the induced straight lines — <em>geodesics</em>. Such a function is called <em>geodesically convex. </em>Unlike standard convexity,<em>  w</em>hen does a function have this property and how to optimize it, is not well-understood. My talk will focus on introducing geodesic convexity and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04051">show</a> that the problem of computing the Brascamp-Lieb constant has a succinct geodesically convex formulation.</p>
<p>And, accompanying my talk are <a href="https://nisheethvishnoi.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/geodesicconvexity.pdf" title="GeodesicConvexity">these</a> self-contained and expository notes on differentiation on manifolds, geodesics, and geodesic convexity that are prepared with the help of my student Ozan Yildiz.</p></div>

<p>The picture to the right depicts Rudolf Kalman, a pioneer of modern control, receiving the presidential medal of freedom from president Barack Obama.<img src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/download.jpeg?w=1100" alt="download.jpeg" class=" size-full wp-image-181 alignright" /></p>
<p>The setting which Kalman considered, and has been a cornerstone of modern control, is that of stateful time-series. More precisely, consider a sequence of inputs and outputs, or measurements, coming from some real-world machine<br />
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2Cx_2%2C...%2Cx_T%2C...%C2%A0+%C2%A0%5C+%5C+%5CRightarrow%C2%A0+%5C+%5C+%5C+y_1%2Cy_2%2C+y_3+%2C+...%2C+y_T+%2C+...+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x_1,x_2,...,x_T,...   \ \ \Rightarrow  \ \ \ y_1,y_2, y_3 , ..., y_T , ... " class="latex" title="x_1,x_2,...,x_T,...   \ \ \Rightarrow  \ \ \ y_1,y_2, y_3 , ..., y_T , ... " /><br />
Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="y_t" class="latex" title="y_t" /> are measurements of ocean temperature, in a study of global warming. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x_t" class="latex" title="x_t" /> are various environmental knowns, such as time of the year, water acidity, etc.</li>
<li>Language translation, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x_t" class="latex" title="x_t" /> are words in Hebrew, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="y_t" class="latex" title="y_t" /> is their English translation</li>
<li><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x_t" class="latex" title="x_t" /> are physical controls of a robot, i.e. force in various directions, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="y_t" class="latex" title="y_t" /> are the location to which it moves</li>
</ul>
<p>Such systems are generally called dynamical systems, and one of the simplest and most useful mathematical models to capture a subset of them is called  linear dynamical systems (LDS), in which the output is generated according to the following equations:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_%7Bt%2B1%7D%C2%A0+%3D+A+h_t%C2%A0%2B+B+x_t+%2B+%5Ceta_t+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="h_{t+1}  = A h_t + B x_t + \eta_t " class="latex" title="h_{t+1}  = A h_t + B x_t + \eta_t " /><br />
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bt%2B1%7D%C2%A0+%C2%A0%3D+C+h_t%C2%A0%2B+D+x_t%C2%A0%2B+%5Czeta_t+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="y_{t+1}   = C h_t + D x_t + \zeta_t " class="latex" title="y_{t+1}   = C h_t + D x_t + \zeta_t " /></p>
<p>Here <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="h_t" class="latex" title="h_t" /> is a hidden state, which can have very large or even infinite dimensionality, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%2CB%2CC%2CD&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="A,B,C,D" class="latex" title="A,B,C,D" /> are linear transformations and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ceta_t%2C%5Czeta_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\eta_t,\zeta_t" class="latex" title="\eta_t,\zeta_t" /> are noise vectors.</p>
<p>This setting is general enough to capture a variety of machine learning models previously considered in isolation, such as HMM (hidden Markov models), principle and independent component analysis, mixture of Gaussian clusters and many more, see this <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/papers/NC110201.pdf">survey by Roweis and Ghahramani</a>.</p>
<p>Alas – without any further assumptions the Kalman filtering model is non-convex and computationally hard, thus general polynomial time algorithms for efficient worst-case prediction were not known, till some exciting recent developments I’ll survey below.</p>
<p>If the linear transformations <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%2CB%2CC%2CD&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="A,B,C,D" class="latex" title="A,B,C,D" /> are known, then it is possible to efficiently predict <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="y_t" class="latex" title="y_t" /> given all previous inputs and outputs of the system using convex optimization. Indeed, this is what the Kalman filter famously achieves, and in an optimal way. Similarly, if there is no hidden state, the problem becomes trivially convex, and thus easily solvable (see recent blog posts and papers by the Recht group further analyzing this case).</p>
<p>However, if the system given by the transformations A,B,C,D is unknown, recovering them from observations is called “system identification”, a notoriously hard problem. Even for HMMs, which can be seen as a special case of LDS (see the <a href="http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/papers/lds.pdf">RG</a> survey), the identification problem is known to be <a href="http://www.math.ru.nl/~terwijn/publications/icgiFinal.pdf">NP-hard</a> without additional assumptions. (Aside: HMMs <b>are</b> identifiable with further distributional assumption, see the breakthrough paper of<a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~djhsu/papers/hmm.pdf"> Hsu, Kakade and Zhang</a>, which started the recent tensor revolution in theoretical ML).</p>
<p>In the face of NP-hardness, state-of-the-art reduces to a set of heuristics. Amongst them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>By far the most common is the use of EM, or expectation maximization, to alternately solve for the system and the hidden states. Since this is a heuristic for non-convex optimization, global optimality is not guaranteed, and indeed EM can settle on a local optimum, as shown <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00946">here</a>.</li>
<li>Gradient descent: this wonderful heuristic can be applied for the non-convex problem of finding both the system and hidden states simultaneously. In a striking recent result, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05191">Hardt and Ma</a> showed that under some generative assumptions, gradient descent converges to the global minimum.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<p>This is where we go back to the convex path: using the failsafe methodology of convex relaxation and regret minimization in games, in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00946">recent</a> set of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03981">results</a> our group has found assumption-free, efficient algorithms for predicting in general LDS, as well as some other control extensions. At the heart of these results is a new method of spectral filtering. This method requires some mathematical exposition, we’ll defer it to a future longer post. For the rest of this post, we’ll describe the autoregressive (a.k.a. regression) methodology for LDS, which similar to our result, is a worst-case and convex-relaxation based method.</p>
<p>To see how this works, consider the LDS equations above, and notice that for zero-mean noise, the expected output at time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="t+1" class="latex" title="t+1" /> is given by: (we take <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="D=0" class="latex" title="D=0" /> for simplicity)<br />

This has few parameters to learn, namely only three matrices A,B,C, but has a very visible non-convex component of raising A to high powers.</p>
<p>The obvious convex relaxation takes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_i+%3D+C+A%5Ei+B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="M_i = C A^i B" class="latex" title="M_i = C A^i B" /> as a set of matrices for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%3D1%2C...%2Ct&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i=1,...,t" class="latex" title="i=1,...,t" />. We now have a set of linear equalities of the form:</p>
<p>$latex   y_{t+1}  = \sum_{i=1}^t M_i x_{t-1}  $</p>
<p>which can be solved by your favorite convex linear-regression optimizer. The fallacy is also clear: we have parameters that scale as the number of observations, and thus cannot hope to generalize.</p>
<p>Luckily, many systems are well behaved in the following way. First, notice that the very definition of an LDS requires the spectral norm of A to be bounded by one, otherwise we have signal explosion – it’s magnitude grows indefinitely with time. It is thus not too unreasonable to assume a strict bound away from one, say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7CA%7C+%5Cleq+1-+%5Cdelta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="|A| \leq 1- \delta" class="latex" title="|A| \leq 1- \delta" />, for some small constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+%3E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\delta &gt;0" class="latex" title="\delta &gt;0" />. This allows us to bound the magnitude of the i’th matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="M_i" class="latex" title="M_i" />, that is supposed to represent <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C+A%5Ei+B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="C A^i B" class="latex" title="C A^i B" />, by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281-%5Cdelta%29%5Ei&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="(1-\delta)^i" class="latex" title="(1-\delta)^i" />.</p>
<p>With this assumption, we can then take only <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%3D+O%28%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cdelta%7D+%5Clog+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cepsilon%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="k = O(\frac{1}{\delta} \log \frac{1}{\epsilon})" class="latex" title="k = O(\frac{1}{\delta} \log \frac{1}{\epsilon})" /> matrices, and write<br />
$latex  y_{t+1} = \sum_{i=1}^k M_i x_{t-1} + O(\epsilon) $<br />
This folklore method, called an autoregressive model or simply learning LDS by regression, is very powerful despite its simplicity. It has the usual wonderful merits of online learning by convex relaxation: is worst-case (no generative assumptions), agnostic, and online. Caveats? we have a linear dependence on the eigengap of the system, which can be very large for many interesting systems.</p>
<p>However, it is possible to remove this gap completely, and learn arbitrarily ill-defined LDS without dependence on the condition number. This method is also online, agnostic, and worst case, and is based on a new tool: wave-filtering. In essence it applies the online regression method on a specially-designed fixed filter of the input. To see how these filters are designed, and their theoretical properties, check out our recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00946">papers</a>!</p>

<div style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">
<p>This post is a long-overdue sequel to parts I and II of previous posts on unsupervised learning.  The long time it took me to publish this one is not by chance – I am still ambivalent on the merit, or lack of, for the notion of a worst-case PAC/statistical learnability (or, god forbid, regret minimization) without supervision.</p>
<p>And yet,<br />
1. I owe a followup to the stubborn few readers of the blog who have made it thus far.<br />
2. The algorithms we’ll discuss are mathematically correct, and even if completely useless in practice, can serve as amusement to us, fans of regret minimization in convex games.<br />
3. I really want to get on to more exciting recent developments in control that have kept me busy at night…</p>
<p>So, here goes:</p>
<p>The idea is to define unsupervised learning as PAC learning in the usual sense, with a real-valued objective function, and specially-structured hypothesis classes.</p>
<ul>
<li>A hypothesis is a pair of functions, one from domain to range and the other vice versa, called encoder-decoder pair.</li>
<li>The real-valued loss is also composed of two parts, one of which is the reconstruction error of the encoding-decoding scheme, and the other proportional to encoding length.</li>
</ul>
<p>Et-voila, all notions of generalizability carry over from statistical learning theory together with dimensionality concepts such as Rademacher complexity.</p>
<p>More significantly – these worst-case definitions allow improper learning of NP-hard concepts. For the fully-precise definitions, see  the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01132">paper with Tengyu Ma</a>. The latter also gives a striking example of a very well-studied NP-hard problem, namely dictionary learning, showing it can be learned in polynomial time using convex relaxations.</p>
<p>Henceforth, I’ll give a much simpler example that perhaps illustrates the concepts in an easier way, one that arose in conversations with our post-docs <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rlivni/">Roi Livni</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~kothari/">Pravesh Kothari</a>.</p>
<p>This example is on learning the Mixture-Of-Gaussians (MOG) unsupervised learning model, one of the most well-studied problems in machine learning. In this setting, a given distribution over data is assumed to be from a mixture distribution over normal random variables, and the goal is to associate each data point with the corresponding Gaussian, as well as to identify these Gaussians.</p>
<p>The MOG model has long served as a tool for scientific discovery, see e.g. this <a href="http://blog.mrtz.org/2014/04/22/pearsons-polynomial.html">blog post by Moritz Hardt</a> and links therein. However, computationally it is not well behaved in terms of worst-case complexity. Even the simpler “k-means” model is known to be NP-hard.</p>
<p>Here is where things get interesting: using reconstruction error and compression as a metric, we can learn MOG by a seemingly different unsupervised learning method – Principle Component Analysis (PCA)! The latter admits very efficient linear-algebra-based algorithms.</p>
<p>More formally: let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Cin+R%5E%7Bm+%5Ctimes+d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="X \in R^{m \times d}" class="latex" title="X \in R^{m \times d}" /> be a data matrix sampled i.i.d from some arbitrary distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Csim+D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x \sim D" class="latex" title="x \sim D" />. Assume w.l.o.g. that all norms are at most one. Given a set of k centers of Gaussians, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu_1%2C...%2C%5Cmu_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\mu_1,...,\mu_k" class="latex" title="\mu_1,...,\mu_k" />, minimize reconstruction error given by<br />
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E_%7Bx+%5Csim+D%7D+%5B+%5Cmin_i+%5C%7C+%5Cmu_i+-+x+%5C%7C%5E2%C2%A0+%5D%C2%A0+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="E_{x \sim D} [ \min_i \| \mu_i - x \|^2  ]  " class="latex" title="E_{x \sim D} [ \min_i \| \mu_i - x \|^2  ]  " /><br />
A more general formulation, allowing several means to contribute to the reconstruction error, is<br />
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E_%7Bx+%5Csim+D%7D+%5B+%5Cmin_%7B+%5C%7C+%5Calpha_x%5C%7C_2+%5Cleq+1%C2%A0+%7D%C2%A0+%5C%7C+%5Csum_%7Bj%7D+%5Calpha_j%C2%A0+%5Cmu_j+-+x+%5C%7C%5E2%C2%A0+%5D%C2%A0+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="E_{x \sim D} [ \min_{ \| \alpha_x\|_2 \leq 1  }  \| \sum_{j} \alpha_j  \mu_j - x \|^2  ]  " class="latex" title="E_{x \sim D} [ \min_{ \| \alpha_x\|_2 \leq 1  }  \| \sum_{j} \alpha_j  \mu_j - x \|^2  ]  " /><br />
Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M+%5Cin+R%5E%7Bd+%5Ctimes+k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="M \in R^{d \times k}" class="latex" title="M \in R^{d \times k}" /> be the matrix of all $\mu$ vectors. Then we can write the optimization problem as<br />
$latex  \min_{M} E_{x \sim D} [ \min_{ \| \alpha_x\|_2 \leq 1  }  \|   x  – M \alpha_x \|^2  ]  $<br />
This corresponds to an <b>encoding by vector $\alpha$ rather than by a single coordinate</b>. We can write the closed form solution to $\alpha_x$ as:<br />
$latex  \arg \min_{\alpha_x }    \|   x  – M \alpha_x \|^2   = M^{-1} x $<br />
and the objective becomes<br />
$latex  \min_{\alpha_x }    \|   x  – M \alpha_x \|^2   = \| x – M M^{-1} x\|_\star^2 $<br />
for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7C+%5C%7C_%5Cstar&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\| \|_\star" class="latex" title="\| \|_\star" /> being the spectral norm.<br />
Thus, we’re left with the optimization problem of<br />
$latex  \min_{M} E_{x \sim D} [  \|   x  – M M^{\dagger} x \|_\star^2  ]  $<br />
which amounts to PCA.</p>
<p>We have just semi-formally seen how MOG can be learned by PCA!</p>
<p>A more general theorem applies also to MOG that are not spherical, some details appear in the paper with Tengyu, in the section on spectral auto-encoders.</p>
<p>The keen readers will notice we lost something in compression along the way: the encoding is now a k-dimensional vector as opposed to a 1-hot k-dimensional vector, and thus takes $k \log \frac{1}{\epsilon}$ bits to represent in binary, as opposed to $O(\log k)$. We leave it as an open question to come up with an <i>efficient</i> poly-log(k) compression that matches MOG. The solver gets a free humus at Sayeed’s, my treat!</p>

<p>A couple months from now <a href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~doria/">Dorit Aharonov</a>, <a href="http://www.davidgosset.com/">David Gosset</a> and myself will be giving a short 3.5-day “Spring School” that is meant to be an introduction to recent topics in quantum computing, directed at young researchers in theoretical computer science at large. The <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~slovett/workshops/quantum-computation-2018/">school</a> is organized by Shachar Lovett at the University of California in San Diego, from March 19th to 22nd (these dates coincide with Spring break at many universities). Shachar has been organizing such schools successfully for multiple years now (<a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~slovett/workshops/sum-of-squares-2017/">last year’s school</a> was taught by Boaz Barak and David Steurer on Sums of Squares), and we hope that this year’s will be just as fun (and instructive). The (free) registration deadline is on February 1st, and we have limited funds available to support travel for a few needy students apply <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~slovett/workshops/quantum-computation-2018/">here</a> by February 1st.</p>
<p>The past two years, and possibly even more so the coming couple years, may well be remembered as the moment when quantum computing entered the mainstream. Most of us have heard of IBM’s <a href="https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx">quantum computer in the cloud</a>, of Google’s effort in <a href="https://research.google.com/pubs/QuantumAI.html">, and of Microsoft’s naturally fault-tolerant \href</a>. Some of us might also have encountered a few of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_involved_in_quantum_computing_or_communication">dozens of startups</a> promising everything from quantum hardware to quantum learning, that seem to be appearing out of nowhere, raising capital in just a few months.</p>
<p>It is an interesting question, better left for wiser times, whether these events will be remembered as the initial sparks of a revolution in computing, or as the height of a “quantum bubble”. Bubble or no bubble, quantum information science is here to stay: while current developments make topics such as the computational power of small-scale quantum computers, the possibilities for testing quantum mechanics, all the more exciting, quantum cryptography, the theory of quantum error-correction, the ever-increasing applications of “quantum techniques” to problems from theoretical computer science, do not hinge on the success of current experiments.</p>
<p>In guise of teaser, our plan for the school is roughly as follows. Each day will have about 6 hours of lecture, a couple hours of informal “TA sessions” (to learn a language, one needs to practice it!), and some time for social interaction. This is a fairly heavy schedule, but if these are the 3.5 days you are going to spend learning about quantum information in your career, we want them to be useful. What this means is that we’ll simultaneously aim to cover the basics, so as to establish a common language, while quickly zooming in to a selection of the most interesting questions, such as the power of alternate models of quantum computation, the theory of quantum error-correction and fault-tolerance, or problems in quantum testing and quantum delegation.</p>
<p>In a little more detail, and although you should not treat this as contractual information, here is a sketch of our program for the school:</p>
<p><b>Day 1:</b> Introduction to quantum information: one qubit, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />qubits, the quantum circuit model, simple algorithms and computational speed-ups in the query model. Introduction to quantum complexity: the class QMA and the local Hamiltonian problem.</p>
<p><b>Day 2:</b> Protocols for delegating quantum computations. The adiabatic model of computation and its equivalence to the circuit model. Quantum error-correction, stabilizer codes, and fault tolerance.</p>
<p><b>Day 3:</b> Restricted models of computation (shallow circuits, commuting circuits). Testing quantum systems. The quantum PCP conjecture and connection to many-body entanglement. Multi-prover interactive proofs with multiple provers sharing entanglement. Quantum linearity testing.</p>
<p><b>Day 4:</b> More restricted models of computation. Quantum optimization algorithms. Stoquastic Hamiltonians. Quantum Monte-Carlo and simulation.</p>
<p>If you’re not an expert in quantum information, a lot of these topics might not make much sense a priori. This is why you should come! Our goal in these 3.5 days is to summarize what we believe ought to be the highlights of a couple semesters’ worth of graduate courses in quantum information. Aside from the basics in the first day, each lecture will cover a topic of current interest, giving you the ability to understand the importance of recent progress, and start thinking about some of the more TCS-friendly problems. Towards this, we’ll highlight as many open problems as we can think of (and fit in the alloted time), and allow ample time for questions, discussions, and hands-on exercise sessions. Join us: register <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~slovett/workshops/quantum-computation-2018/">here</a>!</p></div>

<p>I recently had the privilege to serve as program committee (PC) chair for the yearly conference on quantum cryptography, <a href="http://2017.qcrypt.net/">QCRYPT’17</a> (note: for obvious public-relations reasons all names of conferences, PC members and authors in this post have been replaced by <em>entirely</em> fictional aliases). Although I had served on the PC of QCRYPT (and other conferences and workshops in quantum information and theoretical computer science) before, this was my first experience as chair. Since I am not aware of any publicly available resources that would help prepare one for this task, I thought I would share selected aspects of my experience here.</p>
<p>It is easiest to organize the discussion in chronological order: I will go through all the steps (and missteps), from the initial invitation email to the final notification to authors (probably safer to stop there – the next step would drag me into a discussion of the authors’ reaction, the consequences of which even the use of aliases may not save me from).</p>
<h2><b>Lights:</b></h2>
<p>You just received that glowing email — “Dear XX, would you be interested to serve as PC chair for ConfY’18?”. Followed by the obligatory series of flattering comments. Such an honor… who would refuse? But don’t jump on that reply-send button just now. Here are a few points to take into consideration before making the decision.</p>
<p>First off, carefully consider the reviewing schedule. The dates of the conference are likely decided already, giving you a good sense of when the submission and notification deadlines will fall. The period in-between represents two to four months of your working life. Are you ready to give them up? I estimate that most days within that period you will have to allocate one to two hours’ work to the PC reviewing process (the load is not evenly spread: during the reviewing phase, it depends how many papers you assign yourself to review; during the discussion phase, it depends on how active you are, whether there is an in-person meeting, etc.). This is a serious commitment, comparable in load to taking on an additional 12-week teaching job. So if you’re already planning on teaching two courses during the same period – think twice.</p>
<p>A second point to consider discussing upfront with the steering committee (SC) is your “mission”. The SC probably has its own idea of the scope of the conference (there might even be a charter), how many papers they would like to be accepted, what justifies a “ConfY-worthy paper”, etc. How rigid are they going to be regarding these points? How much interference can you expect — do you have full latitude in deciding final acceptances (should be)? How flexible is the final number of accepts?</p>
<p>Last but not least, make sure this is something you <em>want</em> to do. How good is ConfY? Does it serve a specific purpose that you value? How often have you attended, or served on the PC? Do you feel competent to make decisions across all areas covered by the conference? Check the past couple years’ accepts. Many conferences are broader than we think, just because when we attend we tend to unconsciously apply a selective bias towards those talks for which we can at least parse the title. This time you’ll have to understand the contents of every single one of the submitted (let alone accepted) papers. So again, is this something you {\textit want} to do?</p>
<h2><b>Camera,</b></h2>
<p><b>Selecting the PC.</b> Now that the fatal decision has been made, my first piece of advice is all too simple: <em>seek advice</em>. Your first task is to form a PC. This is clearly the most influential decision you will make, both in terms of the quality and content of the final program, as well as the ease with which you and your “team” will get there. Choosing a PC is a delicate balancing act. A good mix of seniority and young blood is needed: seniority for the experience, the perspective, and the credibility; young blood for the energy, the taste for novelty, the muscle power. It is a good idea to involve a PC member from the previous installment of the conference; this may in particular help with the more difficult cases of resubmission.</p>
<p>I was fortunate to receive multiple recommendations from the SC, past conference chairs, and colleagues. While you obviously want to favor diversity and broad representation of topic areas, I also recommend selecting PC members with whom one has a personal connection. My experience has been that the amount of effort any one person is willing to put into the PC process varies hugely. It is inevitable that some PC members will eventually drift away. The more connection you have to them the easier it will be to handle irresponsiveness or divergences of opinion.</p>
<p>The more important comment I will make, one which I wish I had been more keenly aware of, is to <em>know your PC</em>. You will eventually select a team of researchers with complementary qualities, not only in terms of the areas that they are familiar with but also in more human terms: some will be good at responding to “quick opinion” calls on difficult papers, while others will have insightful comments about the overall balance of papers in the emerging list of accepted papers, or generate thoughtful advice on the handling of the more tricky cases, etc. At multiple points in the process you will need help; it is crucial to know the right person to turn to, lest you waste precious days or make ill-informed decisions.</p>
<p>With a list of names in hand, you are ready to send out invitations. (Before doing so, consider forming a rough schedule for the reviewing process. This will be needed for PC members to decide whether they will be sufficiently available during the requisite periods.) In my experience this part went smoothly.

Filling in the remaining slots took a little more time. A small tip: if a researcher does not respond to your invitation within a reasonable delay, or is slow to decide whether to join or not, don’t push too hard: while you need a strong PC, you also need a responsive PC. It is not a good idea to start off in a situation where someone is “doing you a favor” by accepting the invitation as a result of some heavy arm-twisting.</p>
<p><b>Drafting a CFP.</b> The second main item on your pre-submission agenda is the drafting of a call for papers (CFP). This may be done in cooperation with the SC. CFP from previous years can serve as a starting point. Check with last year’s PC chair if they were happy with the wording used, or if they have a posteriori recommendations: did they omit an important area of interest? Were the submission instructions, including formatting guidelines, clear?</p>
<p>A good CFP balances out two conflicting desirata: first, it should make your life easier by ensuring that submissions follow a reasonably homogeneous format, and are presented in a way that facilitates the reviewing process; second, it should not place an unreasonable burden on the authors who, as we all know, have better things to do (and will read the instructions, if they ever read them, no earlier than 23:59 in any timezone – making an overly precise CFP a sure recipe for disaster).</p>
<p>One place where precision <em>is</em> needed is in the formulation of the requirements for rigor and completeness. Are full proofs expected, or will a short 3-page abstract suffice? Or should it be both – a short abstract clearly presenting the main ideas, together with a full paper providing precise complete proofs? Be warned that, whatever the guidelines, they will be stretched, forcing you into quick judgment calls as to whether a submission fits the CFP guidelines.</p>
<p>You should also pay attention to the part of the CFP that concerns the scope of the conference: although for all I know this is all but ignored by most authors, and varies little from year to year, it does play an important role in carving out an inch of originality and specificity for the conference.</p>
<p>Another item on the CFP is the “key dates” that will bound the time available for the reviewing process: the submission deadline and the notification date. Here again there are conflicting requirements: the submission date should be as late as possible (to ensure accepted papers are as fresh as possible by the time the conference takes place), the reviewing phase as long as possible (you’re going to need it…), and the notification as early as possible (so there is time to compile proceedings, when they exist, and for authors to make travel arrangements). In my experience as PC member the time allocated for reviewing almost invariably felt too long – yes, I did write <em>too long</em>. However much time is allocated for the reviewing phase invariably ends up divided into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csim+90%5C%25%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sim 90\%}" class="latex" title="{\sim 90\%}" /> procrastination and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csim+20%5C%25%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sim 20\%}" class="latex" title="{\sim 20\%}" /> actual reviewing effort (obviously the actual reviewing gets under way too late for it to be completed by the reviewing deadline, which typically gets overstretched by some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csim+10%5C%25%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sim 10\%}" class="latex" title="{\sim 10\%}" />). I suggest that a good calendar should allocate a month for collecting reviews, and a month for discussion. This is tight but sufficient, and will ensure that everyone remains engaged throughout. A month for reviewing allows a week for going through papers and identifying those for which external help should be sought; 2-3 weeks for actual reviewing; and a week for collecting reviews, putting the scores together, and scrambling through the last-minute calls for help. Similarly, a month of discussion would allow a week for score homogenization, two weeks to narrow down on the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B20%5C%25%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{20\%}" class="latex" title="{20\%}" /> (say) borderline papers, and a final week to make those tough ultimate decisions. Tight, but feasible. Remember: however much time you allocate, will be taken up!</p>
<p>Now, as good a calendar you may have come up with, <em>plan for delays</em>. In my case I typically informed PC members that “reviews have to be completed by April 29th” and “the discussion phase will start on May 1st”. The “hidden” three days in-between the two dates were more than needed to track down missing reviews. Don’t ask PC members to complete a task the day you need the task completed, as it simply won’t happen: people have busy schedules, operate in different (and sometimes shifting) timezones, and have other deadlines to deal with. To respect your PC you ought to give them a precise calendar that you will follow, so they are able to plan ahead; but you also need to allow for the unavoidable time conflicts, last-minute no-shows, and other unpredictable events.</p>
<p>One last item before you break off. To set up the submissions webpage you’ll need to decide on a reviewing management software. I (quite mistakenly) didn’t give much thought to this. As PC member I had had a decent experience with <a href="http://easychair.org/">easychair</a>, and was under the impression that it was the most commonly used software – and would therefore be easiest to work with for the PC. Even though things went, on the whole, fairly smoothly, I had more than one occasion to regret the decision. The topic would deserve a blog post in itself, and I won’t expand here. Just make sure you carefully consider how easy the software will make different parts of the reviewing process, such as computing statistics, tracking missing reviews, ordering papers based on various criteria, allowing an efficient tagging system to keep track of memos or tentative decisions, handling communication with authors (including possibly the compilation of proceedings), etc.</p>
<h2><b>Action!</b></h2>
<p>Alright, so you went for a stroll and enjoyed your most leisurely conference submission deadline ever – as PC chair, you’re probably not allowed to submit – but the bell has rung, the submission sever closed…now it’s your turn!</p>
<p><b>The last few hours.</b> Actually, maybe this wasn’t quite your most leisurely submission deadline after all. I was advised to elect a “midnight <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe">anywhere on earth</a>” deadline, as this supposedly made the guideline easier to comprehend for everyone. Not only do I now have strong evidence that I am not the only one to find this denomination absurdly confusing – where on earth is this place anyways, anywhere on earth?? – I would in any case strongly suggest setting a deadline that falls at a reasonable time in the PC chair’s timezone. You <em>will</em> get email from people unable to access the submission server (for whatever reason), unsure whether their submission fits the guidelines, asking whether they can get an extension, etc. It is more helpful if you can deal with such email as they arrive, rather than the next day.</p>
<p><b>Paper bidding.</b> Before reviewing can get under way you need to assign papers to PC members. And before you can assign papers, PC members need to express their preferences. The resulting allocation is critical. It determines how many headaches you will face later on: how many papers will have low confidence reviews, how many closely related papers will have been reviewed by disjoint sets of PC members, how many papers will live on the enthusiastic scores of expert <em>sub</em>reviewers. I found this phase challenging. An automatic assignment can be completed in milliseconds, but doesn’t take into account related submissions or expertise of PC members aside from their declared preference, which is a single noisy bit of information. I highly recommend (I realize I am “highly recommending” a lot of things for a first-timer – I only wish I had been told some of these ahead of time!) taking the process very seriously, and spending enough time to review, and tweak, the automatic assignment before it is made final.</p>
<p><b>Refereeing.</b> Each PC member now has a healthy batch of papers assigned, and a deadline by which to submit reviews. What kind of guidelines can you give to make the process as smooth as possible? Discrepancies in scores are always an issue: whichever reviewing software you use, it is bound to produce some kind of score-based ranking; this initial ranking, although it will change during the discussion phase, induces a huge bias in final decisions (this effect is exacerbated for conferences, such as QCRYPT, where there is no in-person meeting). I don’t have a magic solution to this, but establishing clear guidelines in terms of the significance and expected proportion for each numerical score helps. I eventually found it necessary to prod outliers to modify their scores. This is one of the things easychair did not make particularly easy, forcing me to download data in Excel format and run some basic home-made scripts on the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Aside from scoring, it is useful to include precise guidelines on the use of sub-referees and conflicts of interest (COIs). I allowed sub-refereeing but insisted that the final opinion should be the PC member’s. (It is not ok to copy-paste a sub-review while barely having gone through it!) Unfortunately sub-reviewers tend to be experts, and experts tend to be overly enthusiastic: watch out for papers that received three high scores, each of which with high confidence: easychair will rank those right at the top, but they may well be worth a second look.</p>
<p>Regarding COIs, I did not set overly strict rules (with the idea that “everyone knows when it is appropriate to declare a COI”), and regretted it. It is simply too uncomfortable to realize at a late stage that this very enthusiastic review was written by a PC member who happens to be a close collaborator of one of the authors, but chose not to disclose the COI. Do you discard the review? I don’t know. It depends: maybe the source of the COI played a role in the PC member’s vocal defense of the paper, and maybe not. Better not let it happen. It is not necessarily that even weak COI should forbid reviewing, but rather that COIs should be made explicit. As long as everyone states their position, things are in the open and can be taken into account.</p>
<p><b>Discussion.</b> With all the reviews in (dream on… some reasonable fraction of the reviews in) begins the second phase of the reviewing process, the discussion phase. Success of this phase rests almost entirely on engagement of the PC chair and a few dedicated, dynamic PC members. Among PCs I have sat on the most satisfying were ones where the chair visibly spent large amounts of energy in the stimulation of online discussion. This is no trivial task: we all lead busy lives, and it is easy to let things slip; papers with high scores get in, low scores get out; a few days to discuss the few in the middle and we’ll be done…not so! Unfortunately, the initial ranking is bound to be <em>abysmal</em>. It is necessary to work to straighten things up. Some basic tricks apply: search for papers with high discrepancies in scores, low confidence, missing, very short, or uninformative reviews, etc. It is useful to individually prod PC members to keep the discussion going. This is a place where the “know your PC” recommendation comes in: for each submission, you need to be able to identify who will be able to clarify the arguments in favor and against the paper; who will have the technical expertise to clarify the relationship between papers X and Y, etc. It’s an exhausting, but highly rewarding process: I learned a lot by listening to my colleagues and trying to grasp at times rather subtle – and opinionated – arguments that could reach quite far from my expertise.</p>
<p><b>Decisions!</b> The discussion has been going on for a couple weeks, and you already only have little time left: it is time to start making decisions. Proceeding in phases seems popular, and effective. It helps to progressively sharpen the acceptance threshold. As long as there are too many papers in play it is very hard to get a sense of where the boundary will lie; typically, far too many papers will have positive scores and enthusiastic proponents than can ultimately be accepted.</p>
<p>However much ahead of time you get started, the real decisions will take place in the last few days. I found it helpful to set a clear calendar for the process, marking days when decisions would be made, identifying clear categories (accept, accept?, discuss!, etc.), and setting explicit targets for each phase (accept X/reject Y many more papers, etc.), even if I wasn’t always able to meet them. It is also important that the PC as a whole be aware of the target number of papers that is to be accepted. I have frequently been on PC where the chair gave us the information that “we will accept all great papers”, only to learn later that a hard limit had (of course) been set. Conversely, I’ve also been extremely annoyed at last-minute decisions along the lines of, well, we accepted about as much we could, but there’s 4 left undecided cases, and, well, they’re all really good, so why don’t we just stretch the program a bit and accept all 4 at the last minute. To me this is the PC not doing its job… be prepared to make difficult decisions! Make it clear to the PC (and to yourself) what your goal is. Is it to serve the authors, the conference attendees, the advancement of science – all of the above (good luck)?</p>
<h2><b>Post-mortem</b></h2>
<p>This was fun. Exhausting, but fun. Of course not all authors (or PC members) were happy. There will be complaints. And some of them will be justified: there is no perfect allocation. Mistakes happen. We did our best!</p>
<p>Some tasks lie down the road. Put a program together. Help select a best (student) paper. Gather statistics for the business meeting. But first things first: take a deep breath. This was fun.</p></div>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">[<strong>7/9/17 Update</strong>: Following a suggestion by Oded Regev I upgraded Section 1 from “probabilistic functions” to “matrix-valued functions”. This hopefully makes it a more useful, and interesting, mid-point between the classical analysis of BLR and the non-abelian extension discussed afterwards. I also fixed a bunch of typos — I apologize for the many remaining ones. The <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/pauli_braiding_1.pdf">pdf</a> has also been fixed.]</span></p>
<p>Last week Anand Natarajan from MIT presented our joint work on “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03574">A Quantum Linearity Test for Robustly Verifying Entanglement</a>” at the <a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2017/">STOC’17</a> conference in Montreal. Since we first posted our paper on the quant-ph arXiv, Anand and I discovered that the test and its analysis could be reformulated in a more general framework of tests for group relations, and rounding of approximate group representations to exact group representations. This reformulation is stimulated by a beautiful paper by Gowers and Hatami on “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04085">Inverse and stability theorems for approximate representations of finite groups</a>”, which was first pointed to me by William Slofstra. The purpose of this post is to present the Gowers-Hatami result as a natural extension of the Blum-Luby-Rubinfeld linearity test to the non-abelian setting, with application to entanglement testing. (Of course Gowers and Hatami are well aware of this — though maybe not of the application to entanglement tests!) My hope in doing so is to make our result more accessible, and hopefully draw some of my readers from theoretical computer science into a beautiful area.</p>
<p>I will strive to make the post self-contained and accessible, with no quantum information background required — indeed, most of the content is purely — dare I say elegantly — mathematical. In the interest of being precise (and working out better parameters for our result than appear in our paper) I include essentially full proofs, though I may allow myself to skip a line or two in some of the calculations.</p>
<p>Given the post remains rather equation-heavy, here is a <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/pauli_braiding_1.pdf">pdf</a> with the same contents; it may be more convenient to read.</p>
<p>I am grateful to Anand, and Oded Regev and John Wright, for helpful comments on a preliminary version of this post.</p>
<p><b>1. Linearity testing</b></p>
<p>The Blum-Luby-Rubinfeld linearity test provides a means to certify that a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%3A%7B%5Cmathbb+Z%7D_2%5En%5Crightarrow%5C%7B%5Cpm1+%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f:{\mathbb Z}_2^n\rightarrow\{\pm1 \}}" class="latex" title="{f:{\mathbb Z}_2^n\rightarrow\{\pm1 \}}" /> is close to a linear function. The test can be formulated as a two-player game:</p>
<p><b>BLR linearity test:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) The referee selects <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%2Cb%5Cin%7B%5Cmathbb+Z%7D_2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a,b\in{\mathbb Z}_2^n}" class="latex" title="{a,b\in{\mathbb Z}_2^n}" /> uniformly at random. He sends the pair <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28a%2Cb%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(a,b)}" class="latex" title="{(a,b)}" /> to one player, and either <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a}" class="latex" title="{a}" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b}" class="latex" title="{b}" />, or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%2Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a+b}" class="latex" title="{a+b}" /> (chosen uniformly at random) to the other.</li>
<li>(b) The first player replies with two bits, and the second player with a single bit. The referee accepts if and only if the player’s answers satisfy the natural consistency constraint.</li>
</ul>
<p>This test, as all others considered here, treats both players symmetrically. This allows us to restrict our attention to the case of players who both apply the same strategy, an assumption I will systematically make from now on.</p>
<p>Blum et al.’s result states that any strategy for the players in the linearity test must provide answers chosen according to a function that is close to linear. In this section I will provide a slight “matrix-valued” extension of the BLR result, that follows almost directly from the usual Fourier-analytic proof but will help clarify the extension to the non-abelian case.</p>
<p><b>1.1. Matrix-valued strategies</b></p>
<p>The “classical” analysis of the BLR test starts by modeling an arbitrary strategy for the players as a pair of functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%3A%7B%5Cmathbb+Z%7D_2%5En%5Crightarrow+%5C%7B%5Cpm+1%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f:{\mathbb Z}_2^n\rightarrow \{\pm 1\}}" class="latex" title="{f:{\mathbb Z}_2^n\rightarrow \{\pm 1\}}" /> (for the second player, who receives a single string as query) and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%27%3A%7B%5Cmathbb+Z%7D_2%5En+%5Ctimes+%7B%5Cmathbb+Z%7D_2%5En+%5Crightarrow+%5C%7B%5Cpm+1%5C%7D%5Ctimes%5C%7B%5Cpm+1%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f':{\mathbb Z}_2^n \times {\mathbb Z}_2^n \rightarrow \{\pm 1\}\times\{\pm 1\}}" class="latex" title="{f':{\mathbb Z}_2^n \times {\mathbb Z}_2^n \rightarrow \{\pm 1\}\times\{\pm 1\}}" /> (for the first player, who receives a pair of strings as query). In doing so we are making an assumption: that the players are deterministic. More generally, we should allow “probabilistic strategies”, which can be modeled via “probabilistic functions” <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%3A%7B%5Cmathbb+Z%7D_2%5En+%5Ctimes+%5COmega+%5Crightarrow+%5C%7B%5Cpm+1%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f:{\mathbb Z}_2^n \times \Omega \rightarrow \{\pm 1\}}" class="latex" title="{f:{\mathbb Z}_2^n \times \Omega \rightarrow \{\pm 1\}}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%27%3A%7B%5Cmathbb+Z%7D_2%5En+%5Ctimes+%7B%5Cmathbb+Z%7D_2%5En+%5Ctimes%5COmega%5Crightarrow+%5C%7B%5Cpm+1%5C%7D%5Ctimes%5C%7B%5Cpm+1%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f':{\mathbb Z}_2^n \times {\mathbb Z}_2^n \times\Omega\rightarrow \{\pm 1\}\times\{\pm 1\}}" class="latex" title="{f':{\mathbb Z}_2^n \times {\mathbb Z}_2^n \times\Omega\rightarrow \{\pm 1\}\times\{\pm 1\}}" /> respectively, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%5COmega%2C%5Cmu%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(\Omega,\mu)}" class="latex" title="{(\Omega,\mu)}" /> is an arbitrary probability space which plays the role of shared randomness between the players. Note that the usual claim that “probabilistic strategies are irrelevant because they can succeed no better than deterministic strategies” is somewhat moot here: the point is not to investigate success probabilities — it is easy to pass the BLR test with probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" /> — but rather derive structural consequences from the assumption that a certain strategy passes the test. In this respect, enlarging the kinds of strategies we consider valid can shed new light on the strengths, and weaknesses, of the test.</p>
<p>Thus, and with an eye towards the “quantum” analysis to come, let us consider an even broader set of strategies, which I’ll refer to as “matrix-valued” strategies. A natural matrix-valued analogue of a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%3A%7B%5Cmathbb+Z%7D_2%5En+%5Crightarrow+%5C%7B%5Cpm+1%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f:{\mathbb Z}_2^n \rightarrow \{\pm 1\}}" class="latex" title="{f:{\mathbb Z}_2^n \rightarrow \{\pm 1\}}" /> is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%3A%7B%5Cmathbb+Z%7D_2%5En+%5Crightarrow+O_d%28%7B%5Cmathbb+C%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F:{\mathbb Z}_2^n \rightarrow O_d({\mathbb C})}" class="latex" title="{F:{\mathbb Z}_2^n \rightarrow O_d({\mathbb C})}" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO_d%28%7B%5Cmathbb+C%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O_d({\mathbb C})}" class="latex" title="{O_d({\mathbb C})}" /> is the set of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%5Ctimes+d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d\times d}" class="latex" title="{d\times d}" /> Hermitian matrices that square to identity (equivalently, have all eigenvalues in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B%5Cpm+1%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\{\pm 1\}}" class="latex" title="{\{\pm 1\}}" />); these matrices are called “observables” in quantum mechanics. Similarly, we may generalize a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%27%3A%7B%5Cmathbb+Z%7D_2%5En+%5Ctimes+%7B%5Cmathbb+Z%7D_2%5En+%5Crightarrow+%5C%7B%5Cpm+1+%5C%7D+%5Ctimes+%5C%7B%5Cpm+1%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f':{\mathbb Z}_2^n \times {\mathbb Z}_2^n \rightarrow \{\pm 1 \} \times \{\pm 1\}}" class="latex" title="{f':{\mathbb Z}_2^n \times {\mathbb Z}_2^n \rightarrow \{\pm 1 \} \times \{\pm 1\}}" /> to a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%27%3A%7B%5Cmathbb+Z%7D_2%5En+%5Ctimes+%7B%5Cmathbb+Z%7D_2%5En+%5Crightarrow+O_d%28%7B%5Cmathbb+C%7D%29+%5Ctimes+O_d%28%7B%5Cmathbb+C%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F':{\mathbb Z}_2^n \times {\mathbb Z}_2^n \rightarrow O_d({\mathbb C}) \times O_d({\mathbb C})}" class="latex" title="{F':{\mathbb Z}_2^n \times {\mathbb Z}_2^n \rightarrow O_d({\mathbb C}) \times O_d({\mathbb C})}" />. Here we’ll impose an additional requirement: any pair <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28B%2CC%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(B,C)}" class="latex" title="{(B,C)}" /> in the range of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F'}" class="latex" title="{F'}" /> should be such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C}" class="latex" title="{C}" /> commute.

<p>where the last equality follows by expanding the Fourier coefficients and noticing the appropriate cancellation. Together with <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/feed/#eqapprox-linear">(2)</a>, this proves the theorem. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CBox&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\Box" class="latex" title="\Box" /></p>
<p>At the risk of sounding yet more pedantic, it might be useful to comment on the relation between this proof and the usual argument. The main observation in Bellare et al.’s proof is that approximate linearity, expressed by <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/feed/#eqapprox-linear">(2)</a>, implies a lower bound on the sum of the <em>cubes</em> of the Fourier coefficients of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f}" class="latex" title="{f}" />. Together with Parseval’s formula, this bound implies the existence of a large Fourier coefficient, which identifies a close-by linear function.</p>
<p>The proof I gave decouples the argument. Its first step, the construction of the isometry <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{V}" class="latex" title="{V}" /> depends on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" />, but does not use anything regarding approximate linearity. It only uses Parseval’s formula to argue that the isometry is well-defined. A noteworthy feature of this step is that the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" /> on the extended space is always well-defined as well: given a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" />, it is always possible to consider the linear matrix-valued function which “samples <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" /> according to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Chat%7BF%7D%28S%29%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\hat{F}(S)^2}" class="latex" title="{\hat{F}(S)^2}" />” and then returns <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cchi_S%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\chi_S(x)}" class="latex" title="{\chi_S(x)}" />. The second step of the proof evaluates the correlation of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> with the “pull-back” of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" />, and observes that this correlation is precisely our measure of “approximate linearity” of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" />, concluding the proof without having had to explicitly notice that there existed a large Fourier coefficient.</p>
<p><b>1.3. The group-theoretic perspective</b></p>
<p>Let’s re-interpret the proof we just gave using group-theoretic language. A linear function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%3A+%7B%5Cmathbb+Z%7D_2%5En%5Crightarrow%5C%7B%5Cpm+1%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{g: {\mathbb Z}_2^n\rightarrow\{\pm 1\}}" class="latex" title="{g: {\mathbb Z}_2^n\rightarrow\{\pm 1\}}" /> is, by definition, a mapping which respects the additive group structure on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathbb+Z%7D_2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{{\mathbb Z}_2^n}" class="latex" title="{{\mathbb Z}_2^n}" />, namely it is a representation. Since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%3D%28%7B%5Cmathbb+Z%7D_2%5En%2C%2B%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G=({\mathbb Z}_2^n,+)}" class="latex" title="{G=({\mathbb Z}_2^n,+)}" /> is an abelian group, it has <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7CG%7C%3D2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{|G|=2^n}" class="latex" title="{|G|=2^n}" /> irreducible <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />-dimensional representations, given by the characters <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cchi_S%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\chi_S}" class="latex" title="{\chi_S}" />. As such, the linear function defined in the proof of Theorem <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/feed/#thmblr">2</a> is nothing but a list of all irreducible representations of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" />.</p>
<p>The condition <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/feed/#eqapprox-linear">(2)</a> derived in the proof of the theorem can be interpreted as the condition that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> is an “approximate representation” of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" />.

In the next section I will make the words in quotes precise and generalize the result to the case of arbitrary finite groups.</p>
<p><b>2. Approximate representations of non-abelian groups</b></p>
<p><b>2.1. The Gowers-Hatami theorem</b></p>
<p>In their paper Gowers and Hatami consider the problem of “rounding” approximate group representations to exact representations. I highly recommend the paper, which gives a thorough introduction to the topic, including multiple motivations. Here I will state and prove a slightly more general, but quantitatively weaker, variant of their result inspired by the somewhat convoluted analysis of the BLR test given in the previous section.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 4 (Gowers-Hatami)</b> <em><a name="thmgh"></a>Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" /> be a finite group, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cvarepsilon%5Cgeq+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\varepsilon\geq 0}" class="latex" title="{\varepsilon\geq 0}" />, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%3AG%5Crightarrow+U_d%28%7B%5Cmathbb+C%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f:G\rightarrow U_d({\mathbb C})}" class="latex" title="{f:G\rightarrow U_d({\mathbb C})}" /> an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%5Cvarepsilon%2C%5Csigma%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(\varepsilon,\sigma)}" class="latex" title="{(\varepsilon,\sigma)}" />-representation of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" />.

<p>Gowers and Hatami limit themselves to the case of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma+%3D+d%5E%7B-1%7DI_d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma = d^{-1}I_d}" class="latex" title="{\sigma = d^{-1}I_d}" />, which corresponds to the dimension-normalized Frobenius norm. In this scenario they in addition obtain a tight control of the dimension <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d'}" class="latex" title="{d'}" />, and show that one can always take <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%27%5C+%3D+%281%2BO%28%5Cvarepsilon%29%29d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d'\ = (1+O(\varepsilon))d}" class="latex" title="{d'\ = (1+O(\varepsilon))d}" /> in the theorem. I will give a much shorter proof than theirs (the proof is implicit in their argument) that does not seem to allow to recover this estimate. (It is possible to adapt their proof to keep a control of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d'}" class="latex" title="{d'}" /> even in the case of general <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma}" class="latex" title="{\sigma}" />, but I will not explain this here.) Essentially the same proof as the one sketched below has been extended to some classes of infinite groups by De Chiffre, Ozawa and Thom in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04544.pdf">recent preprint</a>.</p>
<p>Note that, contrary to the BLR theorem, where the “embedding” is not strictly necessary (if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\varepsilon}" class="latex" title="{\varepsilon}" /> is small enough we can identify a single close-by linear function), as noted by Gowers and Hatami Theorem <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/feed/#thmgh">4</a> does not in general hold with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%27%3Dd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d'=d}" class="latex" title="{d'=d}" />. The reason is that it is possible for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" /> to have an approximate representation in some dimension <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" />, but no exact representation of the same dimension: to obtain an example of this, take any group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" /> that has all non-trivial irreducible representations of large enough dimension, and create an approximate representation in e.g. dimension one less by “cutting off” one row and column from an exact representation. The dimension normalization induced by the norm <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7C%5Ccdot%5C%7C_%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\|\cdot\|_\sigma}" class="latex" title="{\|\cdot\|_\sigma}" /> will barely notice this, but it will be impossible to “round” the approximate representation obtained to an exact one without modifying the dimension.</p>
<p>The necessity for the embedding helps distinguish the Gowers-Hatami result from other extensions of the linearity test to the non-abelian setting, such as the work by Ben-Or et al. on <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2004/052/">non-Abelian homomorphism testing</a> (I thank Oded Regev for pointing me to the paper). In that paper the authors show that a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%3AG%5Crightarrow+H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f:G\rightarrow H}" class="latex" title="{f:G\rightarrow H}" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{H}" class="latex" title="{H}" /> are finite non-abelian groups, which satisfies <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPr%28+f%28x%29f%28y%29%3Df%28xy%29+%29+%5Cgeq+1-%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\Pr( f(x)f(y)=f(xy) ) \geq 1-\varepsilon}" class="latex" title="{\Pr( f(x)f(y)=f(xy) ) \geq 1-\varepsilon}" />, is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Cvarepsilon%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(\varepsilon)}" class="latex" title="{O(\varepsilon)}" />-close to a homomorphism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%3AG%5Crightarrow+H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{g:G\rightarrow H}" class="latex" title="{g:G\rightarrow H}" />. The main difference with the setting for the Gowers-Hatami result is that since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{H}" class="latex" title="{H}" /> is finite, Ben-Or et al. use the Kronecker <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta}" class="latex" title="{\delta}" /> function as distance on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{H}" class="latex" title="{H}" />. This allows them to employ combinatorial arguments, and provide a rounding procedure that does not need to modify the range space (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{H}" class="latex" title="{H}" />). In contrast, here the unitary group is infinite.</p>
<p>The main ingredient needed to extend the analysis of the BLR test is an appropriate notion of Fourier transform over non-abelian groups. Given an irreducible representation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%3A+G+%5Crightarrow+U_%7Bd_%5Crho%7D%28%7B%5Cmathbb+C%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\rho: G \rightarrow U_{d_\rho}({\mathbb C})}" class="latex" title="{\rho: G \rightarrow U_{d_\rho}({\mathbb C})}" />, define<a name="eqfourier"></a></p>

<p>With the upcoming application to entanglement testing in mind, I will state a version of Theorem <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/feed/#thmgh">4</a> tailored to the group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%5E%7B%28n%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{H^{(n)}}" class="latex" title="{H^{(n)}}" /> and a specific choice of presentation for the group relations. Towards this we first need to recall the notion of <em>Schmidt decomposition</em> of a bipartite state (i.e. unit vector) <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpsi+%5Cin+%7B%5Cmathbb+C%7D%5Ed+%5Cotimes+%7B%5Cmathbb+C%7D%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\psi \in {\mathbb C}^d \otimes {\mathbb C}^d}" class="latex" title="{\psi \in {\mathbb C}^d \otimes {\mathbb C}^d}" />.

The reason for including only those relations is that they are the ones that it will be possible to test; see the next section for this.

<p><b>3. Entanglement testing</b></p>
<p>Our discussion so far has barely touched upon the notion of entanglement. Recall the Schmidt decopmosition <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/feed/#eqschmidt">(7)</a> of a unit vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpsi+%5Cin+%7B%5Cmathbb+C%7D%5Ed%5Cotimes+%7B%5Cmathbb+C%7D%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\psi \in {\mathbb C}^d\otimes {\mathbb C}^d}" class="latex" title="{\psi \in {\mathbb C}^d\otimes {\mathbb C}^d}" />, and the associated reduced density matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma}" class="latex" title="{\sigma}" /> defined in <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/feed/#eqsigma">(8)</a>. The state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpsi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\psi}" class="latex" title="{\psi}" /> is called <em>entangled</em> if this matrix has rank larger than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />; equivalently, if there is more than one non-zero coefficient <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\lambda_i}" class="latex" title="{\lambda_i}" /> in <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/feed/#eqschmidt">(7)</a>. The <em>Schmidt rank</em> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpsi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\psi}" class="latex" title="{\psi}" /> is the rank of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma}" class="latex" title="{\sigma}" />, the number of non-zero terms in <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/feed/#eqschmidt">(7)</a>. It is a crude, but convenient, measure of entanglement; in particular it provides a lower bound on the local dimension <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" />. A useful observation is that the Schmidt rank is invariant under local unitary operations: these may affect the Schmidt vectors <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7Bu_i%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\{u_i\}}" class="latex" title="{\{u_i\}}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7Bv_i%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\{v_i\}}" class="latex" title="{\{v_i\}}" />, but not the number of non-zero terms.</p>

<p>Lemma <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/feed/#lemsr">6</a> provides an “experimental road-map” for establishing that a bipartite system is in a highly entangled state:</p>
<ul>
<li>(i) Select a random <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma_P+%3D+%5Cpm%5Csigma_X%28a%29%5Csigma_Z%28b%29+%5Cin+H%5E%7B%28n%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma_P = \pm\sigma_X(a)\sigma_Z(b) \in H^{(n)}}" class="latex" title="{\sigma_P = \pm\sigma_X(a)\sigma_Z(b) \in H^{(n)}}" />;</li>
<li>(ii) Measure both halves of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpsi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\psi}" class="latex" title="{\psi}" /> using <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma_P%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma_P}" class="latex" title="{\sigma_P}" />;</li>
<li>(iii) Check that the outcomes agree.</li>
</ul>
<p>To explain the connection between the above “operational test” and the lemma I should review what a measurement in quantum mechanics is. For our purposes it is enough to talk about binary measurements (i.e. measurements with two outcomes, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{+1}" class="latex" title="{+1}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{-1}" class="latex" title="{-1}" />). Any such measurement is specified by a pair of orthogonal projections, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_%2B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M_+}" class="latex" title="{M_+}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_-%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M_-}" class="latex" title="{M_-}" />, on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathbb+C%7D%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{{\mathbb C}^d}" class="latex" title="{{\mathbb C}^d}" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_%2B%2BM_-+%3D+I_d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M_++M_- = I_d}" class="latex" title="{M_++M_- = I_d}" />. The probability of obtaining outcome <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\pm}" class="latex" title="{\pm}" /> when measuring <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpsi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\psi}" class="latex" title="{\psi}" /> is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7CM_%5Cpm+%5Cpsi%5C%7C%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\|M_\pm \psi\|^2}" class="latex" title="{\|M_\pm \psi\|^2}" />. We can represent a binary measurement succinctly through the <em>observable</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%3DM_%2B-M_-%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M=M_+-M_-}" class="latex" title="{M=M_+-M_-}" />. (In general, an observable is a Hermitian matrix which squares to identity.) It is then the case that if an observable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M}" class="latex" title="{M}" /> is applied on the first half of a state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpsi%5Cin%7B%5Cmathbb+C%7D%5Ed%5Cotimes%7B%5Cmathbb+C%7D%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\psi\in{\mathbb C}^d\otimes{\mathbb C}^d}" class="latex" title="{\psi\in{\mathbb C}^d\otimes{\mathbb C}^d}" />, and another observable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" /> is applied on the second half, then the probability of agreement, minus the probability of disagreement, between the outcomes obtained is precisely <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpsi%5E%2A%28M%5Cotimes+N%29%5Cpsi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\psi^*(M\otimes N)\psi}" class="latex" title="{\psi^*(M\otimes N)\psi}" />, a number which lies in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5B-1%2C1%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{[-1,1]}" class="latex" title="{[-1,1]}" />. Thus the condition that the test described above accepts with probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1-%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1-\varepsilon}" class="latex" title="{1-\varepsilon}" /> when performed on a state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpsi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\psi}" class="latex" title="{\psi}" /> is precisely equivalent to the assumption <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/feed/#eqlem-ass">(13)</a> of Lemma <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/feed/#lemsr">6</a>.</p>
<p>Even though this provides a perfectly fine test for entanglement in principle, practitioners in the foundations of quantum mechanics know all too well that their opponents — e.g. “quantum-skeptics” — will not be satisfied with such an experiment. In particular, who is to guarantee that the measurement performed in step (ii) is really <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csigma_P%5Cotimes%5Csigma_P%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sigma_P\otimes\sigma_P}" class="latex" title="{\sigma_P\otimes\sigma_P}" />, as claimed? To the least, doesn’t this already implicitly assume that the measured system has dimension <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^n}" class="latex" title="{2^n}" />?</p>
<p>This is where the notion of <em>device independence</em> comes in. Briefly, in this context the idea is to obtain the same conclusion (a certificate of high-dimensional entanglement) <em>without</em> any assumption on the measurement performed: the only information to be trusted is classical data (statistics generated by the experiment), but not the operational details of the experiment itself.</p>
<p>This is where Corollary <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/feed/#corgh">5</a> enters the picture. Reformulated in the present context, the corollary provides a means to <em>verify</em> that arbitrary measurements “all but behave” as Pauli measurements, provided they generate the right statistics. To explain how this can be done we need to provide additional “operational tests” that can be used to certify the assumptions of the corollary.</p>
<p><b>3.2. Testing the Weyl-Heisenberg group relations</b></p>
<p>Corollary <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/feed/#corgh">5</a> makes three assumptions about the observables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%28a%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X(a)}" class="latex" title="{X(a)}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%28b%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z(b)}" class="latex" title="{Z(b)}" />: that they satisfy approximate consistency <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/feed/#eqgh-cons">(9)</a>, linearity <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/feed/#eqgh-commute">(10)</a>, and anti-commutation <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/feed/#eqgh-ac">(11)</a>. In this section I will describe two (somewhat well-known) tests that allow to certify these relations based only on the fact that the measurements generate statistics which pass the tests.</p>
<p><b>Linearity test:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) The referee selects <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BW%5Cin%5C%7BX%2CZ%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{W\in\{X,Z\}}" class="latex" title="{W\in\{X,Z\}}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%2Ca%27%5Cin%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a,a'\in\{0,1\}^n}" class="latex" title="{a,a'\in\{0,1\}^n}" /> uniformly at random. He sends <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28W%2Ca%2Ca%27%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(W,a,a')}" class="latex" title="{(W,a,a')}" /> to one player and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28W%2Ca%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(W,a)}" class="latex" title="{(W,a)}" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28W%2Ca%27%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(W,a')}" class="latex" title="{(W,a')}" />, or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28W%2Ca%2Ba%27%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(W,a+a')}" class="latex" title="{(W,a+a')}" /> to the other.</li>
<li>(b) The first player replies with two bits, and the second with a single bit. The referee accepts if and only if the player’s answers are consistent.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always in this note, the test treats both players simultaneously. As a result we can (and will) assume that the player’s strategy is symmetric, and is specified by a permutation-invariant state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpsi%5Cin+%7B%5Cmathbb+C%7D%5Ed+%5Cotimes+%7B%5Cmathbb+C%7D%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\psi\in {\mathbb C}^d \otimes {\mathbb C}^d}" class="latex" title="{\psi\in {\mathbb C}^d \otimes {\mathbb C}^d}" /> and a measurement for each question: an observable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BW%28a%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{W(a)}" class="latex" title="{W(a)}" /> associated to questions of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28W%2Ca%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(W,a)}" class="latex" title="{(W,a)}" />, and a more complicated four-outcome measurement <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7BW%5E%7Ba%2Ca%27%7D%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\{W^{a,a'}\}}" class="latex" title="{\{W^{a,a'}\}}" /> associated with questions of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28W%2Ca%2Ca%27%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(W,a,a')}" class="latex" title="{(W,a,a')}" /> (It will not be necessary to go into the details of the formalism for such measurements).</p>
<p>The linearity test described above is exactly identical to the BLR linearity test described earlier, but for the use of the basis label <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BW%5Cin%5C%7BX%2CZ%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{W\in\{X,Z\}}" class="latex" title="{W\in\{X,Z\}}" />. The lemma below is a direct analogue of Lemma <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/feed/#lemblr-test">1</a>, which extends the analysis to the setting of players sharing entanglement. The lemma was first introduced in a joint <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6375302/">paper</a> with Ito, where we used an extension of the linearity test, Babai et al.’s multilinearity test, to show the inclusion of complexity classes NEXP<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csubseteq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\subseteq}" class="latex" title="{\subseteq}" />MIP<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%2A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{^*}" class="latex" title="{^*}" />.</p>

<p>Testing anti-commutation is slightly more involved. We will achieve this by using a two-player game called the Magic Square game. This is a fascinating game, but just as for the linearity test I will treat it superficially and only recall the part of the analysis that is useful for us (see e.g. the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02074">paper</a> by Wu et al. for a description of the game and a proof of Lemma <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/feed/#lemms">8</a> below).</p>

<div style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">I’ve always admired the beautiful theory on the analysis of boolean functions (see the excellent <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2683783">book</a> of Ryan O’Donnell, as well <a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~kalai/">Gil Kalai’s lectures</a>). Heck, it used to be my main area of investigation back in the early grad-school days we were studying hardness of approximation, the PCP theorem, and the “new” (back at the time) technology of Fourier analysis for boolean functions.  This technology also gave rise to seminal results on learnability with respect to the uniform distribution. Uniform distribution learning has been widely criticized as unrealistic, and the focus of the theoretical machine learning community has shifted to (mostly) convex, real-valued, agnostic learning in recent years.<p></p>
<p>It is thus particularly exciting to me that some of the amazing work on boolean learning can be used for the very practical problem of Hyperparameter Optimization (HO), which has on the face of it nothing to do with the uniform distribution. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00764">Here is the draft</a>, joint work with <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~klivans/">Adam Klivans</a> and <a href="http://www.callowbird.com/">Yang Yuan</a>.</p>

<p>To describe hyperparameter optimization: many software packages, in particular with the rise of deep learning, come with gazillions of input parameters. An example is the TensorFlow software package for training deep nets. To actually use it the user needs to specify how many layers, which layers are convolutional / full connected, which optimization algorithm to use (stochastic gradient descent, AdaGrad, etc.), whether to add momentum to the optimization or not…. You get the picture – choosing the parameters is by itself an optimization problem!</p>
<p>It is a highly non-convex optimization problem, over mostly discrete (but some continuous) choices. Evaluating the function, i.e. training a deep net over a large dataset with a specific configuration, is very expensive, and you cannot assume any other information about the function such as gradients (that are not even defined for discrete functions).  In other words, sample complexity is of the essence, whereas computation complexity can be relaxed as long as no function evaluations are required.</p>
<p>The automatic choice of hyperparameters has been hyped recently with various names such as “auto tuning”, “auto ML”,  and so forth. For an excellent post on existing approaches and their downsides see these posts <a href="http://www.argmin.net/2016/06/20/hypertuning/">Ben Recht’s blog</a>.</p>
<p>This is where harmonic analysis and compressed sensing can be of help! While in general hyperparameter optimization is computationally hard, we assume a sparse Fourier representation of the objective function. Under this assumption, one can use compressed sensing techniques to recover and optimize the underlying function with low sample complexity.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, using sparse recovery techniques one can even improve the known sample complexity results for well-studied problems such as learning decision trees under the uniform distribution, improving upon classical results by <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=174138">Linial, Mansour and Nisan</a>.</p>
<p>Experiments show that the sparsity assumptions in the Fourier domain are justified for certain hyperparameter optimization settings, in particular, when training of deep nets for vision tasks. The harmonic approach (we call the algorithm “Harmonica”) attains a better solution than existing approaches based on multi-armed bandits and Bayesian optimization, and perhaps more importantly, significantly faster. It also beats random search 5X (i.e. random sampling with 5 times as many samples allowed as for our own method, a smart benchmark proposed by <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kjamieson/hyperband.html">Jamieson</a>).</p>
<p>Those of you interested in code, my collaborator <a href="http://www.callowbird.com/">Yang Yuan</a> has promised to release it on GitHub, so please go ahead and email him <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>PS. We’re grateful to Sanjeev Arora for helpful discussions on this topic.</p>
<p>PPS. It has been a long time since my last post, and I still owe the readers an exposition on the data compression approach to unsupervised learning.  In the mean time, you may want to read this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01132">paper with Tengyu Ma</a> in NIPS 2016.</p></div></div>
