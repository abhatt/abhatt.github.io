intervals called a bar code. It is often said that the long intervals represent
the "topological signal" and the short intervals represent "noise". We give
evidence to dispute this thesis, showing that the short intervals encode
geometric information. Specifically, we show that persistent homology detects
the curvature of disks from which points have been sampled. We describe a
general computational framework for solving inverse problems using average
persistence landscapes. In the present application, the average persistence
landscapes of points sampled from disks of constant curvature produce a path in
a Hilbert space which may be learned.

(decision tree) for a function, we may find upper bounds on its quantum query
complexity. More precisely, they have shown that given a decision tree for a
function $f:\{0,1\}^n\to[m]$ whose input can be accessed via queries to its
bits, and a guessing algorithm that predicts answers to the queries, there is a
quantum query algorithm for $f$ which makes at most $O(\sqrt{GT})$ quantum
queries where $T$ is the depth of the decision tree and $G$ is the maximum
number of mistakes of the guessing algorithm. In this paper we give a simple
proof of and generalize this result for functions $f:[\ell]^n \to [m]$ with
non-binary input as well as output alphabets. Our main tool for this
generalization is non-binary span program which has recently been developed for
non-binary functions, as well as the dual adversary bound. As applications of
our main result we present several quantum query upper bounds, some of which
are new. In particular, we show that topological sorting of vertices of a
directed graph $\mathcal{G}$ can be done with $O(n^{3/2})$ quantum queries in
the adjacency matrix model. Also, we show that the quantum query complexity of
the maximum bipartite matching is upper bounded by $O(n^{3/4}\sqrt m + n)$ in
the adjacency list model.

to determine the partial order of events in highly distributed systems. The
bloom clock, like the vector clock, can autonomously detect causality
violations by comparing its logical timestamps. Unlike the vector clock, the
space complexity of the bloom clock does not depend on the number of nodes in a
system. Instead it depends on a set of chosen parameters that determine its
confidence interval, i.e. false positive rate. To reduce the space complexity
from which the vector clock suffers, the bloom clock uses a 'moving window' in
which the partial order of events can be inferred with high confidence. If two
clocks are not comparable, the bloom clock can always deduce it, i.e. false
negatives are not possible. If two clocks are comparable, the bloom clock can
calculate the confidence of that statement, i.e. it can compute the false
positive rate between comparable pairs of clocks. By choosing an acceptable
threshold for the false positive rate, the bloom clock can properly compare the
order of its timestamps, with that of other nodes in a highly accurate and
space efficient way.

improve software reliability and to speed up performance. Examples include a
Doubly Linked List which allows a faster deletion due to the presence of the
previous pointer. With the introduction of Persistent Memory, storing the
redundant data fields into persistent memory adds a significant write overhead,
and reduces performance. In this work, we focus on three data structures -
Doubly Linked List, B+Tree and Hashmap, and showcase alternate partly
persistent implementations where we only store a limited set of data fields to
persistent memory. After a crash/restart, we use the persistent data fields to
recreate the data structures along with the redundant data fields. We compare
our implementation with the base implementation and show that we achieve
speedups around 5-20% for some data structures, and up to 165% for a
flush-dominated data structure.

Nong (TOIS, 2013) that computes simultaneously the Lyndon array and the suffix

boolean circuits of super-linear size is a major frontier in complexity theory.
While such lower bounds are known for larger complexity classes, existing
results only show that the corresponding problems are hard on infinitely many
input lengths. For instance, proving almost-everywhere circuit lower bounds is
open even for problems in $\mathsf{MAEXP}$. Giving the notorious difficulty of
proving lower bounds that hold for all large input lengths, we ask the
following question: Can we show that a large set of techniques cannot prove
that $\mathsf{NP}$ is easy infinitely often? Motivated by this and related
questions about the interaction between mathematical proofs and computations,
we investigate circuit complexity from the perspective of logic.
</p>
<p>Among other results, we prove that for any parameter $k \geq 1$ it is
consistent with theory $T$ that computational class $\mathcal{C} \nsubseteq
\textit{i.o.}\mathsf{SIZE}(n^k)$, where $(T, \mathcal{C})$ is one of the pairs:
</p>
<p>$T = \mathsf{T}^1_2\;$ and $\;{\cal C} = \mathsf{P}^\mathsf{NP}$, $\quad T =
\mathsf{S}^1_2\;$ and $\;{\cal C} = \mathsf{NP}$, $\quad T = \mathsf{PV}\;$ and
$\;{\cal C} = \mathsf{P}$.
</p>
<p>In other words, these theories cannot establish infinitely often circuit
upper bounds for the corresponding problems. This is of interest because the
weaker theory $\mathsf{PV}$ already formalizes sophisticated arguments, such as
a proof of the PCP Theorem (Pich, 2015). These consistency statements are
unconditional and improve on earlier theorems of Krajicek and Oliveira (2017)
and Bydzovsky and Muller (2018) on the consistency of lower bounds with
$\mathsf{PV}$.

timestamps to detect the information source in a network. The problem incurs
prohibitive cost under canonical maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the
source due to the exponential number of possible infection paths. Our main idea
of source detection, however, is to approximate the MLE by an alternative
infection path based estimator, the essence of which is to identify the most
likely infection path that is consistent with observed timestamps. The source
node associated with that infection path is viewed as the estimated source
$\hat{v}$. We first study the case of tree topology, where by transforming the
infection path based estimator into a linear integer programming, we find a
reduced search region that remarkably improves the time efficiency.
</p>
<p>Within this reduced search region, the estimator $\hat{v}$ is provably always
on a path which we term as \emph{candidate path}. This notion enables us to
analyze the distribution of $d(v^{\ast},\hat{v})$, the error distance between
$\hat{v}$ and the true source $v^{\ast}$, on arbitrary tree, which allows us to
obtain for the first time, in the literature provable performance guarantee of
the estimator under limited timestamps. Specifically, on the infinite
$g$-regular tree with uniform sampled timestamps, we get a refined performance
guarantee in the sense of a constant bounded $d(v^{\ast},\hat{v})$. By virtue
of time labeled BFS tree, the estimator still performs fairly well when
extended to more general graphs. Experiments on both synthetic and real
datasets further demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed
algorithms.

shortest unique substring (SUS) for an interval [s, t] if (a) u occurs exactly
once in T, (b) u contains the interval [s, t] (i.e. i \leq s \leq t \leq j),

Additionally, we focus on the point SUS problem, which is the interval SUS

online bipartite matching problem where each edge has a probability of
"success". When a match is made it succeeds with the probability of the
corresponding edge. Introducing this model, Mehta and Panigrahi (FOCS 2012)
focused on the special case of identical and vanishingly small edge
probabilities and gave an online algorithm which is 0.567 competitive against a
deterministic offline LP. For the case of vanishingly small but heterogeneous
probabilities Mehta et al. (SODA 2015), gave a 0.534 competitive algorithm
against the same LP benchmark.
</p>
<p>We study a generalization of the problem to vertex-weighted graphs and
compare against clairvoyant algorithms that know the sequence of arrivals and
the edge probabilities in advance, but not the outcomes of potential matches.
To the best of our knowledge, no results beating $1/2$ were previously known
for this setting, even for identical probabilities. By introducing a novel
path-based formulation, we show that a natural variant of the RANKING algorithm
achieves the best possible competitive ratio of $(1-1/e)$, for heterogeneous
but vanishingly small edge probabilities. Our result also holds for
non-vanishing probabilities that decompose as a product of two factors, one
corresponding to each vertex of the edge. The idea of a path-based program may
be of independent interest in other online matching problems with a stochastic
component.

clustering cost but with the additional constraint that no color is
over-represented in any cluster. This problem is motivated by practical
clustering settings, e.g., in clustering news articles where the color of an
article is its source, it is preferable that no single news source dominates
any cluster.
</p>
<p>For the most general version of this problem, we obtain an algorithm that has
provable guarantees of performance; our algorithm is based on finding a
fractional solution using a linear program and rounding the solution
subsequently. For the special case of the problem where no color has an
absolute majority in any cluster, we obtain a simpler combinatorial algorithm
also with provable guarantees. Experiments on real-world data shows that our
algorithms are effective in finding good clustering without
over-representation.

essential information about the inputs and outputs of the network and can be
used to quickly identify key components and summary statistics of the inputs.
Furthermore, the sketch is recursive and can be unrolled to identify
sub-components of these components and so forth, capturing a potentially
complicated DAG structure. These sketches erase gracefully; even if we erase a
fraction of the sketch at random, the remainder still retains the `high-weight'
information present in the original sketch. The sketches can also be organized
in a repository to implicitly form a `knowledge graph'; it is possible to
quickly retrieve sketches in the repository that are related to a sketch of
interest; arranged in this fashion, the sketches can also be used to learn
emerging concepts by looking for new clusters in sketch space. Finally, in the
scenario where we want to learn a ground truth deep network, we show that
augmenting input/output pairs with these sketches can theoretically make it
easier to do so.

Giving the notorious difficulty of proving lower bounds that hold for all large input lengths, we ask the following question: 

Can we show that a large set of techniques cannot prove that NP is easy infinitely often? 

Motivated by this and related questions about the interaction between mathematical proofs and computations, we investigate circuit complexity from the perspective of logic.

  Among other results, we prove that for any parameter $k \geq 1$ it is consistent with theory $T$ that computational class $C$ is not contained infinitely often in SIZE$(n^k)$, where $(T, C)$ is one of the pairs:

  $T = T^1_2\;$ and $\;C = P^{NP}$, $\quad T = S^1_2\;$ and $\;C = NP$, $\quad T =~ $PV$\;$ and $C = P$.

  In other words, these theories cannot establish infinitely often circuit upper bounds for the corresponding problems. This is of interest because the weaker theory PV already formalizes sophisticated arguments, such as a proof of the PCP Theorem (Pich, 2015). These consistency statements are unconditional and improve on earlier theorems of Krajicek and Oliveira (2017) and Bydzovsky and Muller (2018) on the consistency of lower bounds with PV.</div>

Apparently, it’s a busy life being an assistant prof so there were no posts here all year. However, while some of us are decompressing after the NeurIPS deadline, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Oegc0quwv2PqoR_pzZlUIrPw4rFsZ4FKoKkUvmLBTHM/edit?usp=sharing">here is a link</a> to a crowdsourced spreadsheet created to collect information about theory jobs this year. 
Congratulations to both job seekers and departments/labs who are done with their searches!</p>

<p>In the past my academic uncle Lance Fortnow set this spreadsheet up (check <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/06/theory-jobs-2016.html">this link</a> to his post from two years ago which also has links to all the previous years). This year the first entry is Lance himself who is moving back to Chicago to be the Dean of the College of Science at the Illinois Institute of Technology. Did Lance get the idea from his advisor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Sipser">Michael Sipser</a> who is also a Dean of Science but at MIT? In any case, great to see theoretical computer scientists stepping up to be the deans of science, congratulations!</p>

<p>Rules about the spreadsheet have been copied from last years and all edits to the document are anonymized. Please, post a comment if you have any suggestions about the rules.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Separate sheets for faculty, industry and postdocs/visitors. </li>
 <li>People should be connected to theoretical computer science, broadly defined.</li>
 <li>Only add jobs that you are absolutely sure have been offered and accepted. This is not the place for speculation and rumors. </li>
 <li>You are welcome to add yourself, or people your department has hired. </li>
</ul>

<p>This document will continue to grow as more jobs settle.</p>

find a minimum subset of stations such that each connection runs through a
selected station. Although this problem is NP-hard in general, real-world
instances are regularly solved almost completely by a set of simple reduction
rules. To explain this behavior, we view transportation networks as hitting set
instances and identify two characteristic properties, locality and
heterogeneity. We then devise a randomized model to generate hitting set
instances with adjustable properties. While the heterogeneity does influence
the effectiveness of the reduction rules, the generated instances show that
locality is the significant factor. Beyond that, we prove that the
effectiveness of the reduction rules is independent of the underlying graph
structure. Finally, we show that high locality is also prevalent in instances
from other domains, facilitating a fast computation of minimum hitting sets.

that many problems that are NP-hard in general are polynomial-time solvable for

extracting useful information from large datasets. In many cases the challenge
is to discover a low-dimensional structure in the data, often concealed by the
existence of nuisance parameters and noise. Motivated by such challenges, we
consider the problem of estimating a signal from its scaled, cyclically-shifted
and noisy observations. We focus on the particularly challenging regime of low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), where different observations cannot be
shift-aligned. We show that an accurate estimation of the signal from its noisy
observations is possible, and derive a procedure which is proved to
consistently estimate the signal. The asymptotic sample complexity (the number
of observations required to recover the signal) of the procedure is
$1/\operatorname{SNR}^4$. Additionally, we propose a procedure which is
experimentally shown to improve the sample complexity by a factor equal to the
signal's length. Finally, we present numerical experiments which demonstrate
the performance of our algorithms, and corroborate our theoretical findings.

connection cost of the agents plus the total moving cost of the facilities,
over all stages. $K$-facility reallocation was introduced by de Keijzer and
Wojtczak, where they mostly focused on the special case of a single facility.
Using an LP-based approach, we present a polynomial time algorithm that
computes the optimal solution for any number of facilities. We also consider
online $K$-facility reallocation, where the algorithm becomes aware of agent
locations in a stage-by-stage fashion. By exploiting an interesting connection
to the classical $K$-server problem, we present a constant-competitive
algorithm for $K = 2$ facilities.

centers. This technology allows a process to directly read and write the memory
of a remote host, with a mechanism to control access permissions. In this
paper, we study the fundamental power of these capabilities. We consider the
well-known problem of achieving consensus despite failures, and find that RDMA
can improve the inherent trade-off in distributed computing between failure
resilience and performance. Specifically, we show that RDMA allows algorithms
that simultaneously achieve high resilience and high performance, while
traditional algorithms had to choose one or another. With Byzantine failures,
we give an algorithm that only requires $n \geq 2f_P + 1$ processes (where
$f_P$ is the maximum number of faulty processes) and decides in two (network)
delays in common executions. With crash failures, we give an algorithm that
only requires $n \geq f_P + 1$ processes and also decides in two delays. Both
algorithms tolerate a minority of memory failures inherent to RDMA, and they
provide safety in asynchronous systems and liveness with standard additional
assumptions.

distributions due to its many useful theoretical properties. However, solving
optimal transport exactly can be prohibitively expensive. Therefore, there has
been significant effort towards the design of scalable approximation
algorithms. Previous combinatorial results [Sharathkumar, Agarwal STOC '12,
Agarwal, Sharathkumar STOC '14] have focused primarily on the design of
strongly polynomial multiplicative approximation algorithms. There has also
been an effort to design approximate solutions with additive errors [Cuturi
NIPS '13, Altschuler et. al NIPS '17, Dvurechensky et al., ICML '18, Quanrud,
SOSA '19] within a time bound that is linear in the size of the cost matrix and
polynomial in $C/\delta$; here $C$ is the largest value in the cost matrix and
$\delta$ is the additive error. We present an adaptation of the classical graph
algorithm of Gabow and Tarjan and provide a novel analysis of this algorithm
that bounds its execution time by $O(\frac{n^2 C}{\delta}+
\frac{nC^2}{\delta^2})$. Our algorithm is extremely simple and executes, for an
arbitrarily small constant $\varepsilon$, only $\lfloor
\frac{2C}{(1-\varepsilon)\delta}\rfloor + 1$ iterations, where each iteration
consists only of a Dijkstra search followed by a depth-first search. We also
provide empirical results that suggest our algorithm significantly outperforms
existing approaches in execution time.

The government shut down in January led to delays at the National Science Foundation and only recently announcing decisions on grants submitted last fall. For those who successfully received awards, congratulations! For those who didn't, don't take it personally, buckle up and try again.<br />
<br />
For those who don't know how the process works, for each grant program, the program directors organize one or more panels which typically meets in person at NSF headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia. A typical panel has about a dozen panelists and twenty or so proposals. Before the panels, each proposal gets at least three reviews by the panelists. Discussions ensue over a day or two, proposals get sorted into categories: Highly Competitive, Competitive, Low Competitive and Not Competitive and then ranked ordered in the top categories.<br />
<br />
There are tight rules for Conflict-of-Interest and those who are conflicted have to leave the room during the discussions on those papers.<br />
<br />
If you do get asked to serve on a panel, you should definitely do so. You get to see how the process works and help influence funding and research directions in your field. You can't reveal when you serve on a particular panel but you can say "Served on NSF Panels" on your CV.<br />
<br />
Panels tend to take proposals that will likely make progress and not take ones less risky. Funding risky proposals is specifically mentioned to the panel but when push comes to shove and there is less funding than worthy proposals, panelists gravitate towards proposals that don't take chances.<br />
<br />
Panels are not unlike conference program committees. It didn't always work this way, it used to be more like journal publications. I remember when the program director would send out proposals for outside reviews and then make funding decisions. That gave the program director more discretion to fund a wider variety of proposals.<br />
<br />
The NSF budget for computing goes up slowly while the number of academic computer scientists grows at a much larger clip. Until this changes, we'll have more and more worthy proposals unfunded, particularly proposals of bold risky projects. That's the saddest part of all.</div>

<div class="content">
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-large;"><u>Individual Notions of Fairness You Can Use</u></span></div><br />Our group at Penn has been thinking about when <i>individual </i>notions of fairness might be practically achievable for awhile, and we have <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10660">two</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10607">new</a> approaches.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><u>Background</u>:</span><br /><u>Statistical Fairness</u><br />I've written about this before, <a href="http://aaronsadventures.blogspot.com/2017/11/between-statistical-and-individual.html">here</a>. But briefly: there are two families of definitions in the fairness in machine learning literature. The first group of definitions, which I call <i>statistical</i> fairness notions, is far and away the most popular. If you want to come up with your own statistical fairness notion, you can follow this recipe:<br /><ol><li>Partition the world into a small number of "protected sub-groups". You will probably be thinking along the lines of race or gender or something similar when you do this.</li><li>Pick your favorite error/accuracy metric for a classifier. This might literally be classification error, or false positive or false negative rate, or positive predictive value, or something else. Lots of options here. </li><li>Ask that this metric be approximately equalized across your protected groups.</li><li>Finally, enjoy your new statistical fairness measure! Congratulations!</li></ol><div>These definitions are far and away the most popular in this literature, in large part (I think) because they are so immediately actionable. Because they are defined as conditions on a small number of expectations, you can easily check whether your classifier is "fair" according to these metrics, and (although there are some interesting computational challenges) go and try and learn classifiers subject to these constraints. </div><div><br /></div><div>Their major problem is related to the reason for their success: they are defined as conditions on a small number of expectations or <i>averages</i> over people, and so they don't promise much to particular individuals. I'll borrow an example from our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05144">fairness gerrymandering</a> paper from a few years ago to put this in sharp relief. Imagine that we are building a system to decide who to incarcerate, and we want to be "fair" with respect to both gender (men and women) and race (green and blue people). We decide that in our scenario, it is the false positives who are harmed (innocent people sent to jail), and so to be fair, we decide should equalize the false positive rate: across men and women, and across greens and blues. But one way to do this is to jail all green men and blue women. This does indeed equalize the false positive rate (at 50%) across all four of the groups we specified, but is cold comfort if you happen to be a green man --- since then you will be jailed with certainty. The problem was our fairness constraint was never a promise to an individual to begin with, just a promise about the average behavior of our classifier over a large group. And although this is a toy example constructed to make a point, things like this happen in real data too. </div><br /><u>Individual Fairness</u><br />Individual notions of fairness, on the other hand, really do correspond to promises made to individuals. There are at least two kinds of individual fairness definitions that have been proposed: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2090255">metric fairness</a>, and <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6355-fairness-in-learning-classic-and-contextual-bandits">weakly meritocratic fairness</a>. Metric fairness proposes that the learner will be handed a <i>task specific similarity metric</i>, and requires that individuals who are close together in the metric should have a similar probability of being classified as positive. Weakly meritocratic fairness, on the other hand, takes the (unknown) labels of an individual as a measure of merit, and requires that individuals who have a higher probability of really having a positive label should have only a higher probability of being classified as positive. This in particular implies that false positive and false negative rates should be equalized <i>across individuals</i>, where now the word <i>rate</i> is averaging over only the randomness of the classifier, not over people. What makes both of these <i>individual</i> notions of fairness is that they impose constraints that bind on all pairs of individuals and not just over averages of people.<br /><br />Definitions like this have the advantage of strong individual-level semantics, which the statistical definitions don't have. But they also have big problems: for metric fairness, the obvious question is: <i>where does the metric come from</i>? Even granting that fairness should be some Lipschitz condition on a metric, it seems hard to pin down what the metric is, and different people will disagree: coming up with the metric seems to encapsulate a large part of the original problem of defining fairness. For weakly meritocratic fairness, the obvious problem is that we don't know what the labels are. Its possible to do non-trivial things if you make assumptions about the label generating process, but its not at all clear you can do any non-trivial learning subject to this constraint if you don't make strong assumptions.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><u>Two New Approaches:</u></span><br />We have two new approaches, building off of metric fairness and weakly meritocratic fairness respectively. Both have the advantages of statistical notions of fairness in that they can be put into practice without making unrealistic assumptions about the data, and without needing to wait on someone to hand us a metric. But they continue to make meaningful promises to individuals.<br /><br /><u>Subjective Individual Fairness</u><br />Lets start with our variant of metric fairness, which we call subjective individual fairness. (This is joint work with Michael Kearns, our PhD students Chris Jung and Seth Neel, our former PhD student Steven Wu, and Steven's student (our grand student!) Logan Stapleton). The paper is here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10660">https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10660</a>. We stick with the premise that "similar people should be treated similarly", and that whether or not it is correct/just/etc., it is at least fair to treat two people the same way, in the sense that we classify them as positive with the same probability. But we don't want to assume anything else.<br /><br />Suppose I were to create a machine learning fairness panel: I could recruit "AI Ethics" experts, moral philosophers, hyped up consultants, people off the street, toddlers, etc. I would expect that there would be as many different conceptions of fairness as there were people on the panel, and that none of them could precisely quantify what they meant by fairness --- certainly not in the form of a "fairness metric". But I could still ask these people, in particular cases, if they thought it was fair that two particular individuals be treated differently or not.<br /><br />Of course, I would have no reason to expect that the responses that I got from the different panelists would be consistent with one another --- or possibly even internally consistent (we won't assume, e.g. that the responses satisfy any kind of triangle inequality). Nevertheless, once we fix a data distribution and a group of people who have opinions about fairness, we have a well defined tradeoff we can hope to manage: any classifier we could choose will have both:<br /><ol><li>Some error rate, and</li><li>Some frequency with which it makes a pair of decisions that someone in the group finds unfair. </li></ol><div>We can hope to find classifiers that optimally trade off 1 and 2: note this is a coherent tradeoff even though we haven't forced the people to try and express their conceptions of fairness into some consistent metric. What we show is that you can do this. </div><div><br /></div><div>Specifically, given a set of pairs that we have determined should be treated similarly, there is an <i>oracle efficient </i>algorithm that can find the optimal classifier subject to the constraint that no pair of individuals that has been specified as a constraint should have a substantially different probability of positive classification. Oracle efficiency means that what we can do is reduce the "fair learning" problem to a regular old learning problem, without fairness constraints. If we can solve the regular learning problem, we can also solve the fair learning problem. This kind of fairness constraint also generalizes in the standard way: if you ask your fairness panel about a reasonably small number of pairs, and then solve the in-sample problem subject to these constraints, the classifier you learn will also satisfy the fairness constraints out of sample. And it works: we implement the algorithm and try it out on the COMPAS data set, with fairness constraints that we elicited from 43 human (undergrad) subjects. The interesting thing is that once you have an algorithm like this, it isn't only a tool to create "fair" machine learning models: its also a new instrument to investigate human conceptions of fairness. We already see quite a bit of variation among our 43 subjects in our preliminary experiments. We plan to pursue this direction more going forward.</div><div><br /></div><div><u>Average Individual Fairness</u></div><div>Next, our variant of weakly meritocratic fairness. This is joint work with Michael Kearns and our student Saeed Sharifi. The paper is here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10607">https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10607</a>. In certain scenarios, it really does seem tempting to think about fairness in terms of false positive rates. Criminal justice is a great example, in the sense that it is clear that everyone agrees on which outcome they <i>want</i> (they would like to be released from jail), and so the people we are being unfair to really do seem to be the false positives: the people who should have been released from jail, but who were mistakenly incarcerated for longer. So in our "fairness gerrymandering" example above, maybe the problem with thinking about false positive rates wasn't a problem with <i>false positives</i>, but with <i>rates</i>: i.e. the problem was that the word rate averaged over many people, and so it didn't promise <i>you</i> anything. Our idea is to redefine the word rate. </div><div><br /></div><div>In some (but certainly not all) settings, people are subject to not just one, but many classification tasks. For example, consider online advertising: you might be shown thousands of targeted ads each month. Or applying for schools (a process that is centralized in cities like New York): you apply not just to one school, but to many. In situations like this, we can model the fact that we have not just a distribution over people, but also a distribution over (or collection of) problems. </div><div><br /></div><div>Once we have a distribution over problems, we can define the error rate, or false positive rate, or any other rate you like <i>for individuals. </i>It is now sensible to talk about Alice's false positive rate, or Bob's error rate, because rate has been redefined as an average over problems, for a particular individual. So we can now ask for individual fairness notions in the spirit of the statistical notions of fairness we discussed above! We no longer need to define protected groups: we can now ask that the false positive rates, or error rates, be equalized across all pairs of people. </div><div><br /></div><div>It turns out that given a reasonably sized sample of people, and a reasonably sized sample of problems, it is tractable to find the optimal classifier subject to constraints like this in sample, and that these guarantees generalize out of sample. The in-sample algorithm is again an oracle-efficient algorithm, or in other words, a reduction to standard, unconstrained learning. The generalization guarantee here is a little interesting, because now we are talking about simultaneous generalization in two different directions: to people we haven't seen before, and also to problems we haven't seen before. This requires thinking a little bit about what kind of object we are even trying to output: a mapping from new problems to classifiers. The details are in the paper (spoiler --- the mapping is defined by the optimal dual variables for the empirical risk minimization problem): here, I'll just point out that again, the algorithm is practical to implement, and we perform some simple experiments with it. </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><br /><br /><br /></div>

<p>An inadequately-explained phenomenon in computational complexity theory is that there are so few natural candidates for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-intermediate">-intermediate problems</a>, problems in  but neither in  nor -complete. Of course, if  there are none, and the <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/05/27/Schaefer's dichotomy theorem">dichotomy theorem</a> implies that there are no intermediate Boolean constraint satisfaction problems. But there are a lot of other types of problems in , and a theorem of Ladner<sup id="fnref:l"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/05/27/shattering-quasipolynomiality.html#fn:l" class="footnote">1</a></sup> shows that there should be an infinite hierarchy of degrees of hardness within . So where are all the members of this hierarchy, and why are they so shy?</p>

<p>The same thing happens not just for  but for other related complexity classes like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%99%AFP"></a>. There should be many -intermediate classes but we know even fewer than for . <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/102118180704402052">I recently posted</a> about a discussion I had with Igor Pak on this issue, in which we suggested to each other two number-theoretic candidates for being -intermediate, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function">Euler totient function</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime-counting_function">prime-counting function</a> (see also <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/43954/95">Igor’s StackExchange question on this</a>). But although they’re in , neither of these functions is very combinatorial.</p>

<p>So anyway, the point of all this is to discuss more candidates for being -intermediate that are, I think, natural and combinatorial. They’re part of a family of problems that include a couple of related candidates for being -intermediate, and even a candidate for being -intermediate. These problems come from computational learning theory, or alternatively they can be seen as coming from mathematical logic, hereditary graph theory, and the theory of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rado_graph">Rado graph</a>. And they’re all at what is in some sense the shallow end of the intermediate problems: they’re solvable in quasi-polynomial time, meaning , but not known to be solvable in polynomial time. So this is pretty strong evidence that they’re not complete for their respective complexity classes, but weaker evidence than usual that they’re not polynomial.</p>

<p>In learning theory, a family of sets  is said to <em>shatter</em> another set  (not necessarily belonging to ) if every subset of , including the empty set and  itself, can be obtained by intersecting  with some member of . The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapnik%E2%80%93Chervonenkis_dimension">Vapnik–Chervonenkis dimension</a> of  is just the size of the largest set that is shattered by  . If we let  (the number of sets in the family) and  (the number of distinct elements in those sets), then the dimension is clearly at most , because sets of size larger than  have too many subsets for them all to be formed by intersection with a member of . Therefore, the following problem can be solved in quasipolynomial time, by a brute-force search of the  small-enough subsets of :<sup id="fnref:lmr"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/05/27/shattering-quasipolynomiality.html#fn:lmr" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<dl>
  <dt>VC-dimension (largest shattered set)</dt>
  <dd>Input: family of sets , number 

    <p>Output: true if  shatters a set of size , false otherwise.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>The same quasipolynomial time bound applies to the following related problems,
the first of which is also in  and the second of which is in :</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Smallest non-shattered set</dt>
  <dd>Input: family of sets , number 

    <p>Output: True if there exists a subset  of 
of size  that is not shattered by , false otherwise.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Number of shattered sets</dt>
  <dd>Input: family of sets 

    <p>Output: the number of sets shattered by .</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>For the first two problems, being non--complete hinges on the assumption that , but for the number of shattered sets, being non--complete (under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial-time_counting_reduction">counting reductions</a>) is unconditional: the output doesn’t provide enough bits of information to encode the answers to all other  problems.
The VC-dimension is hard to approximate under a form of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_time_hypothesis">exponential time hypothesis</a>, strongly suggesting that it cannot be computed exactly in polynomial time.<sup id="fnref:mr"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/05/27/shattering-quasipolynomiality.html#fn:mr" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>To see that the two existence problems can sometimes both have answers that are logarithmic, it’s helpful to turn to the theory of random graphs, and of <em>the</em> random graph, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rado_graph">Rado graph</a>. This graph obeys a collection of <em>extension axioms</em> according to which, for every two disjoint finite subsets of vertices, there exists another vertex adjacent to everything in the first subset and to nothing in the second subset. Using these axioms, we can build up induced copies of any finite or countable subgraph, one vertex at a time, using a greedy algorithm. Based on this property, let’s define a subset  of the vertices in an undirected graph to be <em>extensible</em> if, for every partition of  into two disjoint subsets, there exists another vertex outside  that is adjacent to everything in the first subset and to nothing in the second subset. This is nothing more than being shattered by the neighborhoods of the vertices outside . So we have the following corresponding problems.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Largest extensible set</dt>
  <dd>Input: Undirected graph , number 

    <p>Output: true if  has an extensible set of size , false otherwise.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Smallest non-extensible set</dt>
  <dd>Input: Undirected graph , number 

    <p>Output: true if  has a non-extensible set of size , false otherwise.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Smallest missing induced subgraph</dt>
  <dd>Input: Undirected graph , number 

    <p>Output: true if there is a graph  on at most  vertices that
is not an induced subgraph of , false otherwise.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Number of extensible sets</dt>
  <dd>Input: Undirected graph 

    <p>Output: The number of extensible sets of vertices of .</p>
  </dd>

<p>The smallest missing induced subgraph size naturally falls into the complexity class  of problems for which you can guess a solution (the missing subgraph) but then verifying it involves solving a co- problem (is this subgraph missing).
It is greater than the size of the smallest non-extensible set, because if you try to build up a given induced subgraph by adding one vertex at a time greedily you can only get stuck at a non-extensible set. There must be a missing induced subgraph of size at most , because there are  isomorphism classes of -vertex labeled graphs and fewer than  ways of choosing which of the  labeled vertices correspond to vertices of , so for larger values of  than this bound there are more labeled graphs than placements of them as induced subgraphs. Another way of thinking about the smallest missing induced subgraph problem is that we are asking for the largest  for which  is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_graph">-universal</a>: it contains all graphs on at most  vertices as induced subgraphs.</p>

<p>The smallest non-extensible set and the smallest missing subgraph are both easy on any hereditary class of graphs, because these classes always have a missing subgraph of size . On the other hand, if  is chosen uniformly at random among the -vertex graphs, then any small subset of its vertices is extensible with high probability, so the smallest non-extensible set has expected size .</p>

<p>If these problems are not - and -complete, what are they? Papadimitriou and Yannakakis<sup id="fnref:py"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/05/27/shattering-quasipolynomiality.html#fn:py" class="footnote">4</a></sup> define a complexity class , and show that VC-dimension is -complete. Presumably, because it’s so similar, the same is true for the largest extensible set. Maybe it’s possible to prove completeness for the smallest missing induced subgraph in an analogue of  at the level of , and to prove completeness for the number of shattered sets and number of extensible sets in an analogue of  at this level.</p>

On the excellent TV show Veep there was a subplot about a political candidate (who himself had failed algebra in HS) objecting to Algebra since it was invented by the Muslims. I don't recall the exact line, but he said something like `Math teachers are terrorists'<br />
This was, of course, fiction.<br />
<br />
The same week I read that 56% of survey respondents say `<u><i>Arabic Numerals' shouldn't be taught in</i></u> <i><u>schools'</u></i> Obviously also a fiction. Perhaps a headline from <i>The Onion</i>.<br />
<br />
No. The story is true.<br />
<br />
See snopes entry on this: <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/teaching-arabic-numerals/">here</a><br />
<br />
but also see many FALSE but FUNNY websites:<br />
<br />
Sarah Palin wants Arabic Numerals out of the schools: <a href="http://nationalreport.net/sarah-palin-wants-arabic-numerals-banned-americas-schools/">here</a> Funny but false.<br />
<br />
Jerry Brown is forcing students in California to learn Arabic Numerals as part of multi-culturism False by funny:  <a href="https://me.me/i/sharia-law-must-be-stopped-under-gov-brown-students-in-20990368">here</a><br />
<br />
A website urging us to use Roman Numerals (which Jesus used!) False but funny:  <a href="http://freedomnumerals.com/">here</a><br />
<br />
OKAY, what to make of the truth that really, really, 56% of Americans are against Arab Numerals<br />
<br />
1) Bigotry combined with ignorance.<br />
<br />
2) Some of the articles I read about this say its a problem with polls and people. There may be some of that, but still worries me.<br />
<br />
3) In Nazi Germany (WOW- Goodwin's law popped up rather early!) they stopped teaching relativity because Albert Einstein was Jewish (the story is more complicated than that, see <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-2-pro-nazi-nobelists-attacked-einstein-s-jewish-science-excerpt1/">her</a>e). That could of course never happen in America now (or could it, see <a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/50097/time-warp">here</a> and <a href="https://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Counterexamples_to_Relativity">here</a>).<br />
<br />
4) There is no danger that we will dump Arabic Numerals. I wonder if we will change there name to Freedom Numerals.<br />
<br />
5) Ignorance of science is a more immediate problem with the anti-vax people. See <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/measles-outbreak-grows-with-60-new-cases-across-26-states?ref=home">here</a><br />

Gabbay </a>and <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~amp12/">Andrew M.

You can find the transcript of the interview below. My questions are labelled with <b>LA</b>, Andy's answers with <b>AP</b> and Jamie's with <b>JG</b>. I hope that you'll enjoy reading their insights and the story of their award-receiving work as much as I did myself. <br /><br /><div dir="ltr"><b>LA: </b>You are receiving the 2019 Alonzo Church Award  for  Outstanding Contributions to Logic and Computation as well as the  Test-of-Time Award from LICS 1999 for your invention of nominal  techniques to provide a semantic understanding of abstract syntax with  binding.   Could you briefly describe the history of the ideas that led  you to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_model">permutation model of set theory with atoms</a> due to  Fraenkel and Mostowski to represent name abstraction and fresh name  generation? What were the  main inspirations and motivations for your work? In your opinion, how  did nominal techniques advance the state of the art at that time?</div><div dir="ltr"></div><br /><div dir="ltr"><b>AP: </b>I have had a long-standing interest in the mathematical semantics of programming language features that restrict resources to a specific scope, or hide information from a program's environment; think local mutable state in languages like <a href="http://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, or channel-name restriction in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A0-calculus">pi-calculus</a>. When <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/stark/">Ian Stark</a> was doing his PhD with me in the 90s we tried to understand a simple instance: the observable properties of higher-order functions combined with dynamically generated atomic names that can be tested for equality, but don't have any other attribute -- we called this the "nu-calculus". Ian gave a denotational semantics for the nu-calculus using Moggi's monad for modelling dynamic allocation. That monad is defined on the category of pullback-preserving functors from the category of injective functions between finite ordinals to the category of sets. This functor category was well-known to me from topos theory, where it is called <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Schanuel+topos">Schanuel's topos </a>and hosts the generic model of a geometric theory of an infinite decidable set.  A few years later, when Jamie joined me as a PhD student in 1998, I suggested we look at the Schanuel topos as a setting for initial algebra semantics of syntax involving binding operations, modulo alpha-equivalence. I think Jamie prefers set theory over category theory, so he pushed us to use another known equivalent presentation of the Schanuel topos, in terms of continuous actions of the group of permutations of the set N of natural numbers (topologized as a subspace of the product of countably many copies of N). In this form there is an obvious connection with the cumulative hierarchy of sets (with atoms) that are hereditarily finitely supported with respect to the action of permuting atoms. This universe of sets was devised by Fraenkel and Mostowski in the first part of the twentieth century to model ZFA set theory without axioms of choice.  Whether one emphasises set theory or category theory, the move to making permutations of names, rather than injections between sets of names, the primary concept was very fruitful. For example, it certainly makes higher-order constructions (functions and powersets) in the topos/set-theory easier to describe and use. We ended up with a generic construction for name-abstraction modulo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Alpha_equivalence">alpha-equivalence</a> compatible with classical higher-order logic or set theory, so long as one abstains from unrestricted use of choice. </div><div dir="ltr"></div><div dir="ltr"><br /><b>JG:</b> At the time it wasn't an idea to consider names as elements of a distinctive datatype of names, with properties just like other datatypes such as the natural numbers Nat. If we want to add 1 to 1, we take 1:Nat and invoke the "plus" function, which is a specific thing associated to Nat; so why not abstract a in x by assuming a:Atm (where Atm is a distinct thing in our mathematical universe) and x:X and invoking a function "abstract", which is a thing associated to Atm?  We unfolded the implications of this idea in set theory and rediscovered FM sets.  I was inspired by the way I saw mathematics built up in ZF set theory as an undergraduate, starting from a simple basis and building up the cumulative hierarchy.  When I saw the chance to do this for a universe with names, I jumped at the chance.  It turns out FM sets are not required.  Nominal techniques can be built in ZFA set theory, which contains more functions and permits unrestricted choice. </div><div dir="ltr"><br /><b>LA: </b>Over  the last fifteen years, nominal techniques have become a fundamental  tool for modelling locality in computation, underlying research  presented in over a hundred papers, new programming languages and models  of computation. They have applications to the syntax and semantics of  programming languages, to logics for machine-assisted reasoning about  programming-language semantics and to the automatic verification of  specifications in process calculi. Variations on nominal sets are used  in automata theory over infinite alphabets, with applications to  querying XML and databases, and also feature in work on models of  Homotopy Type Theory. When did it dawn on you that you had succeeded in  finding a very good model for name abstraction and fresh name  generation, and one that would have a  lot of impact? Did you imagine that your model would generate such a  large amount of follow-up work, leading to a whole body of work on  nominal computation theory? <br /><br /><b>AP: </b>No, to begin with I was very focussed on getting better techniques for computing and reasoning about syntax with bound names. But that only represents a part of the current broad landscape of nominal techniques, the part that mainly depends on the mathematical notion of "finite support" (a way of expressing, via name-permutation, that an object only involves finitely many names). Independently of us, some people realised that a related notion of finiteness, "orbit-finiteness" (which expresses that an object is finite modulo symmetries) is crucial for many applications of nominal techniques. I am referring to the work of Montanari and Pistore on pi-calculus and <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82414059.pdf">HD automata </a>using named sets (yet another equivalent of the Schanuel topos) and the work on automata theory over infinite alphabets (and much else besides) using "sets with atoms" by the Warsaw group (Bojanczyk, Klin, Lasota, Torunczyk,...). The latter is particularly significant because it considers groups of symmetry for atoms other than the full permutation group (in which the only property of an atom preserved under symmetry is its identity). <br /><br /><b>JG:</b> Yes, I did.  Nobody could anticipate the specific applications but I knew we were on to something, which is why I stayed on to build the field after the PhD.  The amount of structure was just too striking.  This showed early: e.g. in the equivariance properties, and the commutation of nominal atoms-abstraction with function-spaces.  When I sent the proof of this property to Andrew, at first he didn't believe it!  I had a sense that there was something deep going on and I still do. <br /><br /><b>LA: </b>What is the result of  yours on nominal techniques you are most proud of? And what are your  favourite results amongst those achieved by others on nominal computation?<b></b><br /><b><br /></b><b>AP:</b> Not so much a specific result, but rather a logical concept, the freshness quantifier (which we wrote using an upside down "N" -- N stands for "New"). In informal practice when reasoning about syntax involving binders, one often chooses <i>some</i> fresh name for the bound variable, but then has to revise that choice in view of later ones; but fortunately <i>any </i>fresh name does as well as some particular one. This distinctive "some/any" property occurs all over the place when computing and reasoning about languages with binders and the freshness quantifier formalises it, in terms of the freshness ("not in the support of") relation and conventional quantifiers.  For the second part of your question I would choose two things. One is the work by Jamie with Fernandez and Mackie on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540106001635">nominalrewriting systems</a>, which won the PPDP Most Influential Paper 10-year Award in 2014. The second is the characterisation of orbit-finite sets with atoms in terms of "set-builder expressions"---see Klin et al, "<a href="https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~szymtor/papers/locfin.pdf">Locally Finite Constraint Satisfaction Problems</a>", Proc. LICS 2015); it's a nice application of the classical model theory of homogeneous structures with interesting applications for languages that compute with finite structures. <br /><br /><b>JG:</b> Thanks for asking.  Aside from the initial papers, my work on nominal rewriting with Fernandez has probably had most impact.  However, I am rather fond of the thread of research going from Nominal Algebra, through the axiomatisation of substitution and first-order logic and the characterisation of quantification as a limit in nominal sets, and on to Stone duality.  It's a mathematical foundation built from a nominal perspective of naming and quantification and I hope that as the state of the art in nominal techniques advances and broadens, it might prove useful.  Andrew's book has been helpful in marking out nominal techniques as a field.  I also agree with Andrew that orbit-finiteness and the applications of this idea to transition systems and automata, is important.  I like the automata work for another concrete reason: nominal techniques were discovered in the context of names and binding in syntax, which has bequeathed a misconception that nominal techniques are <i>only</i> about this.  The Warsaw school of nominal techniques gives an independent illustration of the other applications of these ideas. <br /><b><br /></b><b><b>LA: </b></b>Twenty years have passed since your LICS 1999 paper and the  literature on variations on nominal techniques now contains over a hundred papers. Do you expect any further  development related to the theory and application of nominal techniques in the  coming years? What advice would you give to a PhD student who is  interested in working on topics related to nominal computation today?</div><div dir="ltr"><br /><b>AP: </b> For the purpose of answering your question, let's agree to divide LICS topics into Programming Languages and Semantics (PLS) versus Logic and Algorithms (LAS). (So long as we don't think of it as a dichotomy!) Then it seems to me that applications of nominal techniques to LAS are currently in the ascendant and show no sign of slowing down. My own interests are with PLS and there is still work to be done there. In particular, I would like better support for using nominal techniques within the mainstream interactive theorem proving systems: we have the Nominal Package of Urban and Berghofer for classical higher-order logic within Isabelle (which lead to Urban and Tasson winning the CADE Skolem Award in 2015), but nothing analogous for systems based on dependent type theory, such as Agda, Coq and Lean. Recent work of Swan (arXiv:1702.01556) gives us a better understanding of how to develop nominal sets within constructive logic; but I have yet to see a dependent type theory that both corresponds to some form of constructive nominal logic under Curry-Howard and is sufficiently simple that it appeals to users of systems lke Coq who want to mechanise programming language meta-theory in a nameful style. Really, I would like the utility of the FreshML programming language that Jamie, Mark Shinwell and I proposed in 2003 (and which Mark implemented as a patch of OCaml) restricted to total functional programming in the style of Agda; but I don't quite know how to achieve that. <br /><br /><b>JG:</b> Yes.  We are far from understanding nominal techniques and the field has a lot of life and will continue to surprise.  I've always believed that.  A key sticking-point right now is implementations.  I wrote a paper about this recently, on equivariance and the foundations of nominal techniques.  One point in the paper is a sketch for a next-generation nominal theorem-prover (based on ZFA + equivariance).  I'd like to see this carried out, so if anybody reading this is interested then please be in touch.  I'd also like to see nominal techniques implemented as a package in a language like Haskell, ML, or even Python!  If we can get this stuff into the working programmer's toolbox, in a way that just works and does not require special configuration, then that would be helpful.  I suspect that nominal techniques as currently presented in the maths papers, might not fit into a programming language at the moment.  The theory is too strong and may need weakened first.  We need a subset of nominal techniques weak enough to squeeze into an existing language, yet expressive enough for interesting applications.  Some general advice, specifically for the PhD student.  If you have an idea which most people around you don't understand, consider this may be a gap in the collective imagination.  There can be peer pressure when faced by incomprehension to blame yourself, back down, and think about something else.  By all means do this, but only if you yourself judge it right to do so. <br /><br /></div><b>LA: </b>Is there any general research-related lesson you have learnt in the process of working on nominal techniques?<br /><br /><b>AP: </b>On the one hand, don't lose sight of what application your theory is supposed to be good for; but on the other hand, let beauty and simplicity be your guide.<br /><br /><b>JG:</b> Yes:<br /><ul><li>Proving stuff is 30% of the work; convincing people is 70%. </li><li>It's the basic ideas that are hard, not the complicated theorems.</li><li>Competence and imagination are orthogonal. </li><li>It's doesn't have to be complex to be clever. </li><li>Elegant + applicable is a potent combination. </li><li>Seek out good listeners.  Give up quickly on bad ones.  Try to be a good listener. </li><li>Other people have a lot to teach you, but it might not be the things you expected. </li><li>Writing papers is fun.   </li></ul><b>LA: </b>Thanks to both of you for your willingness to answer my questions and congratulations for the awards you will be receiving this summer!</div>

The solving of Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) has been advanced considerably in the last two decades. In response to this, several proof systems have been put forward to universally verify QBF solvers. 
QRAT by Heule et al. is one such example of this and builds on technology from DRAT, a checking format used in propositional logic. 
Recent advances have shown conditional optimality results for QBF systems that use extension variables.
Since QRAT can simulate Extended Q-Resolution, we know it is strong, but we do not know if QRAT has the strategy extraction property as Extended Q-Resolution does. In this paper, we partially answer this question by showing that QRAT with a restricted reduction rule has strategy extraction (and consequentially is equivalent to Extended Q-Resolution modulo NP).
We also extend equivalence to another system, as we show an augmented version of QRAT known as QRAT+, developed by Lonsing and Egly, is in fact equivalent to the basic QRAT. We achieve this by constructing a line-wise simulation of QRAT+ using only steps valid in QRAT.</div>

<p>My <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2018/02/01/parallel-matching-in.html">paper with Vijay Vazirani on parallel matching</a> (soon to appear in <a href="http://spaa.acm.org/2019/">SPAA</a>) is based on the idea of a “matching-mimicking network”. If  is a graph with a designated set  of terminal vertices, then a matching-mimicking network for  is another graph  with the same terminals that has the same pattern of matchings. Here, by a <em>pattern of matchings</em>, I mean a family of subsets of , the subsets that can be covered by a matching that also covers all non-terminal vertices. We included a messy case analysis that, after some simplifications due to symmetry, had 21 cases for the matching mimicking networks on at most three terminals.</p>

<p>By now, I think I understand patterns of matchings a lot better, enough to do the three-terminal case in only four cases and to extend the analysis to four terminals in only seven more cases. The starting point is the observation that these patterns of matchings are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-matroid">even Δ-matroids</a>.</p>

<p>One way to think of a Δ-matroid is that it’s just a convex polyhedron or polytope in Euclidean space of some dimension , with the properties that all vertex coordinates are  or  and all edge lengths are  or . An even Δ-matroid has the stronger property that all edge lengths are , as is true for the three-dimensional regular tetrahedron with vertex coordinates (written in a more compact form as bitvectors) , , , and .</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/tet-in-cube.svg" alt="Regular tetrahedron formed from alternating vertices of a cube" /></p>

<p>Alternatively one can consider the same kind of structure to be a family of sets, drawn from a universe of  elements that correspond to the dimensions of the space. Each set in the family corresponds to a vertex of the polytope and includes the elements whose coordinates are one. So over the three-element set  the same regular tetrahedron can be written as the family of sets</p>



<p>When expressed in this way, the sets of a Δ-matroid obey an exchange axiom: if two sets  and  differ on whether they include some element , then there must exist an element  on which they also differ, so that the symmetric difference of sets  also belongs to the Δ-matroid. By repeatedly applying this axiom one can connect  to  by a geodesic path (in Hamming distance) of two-element moves. For the bases of a matroid, we have a stronger requirement that one of the two elements belongs to  and the other belongs to , or equivalently that all sets have the same size, but a Δ-matroid relaxes this requirement. It’s not even required that ! But in an even Δ-matroid  and  must be distinct, because otherwise the step would be along an edge of length one. Another way of expressing the extra requirements of an even Δ-matroid over an arbitrary Δ-matroid is that all sets must have the same parity (all have even size, or all have odd size).</p>

<p>So anyway, back to matching. Suppose that both  and  are sets drawn from a pattern of matchings. Choose arbitrarily a matching representing each set. Then the symmetric difference of these matchings is a collection of disjoint alternating paths and cycles, and we can get from  to  by 
a sequence of steps in which we take the symmetric difference of the current matching by one of the alternating paths. So this gives us not just one geodesic from  to  but a lot of different geodesics, one for each ordering of the alternating paths. Expressed as an exchange axiom, this means that when two sets  and  differ, the elements on which they differ can be partitioned into pairs, the symmetric differences with which can be performed independently. You can pick any subset of the pairs of differing elements, and change each of those pairs, leaving the rest alone. Because this is a strengthening of the even Δ-matroid axiom, every matching pattern is an even Δ-matroid.</p>

<p>Expressed in polyhedral terms, this stronger exchange axiom means that every two vertices at distance  from each other are connected by a -dimensional hypercube with side length . This is a little weird, because we started with a hypercube but then eliminated half of its vertices (by the parity condition) to get something else. Now we have hypercubes again, of lower dimension. They must be tilted with respect to the coordinate axes: each axis of one of these lower-dimensional hypercubes is tilted at a 45 degree angle with respect to the coordinate system of the overall polytope.</p>

<p>Not every even Δ-matroid obeys this sub-hypercube property. On the other hand, I was expecting the matching patterns that are matroids (all sets are the same size) to be transversal matroids (maximal subsets of vertices on one side of a bipartite graph that can be covered by a matching), and they aren’t. There is a six-element non-transversal matroid, whose six elements are the edges of a triangle with doubled edges and whose sets are pairs of edges from different sides of the triangle. But it is the pattern of matchings of a tree in which the (non-terminal) root has three children, each of which has two terminals as its children.</p>

<p>Conveniently, whether a 0-1 polyhedron can be represented by a pattern of matchings depends only on its shape and not on its orientation. You can obviously permute the coordinates of a polyhedron that represents a pattern of matchings, by relabeling which coordinate corresponds to which terminal vertex. But you can also reflect the polyhedron across any one of its coordinates by modifying the graph whose matchings represent it in the following way: turn the  terminal vertex for that coordinate into a non-terminal, and attach a new degree-one terminal vertex to it. These permutations and reflections generate all the symmetries of the hypercube in which the 0-1 polyhedron lives. So to find small matching-mimicking networks, we only need to look at one representative 0-1 polyhedron in each symmetry class. If we find a small network for this representative, we can modify it to create a different small matching-mimicking network for every other 0-1 polyhedron with the same shape.</p>

<p>So what are the possible shapes? Let’s define the dimension of a Δ-matroid to be the number of coordinates of the polytope that take both values,  and , at different vertices. Then a 0-dimensional even Δ-matroid must be a single point (), there are no 1-dimensional even Δ-matroids, and a two-dimensional even Δ-matroid must be a line segment (). There are two three-dimensional even Δ-matroids: a triangle  and the tetrahedron shown above, . The cube exchange axiom for patterns of matching starts to kick in for four-dimensional even Δ-matroids, whose vertices must be subsets of the four-dimensional hyperoctahedron . (This is the shape formed from a four-dimensional hypercube by keeping only vertices with the same parity as each other, just as we formed a regular tetrahedron by doing the same thing to a three-dimensional cube.) Here’s a drawing of  from <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2010/09/26/in-response-to.html">an earlier post</a>:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2010/k7/cocktail2.svg" alt="The hyperoctahedral graph K_{2,2,2,2}" /></p>

<p>If there are no two opposite vertices, we get  (a regular tetrahedron, again, but embedded in a four-dimensional way into the hypercube). Otherwise, we must take at least two pairs of opposite vertices to form a square, and the cases are  (only the square),  (a square pyramid),  (an octahedron), ,  (an octahedral pyramid), and  (the hyperoctahedron). All of these polyhedra can be represented as matching-mimicking networks with the additional property that all vertices are terminals:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/4-terminal-mm.svg" alt="Matching-mimicking networks for up to four terminals" /></p>

<p>Based on these small examples, it’s tempting to guess that when a pattern of matchings includes the empty set, the whole pattern is just the set of matchings on a graph whose edges are the pairs of terminals in the pattern. But it isn’t true. The square pyramid , for instance, can represent the pattern of matchings</p>



<p>with the empty set at the apex of the pyramid. In this pattern, even though one can match terminal pairs <span style="white-space: nowrap;">— or —,</span> one can’t take the union of those two matchings and cover all four terminals. (This is what you get by reflecting the two middle terminals of the network shown above for ; its matching-mimicking network is a tree with two interior non-terminals and four terminal leaves.) My guess is that the number of patterns of matching should grow quickly relative to the number of graphs, so for large enough numbers of terminals it should not be possible to use graphs without non-terminals or their complements. But I haven’t taken the case analysis far enough to find an example of this.</p>

Relations and Equivalences Between Circuit Lower Bounds and Karp-Lipton Theorems

A frontier open problem in circuit complexity is to prove P^NP is not in SIZE[n^k] for all k; this is a necessary intermediate step towards NP is not in P/poly. Previously, for several classes containing P^NP, including NP^NP, ZPP^NP, and S_2 P, such lower bounds have been proved via Karp-Lipton-style Theorems: to prove C is not in SIZE[n^k] for all k, we show that C subset Ppoly implies a ``collapse'' D = C for some larger class D, where we already know D is not in SIZE[n^k] for all k. 

It seems obvious that one could take a different approach to prove circuit lower bounds for P^NP that does not require proving any Karp-Lipton-style theorems along the way. We show this intuition is wrong: (weak) Karp-Lipton-style theorems for P^NP are equivalent to fixed-polynomial size circuit lower bounds for P^NP. That is, P^NP not subset SIZE[n^k] for all k if and only if (NP is in P/poly implies PH is in i.o.-P^NP/n).
		
Next, we present new consequences of the assumption NP is in P/poly, towards proving similar results for NP circuit lower bounds. We show that under the assumption, fixed-polynomial circuit lower bounds for NP, nondeterministic polynomial-time derandomizations, and various fixed-polynomial time simulations of NP are all equivalent. Applying this equivalence, we show that circuit lower bounds for NP imply better Karp-Lipton collapses. That is, if NP is not in SIZE[n^k] for all k, then for all C in { ParP, PP, PSPACE, EXP }, C is in P/poly implies C is in i.o.-NP/n^eps for all eps &gt; 0. Note that unconditionally, the collapses are only to MA and not NP.
		
We also explore consequences of circuit lower bounds for a sparse language in NP. Among other results, we show if a polynomially-sparse NP language does not have n^(1+eps)-size circuits, then MA is in i.o.-NP/O(log n), MA is in i.o.-P^{NP[O(log n)]}, and NEXP is not in SIZE[2^o(m)]. Finally, we observe connections between these results and the ``hardness magnification'' phenomena described in recent works.</div>

Alan Selman is a long-time friend of Ken and I, and is a long-time researcher in complexity theory. Alan was the first president of the organizing <a href="https://www.computationalcomplexity.org/governance.php">body</a> for the Computational Complexity Conferences (CCC). </p>
<p>
Today we salute the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0b100010%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0b100010}" class="latex" title="{0b100010}" />th edition of the conference and discuss some of the accepted papers.</p>
<p>
The conference, and the governing body, have changed names over the years; by any name it remains an important conference. Alan <a href="https://www.computationalcomplexity.org/documents/first-cfp.pdf">chaired</a> the first program committee with Steve Mahaney and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=648296&amp;picked=prox">edited</a> the first proceedings, in 1986. </p>
<p>
Ken recently saw Alan two weeks ago at the banquet for the <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/18-19/NP50">symposium</a> honoring Steve Cook at the University of Toronto. We will cover event, once <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/05/21/making-up-tests/">exams</a> are done. Ken saw another of the CCC past presidents there—if you wish to guess who, a hint is it was one of Cook’s past students.</p>

<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Six Papers with Some Comments </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Here are some papers that I, Dick, found interesting from the list of accepted papers. All accepted papers are interesting, of course. I selected six that were on topics that were directly connected with my interests.</p>
<p>
<b>Criticality of Regular Formulas</b>—<a href="http://www.math.toronto.edu/rossman/criticality.pdf">paper</a><br />
Benjamin Rossman<br />
<i>I thought this was about regular expressions. Shows something about me.</i> Here “regular” means the in-degree of gates being the same at each level of the circuit. This condition seems likely to be removable as Rossman conjectures, but I doubt it will be easy. The term “criticality” is a parameter that measures how much a random restriction reduces the size of a formula. Think switching lemma.</p>
<p>
<b>Typically-Correct Derandomization for Small Time and Space</b>—<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00565">paper</a><br />
William Hoza<br />
<i>I like the notion of typically-correct.</i> Their algorithms work by treating the input as a source of randomness. This idea was pioneered by Oded Goldreich and Avi Wigderson. The title of their 2002 <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/p_rnd02.html">article</a> “Derandomization that is rarely wrong from short advice that is typically good”, gives away how one can prove such results. </p>
<p>
<b>Optimal Short-Circuit Resilient Formulas</b>—<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05014">paper</a><br />
Mark Braverman, Klim Efremenko, Ran Gelles, and Michael Yitayew <br />
<i>This is on a kind of fault-tolerance.</i> They consider fault-tolerant boolean formulas in which the output of a faulty gate is stuck at one of the gate’s inputs. This is an interesting model of errors, and they show roughly: any formula can be converted into a formula that is not too much bigger and survives even if about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1/5}" class="latex" title="{1/5}" /> of the gates are faulty. A surprise is that they use a method related to <i>blockchains</i>. Hmmmmm. Interesting.</p>
<p>
<b>Fourier and Circulant Matrices are Not Rigid</b>—<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07334.pdf">paper</a><br />
Allen Liu and Zeev Dvir <br />
<i>A matrix is rigid if its rank cannot be reduced significantly by changing a small number of entries.</i> As you probably know there are plenty of rigid matrices—take random ones—but no provable examples of explicit ones. Their beautiful results prove that specific families of matrices are not rigid. These families include ones that were long thought to be rigid. The highlight of this work could be that it suggests new families that may be rigid. </p>
<p>
<b>Average-Case Quantum Advantage with Shallow Circuits</b>—<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.12792.pdf">paper</a><br />
François Le Gall <br />
<i>A quest, the quest that tops all others—is the search for evidence that quantum computers are better than classic ones.</i> Of course, this is nearly impossible, since P=PSPACE is an open problem. So one looks at special classes of computations. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.05903.pdf">here</a> for how the quest for “quantum advantage” meets up with computational complexity.</p>
<p>
<b>Relations and Equivalences Between Circuit Lower Bounds and Karp-Lipton Theorems</b><br />
<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/075/">paper</a><br />
Lijie Chen, Dylan McKay, Cody Murray, and Ryan Williams <br />
<i>Of course I think this is an interesting paper.</i> There is the famous H-score. Perhaps there could be a T-score. This would be the number of times your name is in the title of a published paper. Thus Ron Rivest, for example, has a huge T-score.</p>

This week I attended the <a href="https://asl2019.commons.gc.cuny.edu/">Association of Symbolic Logic North American Annual Meeting</a> in New York City, giving a talk on P v NP.<br />
<br />
First I must share the announcement that ASL member Tuna Antinel of Lyon 1 University has been arrested in Turkey for his political beliefs. <a href="http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/SoutienTunaAltinel/">This website</a> (<a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~adrien.deloro/">English version</a>) has details and how to show your support.<br />
<br />
I last attended the ASL annual meeting at Notre Dame in 1993 as a young assistant professor. Back then I talked about <a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/S0097539793248305">then recent work</a> using a special kind of generic oracle to make the Berman-Hartmanis isomorphism conjecture true. I remember someone coming up to me after the talk saying how excited they were to see such applications of logic. I'm not a theoretical computer scientist, I'm a applied logician.<br />
<br />
I asked at my talk this year and maybe 2-3 people were at that 1993 meeting. The attendance seemed smaller and younger, though that could be my memory playing tricks. I heard that the 2018 meeting in Macomb, Illinois drew a larger crowd. New York is expensive and logicians don't get large travel budgets.<br />
<br />
Logic like theoretical computer science has gotten more specialized so I was playing catch up trying to follow many of the talks. Mariya Soskova of Wisconsin talked about enumeration degrees that brought me back to the days I sat in logic classes and talks at the University of Chicago. A set A is enumeration reducible to B if from an enumeration of B you can compute an enumeration of A and Mariya gave a great overview of this area.<br />
<br />
I learned about the status of an open problem for Turing reducibility: Is there a non-trivial automorphism of the Turing Degrees? A degree is the equivalence class where each class are the languages all computably Turing-reducible to each other. So the question asks if there is a bijection f mapping degrees to degrees, other than identity, that preserves reducibility or lack thereof.<br />
<br />
Here's what's known: There are countably many such automorphisms. There is a definable degree C in the arithmetic hierarchy, such that if f(C) = C then f is the identity. Also if f is the identity on all the c.e.-degrees (those equivalence classes containing a computably enumerable set), then f is the identity on all the degrees. Still open if there is more than one automorphism.<br />
<br />

<blockquote><p>Abstract: Multiplication is one of the most fundamental computational problems, yet its true complexity remains elusive. The best known upper bound, very recently proved by Harvey and Van Der Hoven shows that two <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" />-bit numbers can be multiplied via a boolean circuit of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n+%5Clg+n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="O(n \lg n)" class="latex" title="O(n \lg n)" />.</p>
<p>We prove that if a central conjecture in the area of network coding is true, then any constant degree Boolean circuit for multiplication must have size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega%28n+%5Clg+n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="\Omega(n \lg n)" class="latex" title="\Omega(n \lg n)" />, thus (conditioned on the conjecture) completely settling the complexity of multiplication circuits. We additionally revisit classic conjectures in circuit complexity, due to Valiant, and show that the network coding conjecture also implies one of Valiant’s conjectures.</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="fontstyle0">We disagree with how marijuana policy is being shaped in the Commonwealth.</span></li>
<li><span class="fontstyle0">The science is clear; marijuana, specifically the psychoactive chemical THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol), has the potential to do significant harm to public health.</span></li>
<li><span class="fontstyle0">Diversion of high THC products (≥10%), vapes and edibles, to MA youth is a growing concern.</span></li>
<li><span class="fontstyle0">When public health is not prioritized in the regulation of addictive substances, the public and our young people are put at risk.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also find in the statement a list of negative effects of THC.  This is all signed by a dozen+ doctors. The various marijuana players with zero medical knowledge will probably dismiss the experts’ opinion with, at best, a shrug. Instead, they are looking into opening <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2019/05/16/massachusetts-marijuana-cafes-social-consumption">marijuana cafes</a>. And the first marijuana retail store will open in Newton <a href="https://patch.com/massachusetts/newton/newtons-first-recreational-marijuana-shop-has-grand-opening-date">this Saturday</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to get even more worked up about marijuana reading my <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2019/01/27/selling-your-town-to-the-marijuana-industry/">previous post</a> might help.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://www.mapreventionalliance.org/">on June 5^th there will be a luncheon event at the JFK Library titled: Marijuana: Addiction, Mental Health and Policy – Advances in Research…What have we learned in the past 5 years?</a></p></div>

The Fiat-Shamir heuristic transforms a public-coin interactive proof into a non-interactive argument, by replacing the verifier with a cryptographic hash function that is applied to the protocol’s transcript. Constructing hash functions for which this transformation is sound is a central and long-standing open question in cryptography.

We show that solving the End-of-Metered-Line problem is no easier than breaking the soundness of the Fiat-Shamir transformation when applied to the sumcheck protocol. In particular, if the transformed protocol is sound, then any hard problem in #P gives rise to a hard distribution in the class CLS, which is contained in PPAD.

Our main technical contribution is a stateful incrementally verifiable procedure that, given a SAT instance over n variables, counts the number of satisfying assignments. This is accomplished via an exponential sequence of small steps, each computable in time poly(n). Incremental verifiability means that each intermediate state includes a sumcheck-based proof of its correctness, and the proof can be updated and verified in time poly(n).

Combining our construction with a hash family proposed by Canetti et al. [STOC 2019] gives rise to a distribution in the class CLS, which is provably hard under the assumption that any one of a class of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes has almost-optimal security against quasi-polynomial time adversaries, and under the additional worst-case assumption that there is no polynomial time algorithm for counting the number of satisfying assignments for formulas over a polylogarithmic number of variables.</div>

<p>Today I participated in the successful dissertation defense of Bálint Tillman, a student of Athina Markopoulou in the <a href="http://www.networkedsystems.uci.edu/">UCI Graduate Program in Networked Systems</a>.</p>

<p>Bálint has been investigating problems connected with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Gallai_theorem">Erdős–Gallai theorem</a>, which states that it is possible to test whether a sequence of numbers is the degree distribution of a graph (the sequence of numbers of vertices of each possible degree) and if so, find a graph with that degree distribution, in polynomial time. The degree distribution can be extended to a matrix called the <em>joint degree distribution</em>, which specifies the number of pairs of adjacent vertices with each combination of degrees, and to higher-order tensors specifying the degrees of subgraphs with more than two vertices.</p>

<p>In his INFOCOM 2015 paper “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218534">Construction of simple graphs with a target joint degree matrix and beyond</a>”, Bálint showed that one can recognize the joint degree distributions of simple graphs, and reconstruct a graph with that distribution, in polynomial time. The algorithm works equally well when the vertices are distinguished in other ways than by degree and the input matrix specifies the target number of edges with each pair of degrees between each class of vertices. Later, in KDD 2017, he extended these results to directed graphs and at NetSci 2018 he showed how to find a realization with as few connected components as possible.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if one adds only a little bit of extra information to the joint degree distribution, such as the total number of triangles in the graph, it becomes NP-complete to recognize whether the input describes a valid graph and NP-hard to reconstruct a graph that realizes a given description. This comes from a poster by Bálint with Will Devanny and me at NetSci 2016, where we found the reduction from graph 3-coloring depicted below.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/jdm-tri-hard.svg" alt="NP-completeness reduction from 3-coloring to realizability of joint degree matrices with numbers of triangles" /></p>

<p>To perform an NP-hardness reduction, one should start with a graph for which it’s hard to test 3-colorability, and translate it into an instance of whatever other problem you want to prove hard. But instead let’s pretend for now that we start with a little more information: a graph that’s known to be 3-colorable, and a specific 3-coloring of it.
To turn this into a hard problem for realizability of joint distribution plus number of triangles, we add a triangle to the graph, representing the three colors, and connect each original graph vertex to the new triangle vertex for its color. Then we add enough hair (in the form of degree-one vertices) to the augmented graph to make all vertices have distinct degrees, except within the triangle of new vertices where all three degrees should be the same. Now take as the result of the reduction the pair  of the joint degree distribution and number of triangles in the augmented graph.</p>

<p>But now the trick is that  can be computed directly from your starting graph, without knowing its coloring or even whether it is colorable.
Because the degrees are distinct, and  tells you the number of edges for each combination of degrees, any realization of  must contain a copy of your starting graph augmented by a triangle. The graph and the triangle might be connected to each other differently than they were before, but their connection pattern must still correspond to a different valid 3-coloring, because otherwise you would form some extra triangles in the graph (one for each invalidly-colored edge) and not correctly match the value of . So  is realizable if and only if your starting graph has a 3-coloring. This reduction proves that testing realizability of pairs  is NP-complete.</p>

<p>There’s even more material along these lines in Bálint’s dissertation, but some of it is not yet published. I think the plan is to get all of that submitted over the summer before
Bálint starts a new position at Google.
Congratulations, Bálint!</p>
