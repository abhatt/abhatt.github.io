This post explains in simple words a recent development in the theory and practice of directed acyclic graph-based (DAG-based) Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus, published in three prestigious peer-reviewed conferences, and currently being integrating into several Blockchain companies, e.g., Aptos, Celo, MystenLabs, and Somelier.

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>You may have played with a paper yoyo, a strip of paper wrapped around a stick so that when you flick it with your wrist, it extends outward into a long tube. Here’s one, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Arcade_Paper_Laser,_August_8th_2016.jpeg">the only example I could find on Wikimedia Commons</a>:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/paper-yoyo.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Arcade Paper Laser, public domain image by Zhonghua88, 8 August 2016, from Wikimedia Commons" /></p>

<p>If you’ve used one, then the way they work is simple and intuitive. But if you know a little bit about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_of_paper_folding">mathematics of paper folding</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developable_surface">developable surfaces</a>, and think about it, it starts to seem a little strange.</p>

<p>Paper can bend or fold, but not stretch. When a flat sheet of paper is bent into a smooth but not flat surface (as it is in all states of the paper yoyo), it bends along straight “bend lines” that extend all the way across the surface, and that are forced to remain straight. You may be familiar with the way that a slice of pizza will droop if you try to hold it flat from its crust, but will remain straight if you bend it lengthwise: the bend lines are holding it in a rigid shape. Or, if you roll a poster into a cylinder, you can wave it around like a light saber, again making it much more rigid than the unrolled poster (at least until you hit it into something hard enough to crumple it).</p>

<p>In the rolled-up state of the paper yoyo, it’s again rolled into a cylinder, with bend lines parallel to the cylinder axis. If we mark some of those bend lines and unroll it flat, it might look something like this:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/paper-yoyo-rolled.svg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Bend lines in a rolled paper yoyo" /></p>

<p>But then, what happens when you extend it? The paper cannot stretch from its rectangular shape into a parallelogram. Instead, as it extends, the bend lines continuously rotate on the surface of the paper. Near the point where they attach to the stick, the non-perpendicular bend lines cause the paper to flare out a little from its cylindrical shape, but it is surrounded by more wrapped paper constraining it from flaring very widely, so the bend lines must still stay near their original orientations. Farther along the yoyo, the bend lines can twist to bigger angles:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/paper-yoyo-extended.svg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Bend lines in a rolled paper yoyo" /></p>

<p>So although the bend lines of a smoothly bent sheet of paper are rigid along their length, they can slide and twist continuously within the sheet, as the sheet flexes continuously while remaining smooth. This twisting motion of bend lines is essential for understanding the seemingly-knotted surface below, two round disks connected by a thin band tied in an overhand knot:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/knotted-dumbbell.svg" alt="Knotted paper dumbbell shape" /></p>

<p>If you want to unknot it while keeping it smooth rather than crumpling it, you will obviously have to make the disks smaller by rolling them up somehow, perhaps into a cylinder around one of their diameters. But if you do that, you will put a bend line through or near the diameter, which will act like a rigid rod. And if you attach the knotted center band to two rigid rods, of length equal to the diameter of the disks, you definitely cannot untie it. The rods are too long to poke all the way through the knot before getting stuck.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this surface can be untied while keeping it smooth! The trick is that, after you have rolled up one of the disks to make a rigid cylinder, with the tied band at one end, you can twist the roll, so that its bend lines rotate around the disk. As you do, the point where the band is tied will slide from one end of the cylinder to the other. And you can make this sliding motion coincide with the motion of the cylinder through a hole in the tied band, untying it.</p>

<p>This and similar examples are the focus of my third new CCCG preprint, “Locked and unlocked smooth embeddings of surfaces”, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12989">arXiv:2206.12989</a>. In the phrasing of the title, the two disks with a tied center band, above, are unlocked: they can be reconfigured to a flat state while remaining smooth. My paper also shows that any compact shape with a continuous shrinking motion into itself, like the polygon below, is unlocked.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/generalized-star.svg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Polygon with a continuous shrinking motion" /></p>

<p>On the other hand, there exist surfaces that, while topologically equivalent to their flat state, cannot be made flat through a continuous sequence of smooth embeddings. The simplest one that I found consists of a central square mat, rolled up into a cylinder and held into its cylindrical shape by two loops, entangled with each other in a pattern based on the Borromean rings:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/tied-roll.svg" alt="Locked shape consisting of a rolled square mat with two entangled loops" /></p>

<p>There is actually quite a lot of freedom in the pattern of bend lines of the central square. They can twist until the bend line through the center of the square gets halfway to the corners of the square:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/bent-roll.svg" alt="Twisted bend lines in the rolled square mat" /></p>

<p>But after that point, the entangled loops block the twisting from going any farther. They cannot be disentangled from each other without being pulled around the rigid central bend line, and they are too short for that to be possible, so the surface is locked.</p>

<p>It’s not clear to me whether all simple polygons are unlocked, or whether it’s possible to make locked polygons without holes. I also don’t have any algorithmic results in this area; it seems likely that testing whether a surface is locked or unlocked is hard, but I don’t know how to prove it.</p>

<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>Before June 2022 was the month of the possible start of the Second American Civil War, it was the month of <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/my-bet-ai-size-solves-flubs?s=w">a</a> <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/what-does-it-mean-when-an-ai-fails">lively</a> <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/somewhat-contra-marcus-on-ai-scaling">debate</a> <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/does-ai-really-need-a-paradigm-shift?s=w">between</a> Scott Alexander and Gary Marcus about the scaling of large language models, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT-3</a>.  Will GPT-<em>n</em> be able to do all the intellectual work that humans do, in the limit of large <em>n</em>?  If so, should we be impressed?  Terrified?  Should we dismiss these language models as mere “stochastic parrots”?</p>



<p>I was privileged to be part of various email exchanges about those same questions with Steven Pinker, Ernest Davis, Gary Marcus, Douglas Hofstadter, and Scott Alexander.  It’s fair to say that, overall, Pinker, Davis, Marcus, and Hofstadter were more impressed by GPT-3’s blunders, while we Scotts were more impressed by its abilities.  (On the other hand, Hofstadter, more so than Pinker, Davis, or Marcus, said that he’s terrified about how powerful GPT-like systems will become in the future.)</p>



<p>Anyway, at some point Pinker produced an essay setting out his thoughts, and asked whether “either of the Scotts” wanted to share it on our blogs.  Knowing an intellectual scoop when I see one, I answered that I’d be honored to host Steve’s essay—along with my response, along with Steve’s response to <em>that</em>.  To my delight, Steve immediately agreed.  Enjoy!  –SA</p>

<h2><strong>Steven Pinker’s Initial Salvo</strong></h2>



<p>Will future deep learning models with more parameters and trained on more examples avoid the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/22/1007539/gpt3-openai-language-generator-artificial-intelligence-ai-opinion/">silly blunders</a> which Gary Marcus and Ernie Davis entrap GPT into making, and render their criticisms obsolete?  And if they keep exposing new blunders in new models, would this just be <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/my-bet-ai-size-solves-flubs?s=r">moving the goalposts</a>?  Either way, what’s at stake?</p>



<p>It depends very much on the question.  There’s the cognitive science question of whether humans think and speak the way GPT-3 and other deep-learning neural network models do.  And there’s the engineering question of whether the way to develop better, humanlike AI is to upscale deep learning models (as opposed to incorporating different mechanisms, like a knowledge database and propositional reasoning).</p>



<p>The questions are, to be sure, related: If a model is incapable of duplicating a human feat like language understanding, it can’t be a good theory of how the human mind works.  Conversely, if a model flubs some task that humans can ace, perhaps it’s because it’s missing some mechanism that powers the human mind.  Still, they’re not the same question: As with airplanes and other machines, an artificial system can duplicate or exceed a natural one but work in a different way.</p>



<p>Apropos the scientific question, I don’t see the Marcus-Davis challenges as benchmarks or long bets that they have to rest their case on.  I see them as scientific probing of an empirical hypothesis, namely whether the human language capacity works like GPT-3.  Its failures of common sense are one form of evidence that the answer is “no,” but there are others—for example, that it needs to be trained on half a trillion words, or about 10,000 years of continuous speech, whereas human children get pretty good after 3 years.  Conversely, it needs no social and perceptual context to make sense of its training set, whereas children do (hearing children of deaf parents don’t learn spoken language from radio and TV).  Another diagnostic is that baby-talk is very different from the output of a partially trained GPT.  Also, humans can generalize their language skill to express their intentions across a wide range of social and environmental contexts, whereas GPT-3 is fundamentally a text extrapolator (a task, incidentally, which humans aren’t particularly good at).  There are surely other empirical probes, limited only by scientific imagination, and it doesn’t make sense in science to set up a single benchmark for an empirical question once and for all.  As we learn more about a phenomenon, and as new theories compete to explain it, we need to develop more sensitive instruments and more clever empirical tests.  That’s what I see Marcus and Davis as doing.</p>



<p>Regarding the second, engineering question of whether scaling up deep-learning models will “get us to Artificial General Intelligence”: I think the question is probably ill-conceived, because I think the concept of “general intelligence” is meaningless.  (I’m not referring to the psychometric variable <em>g</em>, also called “general intelligence,” namely the principal component of correlated variation across IQ subtests.  This is  a variable that aggregates many contributors to the brain’s efficiency such as cortical thickness and neural transmission speed, but it is not a mechanism (just as “horsepower” is a meaningful variable, but it doesn’t explain how cars move.)  I find most characterizations of AGI to be either circular (such as “smarter than humans in every way,” begging the question of what “smarter” means) or mystical—a kind of omniscient, omnipotent, and clairvoyant power to solve any problem.  No logician has ever outlined a normative model of what general intelligence would consist of, and even Turing swapped it out for the problem of fooling an observer, which spawned 70 years of unhelpful reminders of how easy it is to fool an observer.</p>



<p>If we do try to define “intelligence” in terms of mechanism rather than magic, it seems to me it would be something like “the ability to use information to attain a goal in an environment.”  (“Use information” is shorthand for performing computations that embody laws that govern the world, namely logic, cause and effect, and statistical regularities.  “Attain a goal” is shorthand for optimizing the attainment of <em>multiple</em> goals, since different goals trade off.)  Specifying the goal is critical to any definition of intelligence: a given strategy in basketball will be intelligent if you’re trying to win a game and stupid if you’re trying to throw it.  So is the environment: a given strategy can be smart under NBA rules and stupid under college rules.</p>



<p>Since a goal itself is neither intelligent or unintelligent (Hume and all that), but must be exogenously built into a system, and since no physical system has clairvoyance for all the laws of the world it inhabits down to the last butterfly wing-flap, this implies that there are as many intelligences as there are goals and environments.  There will be no omnipotent superintelligence or wonder algorithm (or singularity or AGI or existential threat or foom), just better and better gadgets.</p>



<p>In the case of humans, natural selection has built in multiple goals—comfort, pleasure, reputation, curiosity, power, status, the well-being of loved ones—which may trade off, and are sometimes randomized or inverted in game-theoretic paradoxical tactics.  Not only does all this make psychology hard, but it makes human intelligence a dubious benchmark for artificial systems.  Why would anyone <em>want </em>to emulate human intelligence in an artificial system (any more than a mechanical engineer would want to duplicate a human body, with all its fragility)?  Why not build the best possible autonomous vehicle, or language translator, or dishwasher-emptier, or baby-sitter, or protein-folding predictor?  And who cares whether the best autonomous vehicle driver would be, out of the box, a good baby-sitter?  Only someone who thinks that intelligence is some all-powerful elixir.</p>



<p>Back to GPT-3, DALL-E, LaMDA, and other deep learning models: It seems to me that the question of whether or not they’re taking us closer to “Artificial General Intelligence” (or, heaven help us, “sentience”) is based not on any analysis of what AGI would consist of but on our being gobsmacked by what they can do.  But refuting our intuitions about what a massively trained, massively parameterized network is capable of (and I’ll admit that they refuted mine) should not be confused with a path toward omniscience and omnipotence.  GPT-3 is unquestionably awesome at its designed-in goal of extrapolating text.  But that is not the main goal of human language competence, namely expressing and perceiving intentions.  Indeed, the program is not even set up to input or output intentions, since that would require deep thought about how to represent intentions, which went out of style in AI as the big-data/deep-learning hammer turned every problem into a nail.  That’s why no one is using GPT-3 to answer their email or write an article or legal brief (except to show how well the program can spoof one).</p>



<p>So is Scott Alexander right that every scaled-up GPT-<em>n</em> will avoid the blunders that Marcus and Davis show in GPT-(<em>n</em>-1)?  Perhaps, though I doubt it, for reasons that Marcus and Davis explain well (in particular, that astronomical training sets at best compensate for their being crippled by the lack of a world model).  But even if they do, that would show neither that human language competence is a GPT (given the totality of the relevant evidence) nor that GPT-<em>n</em> is approaching Artificial General Intelligence (whatever that is).</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<h2><strong>Scott Aaronson’s Response</strong></h2>



<p>As usual, I find Steve crystal-clear and precise—so much so that we can quickly dispense with the many points of agreement.  Basically, one side says that, while GPT-3 is of course mind-bogglingly impressive, and while it refuted confident predictions that no such thing would work, in the end it’s just a text-prediction engine that will run with any absurd premise it’s given, and it fails to model the world the way humans do.  The other side says that, while GPT-3 is of course just a text-prediction engine that will run with any absurd premise it’s given, and while it fails to model the world the way humans do, in the end it’s mind-bogglingly impressive, and it refuted confident predictions that no such thing would work.</p>



<p>All the same, I do think it’s possible to identify a substantive disagreement between the distinguished baby-boom linguistic thinkers and the gen-X/gen-Y blogging Scott A.’s: namely, whether there’s a coherent concept of “general intelligence.”  Steve writes:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>No logician has ever outlined a normative model of what general intelligence would consist of, and even Turing swapped it out for the problem of fooling an observer, which spawned 70 years of unhelpful reminders of how easy it is to fool an observer.</p></blockquote>



<p>I freely admit that I have no principled definition of “general intelligence,” let alone of “superintelligence.”  To my mind, though, there’s a simple proof-of-principle that there’s <em>something</em> an AI could do that pretty much any of us would call “superintelligent.”  Namely, it could say whatever Albert Einstein would say in a given situation, while thinking a thousand times faster.  Feed the AI all the information about physics that the historical Einstein had in 1904, for example, and it would discover special relativity in a few hours, followed by general relativity a few days later.  Give the AI a year, and it would think … well, whatever thoughts Einstein would’ve thought, if he’d had a millennium in peak mental condition to think them.</p>



<p>If nothing else, this AI could work by simulating Einstein’s brain neuron-by-neuron—provided we believe in the computational theory of mind, as I’m assuming we do.  It’s true that we don’t <em>know</em> the detailed structure of Einstein’s brain in order to simulate it (we might have, had the pathologist who <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/1997/10/driving-mr-albert/">took it</a> from the hospital used cold rather than warm formaldehyde).  But that’s irrelevant to the argument.  It’s also true that the AI won’t experience the same environment that Einstein would have—so, alright, imagine putting it in a very comfortable simulated study, and letting it interact with the world’s flesh-based physicists.  A-Einstein can even propose experiments for the human physicists to do—he’ll just have to wait an <em>excruciatingly</em> long subjective time for their answers.  But that’s OK: as an AI, he never gets old.</p>



<p>Next let’s throw into the mix AI Von Neumann, AI Ramanujan, AI Jane Austen, even AI Steven Pinker—all, of course, sped up 1,000x compared to their meat versions, even able to interact with thousands of sped-up copies of themselves and other scientists and artists.  Do we agree that these entities quickly become the predominant intellectual force on earth—to the point where there’s little for the original humans left to do but understand and implement the AIs’ outputs (and, of course, eat, drink, and enjoy their lives, assuming the AIs can’t or don’t want to prevent that)?  If so, then that seems to suffice to call the AIs “superintelligences.”  Yes, <em>of course</em> they’re still limited in their ability to manipulate the physical world.  Yes, <em>of course</em> they still don’t optimize arbitrary goals.  All the same, these AIs have effects on the real world consistent with the sudden appearance of beings able to run intellectual rings around humans—not <em>exactly</em> as we do around chimpanzees, but not exactly unlike it either.</p>



<p>I should clarify that, in practice, I don’t expect AGI to work by slavishly emulating humans—and not only because of the practical difficulties of scanning brains, especially deceased ones.  Like with airplanes, like with existing deep learning, I expect future AIs to take some inspiration from the natural world but also to depart from it whenever convenient.  The point is that, since there’s <em>something</em> that would plainly count as “superintelligence,” the question of whether it can be achieved is therefore “merely” an engineering question, not a philosophical one.</p>



<p>Obviously I don’t know the answer to the engineering question: no one does!  One could consistently hold that, while the thing I described would clearly count as “superintelligence,” it’s just an amusing fantasy, unlikely to be achieved for millennia if ever.  One could hold that all the progress in AI so far, including the scaling of language models, has taken us only 0% or perhaps 0.00001% of the way toward superintelligence so defined.</p>



<p>So let me make two comments about the engineering question.  The first is that there’s good news here, at least epistemically: unlike with the philosophical questions, we’re virtually guaranteed more clarity over time!  Indeed, we’ll know vastly more just by the end of this decade, as the large language models are further scaled and tweaked, and we find out whether they develop effective representations of the outside world and of themselves, the ability to reject absurd premises and avoid self-contradiction, or even the ability to generate original mathematical proofs and scientific hypotheses.  Of course, Gary Marcus and Scott Alexander have already placed concrete bets on the table for what sorts of things will be possible by 2030.  For all their differences in rhetoric, I was struck that their <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/somewhat-contra-marcus-on-ai-scaling">actual</a> <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/does-ai-really-need-a-paradigm-shift?s=w#footnote-anchor-1">probabilities</a> differed much more modestly.</p>



<p>So then what explains the glaring differences in rhetoric?  This brings me to my second comment: whenever there’s a new, rapidly-growing, poorly-understood phenomenon, whether it’s the Internet or AI or COVID, there are two wildly different modes of responding to it, which we might call “February 2020 mode” and “March 2020 mode.”  In February 2020 mode, one says: yes, a naïve extrapolation might lead someone to the conclusion that this new thing is going to expand exponentially and conquer the world, dramatically changing almost every other domain—but precisely <em>because</em> that conclusion seems absurd on its face, it’s our responsibility as serious intellectuals to articulate what’s wrong with the arguments that lead to it.  In March 2020 mode, one says: holy crap, the naïve extrapolation seems right!  Prepare!!  Why didn’t we start earlier?</p>



<p>Often, to be sure, February 2020 mode is the better mode, at least for outsiders—as with the Y2K bug, or the many disease outbreaks that fizzle.  My point here is simply that February 2020 mode and March 2020 mode differ by only a month.  Sometimes hearing a single argument, seeing a single example, is enough to trigger an epistemic cascade, causing all the same facts to be seen in a new light.  As a result, reasonable people might find themselves on opposite sides of the chasm even if they started just a few steps from each other.</p>



<p>As for me?  Well, I’m currently trying to hold the line around February 26, 2020.  Suspending my day job in the humdrum, pedestrian field of quantum computing, I’ve decided to spend a year at OpenAI, thinking about the theoretical foundations of AI safety.  But for now, only a year.</p>

<h2><strong>Steven Pinker’s Response to Scott</strong></h2>



<p>Thanks, Scott, for your thoughtful and good-natured reply, and for offering me the opportunity to respond  in <em>Shtetl-Optimized, </em>one of my favorite blogs. Despite the areas of agreement, I still think that discussions of AI and its role in human affairs—including AI safety—will be muddled as long as the writers treat intelligence as an undefined superpower rather than a mechanisms with a makeup that determines what it can and can’t do. We won’t get clarity on AI if we treat the “I” as “whatever fools us,” or “whatever amazes us,” or “whatever IQ tests measure,” or “whatever we have more of than animals do,” or “whatever Einstein has more of than we do”—and then start to worry about a superintelligence that has much, much more of whatever that is.</p>



<p>Take Einstein sped up a thousandfold. To begin with, current AI is not even taking us in that direction. As you note, no one is reverse-engineering his connectome, and current AI does not think the way Einstein thought, namely by visualizing physical scenarios and manipulating mathematical equations. Its current pathway would be to train a neural network with billions of physics problems and their solutions and hope that it would soak up the statistical patterns.</p>



<p>Of course, the reason you pointed to a sped-up Einstein was to procrastinate having to define “superintelligence.” But if intelligence is a collection of mechanisms rather than a quantity that Einstein was blessed with a lot of, it’s not clear that just speeding him up would capture what anyone would call superintelligence. After all, in many areas Einstein was no Einstein. You above all could speak of his not-so-superintelligence in quantum physics, and when it came world affairs, in the early 1950s he offered the not exactly prescient or practicable prescription, “Only the creation of a world government can prevent the impending self-destruction of mankind.” So it’s not clear that we <em>would </em>call a system that could dispense such pronouncements in seconds rather than years “superintelligent.” Nor with speeding up other geniuses, say, an AI Bertrand Russell, who would need just nanoseconds to offer his own solution for world peace: the Soviet Union would be given an ultimatum that unless it immediately submitted to world government, the US (which at the time had a nuclear monopoly) would bomb it with nuclear weapons.</p>



<p>My point isn’t to poke retrospective fun at brilliant men, but to reiterate that brilliance itself is not some uncanny across-the-board power that can be “scaled” by speeding it up or otherwise; it’s an engineered system that does particular things in particular ways. Only with a <em>criterion </em>for intelligence can we say which of these counts as intelligent.</p>



<p>Now, it’s true that raw speed makes new kinds of computation possible, and I feel silly writing this to you of all people, but speeding a process up by a constant factor is of limited use with problems that are exponential, as the space of possible scientific theories, relative to their complexity, must be. Speeding up a search in the space of theories a thousandfold would be a rounding error in the time it took to find a correct one. Scientific progress depends on the search exploring the infinitesimal fraction of the space in which the true theories are likely to lie, and this depends on the quality of the intelligence, not just its raw speed.</p>



<p>And it depends as well on a phenomenon you note, namely that scientific progress depends on empirical discovery, not deduction from a silicon armchair. The particle accelerators and space probes and wet labs and clinical trials still have to be implemented, with data accumulating at a rate set by the world. Strokes of genius can surely speed up the rate of discovery, but in the absence of omniscience about every particle, the time scale will still be capped by empirical reality. And this in turn directs the search for viable theories: which part of the space one should explore is guided by the current state of scientific knowledge, which depends on the tempo of discovery. Speeding up scientists a thousandfold would not speed up science a thousandfold.</p>



<p>All this is relevant to AI safety. I’m all for safety, but I worry that the dazzling intellectual capital being invested in the topic will not make us any safer if it begins with a woolly conception of intelligence as a kind of wonder stuff that you can have in different amounts. It leads to unhelpful analogies, like “exponential increase in the number of infectious people during a pandemic” ≈ “exponential increase in intelligence in AI systems.” It encourages other questionable extrapolations from the human case, such as imagining that an intelligent tool will develop an alpha-male lust for domination. Worst of all, it may encourage misconceptions of AI risk itself, particularly the standard scenario in which a hypothetical future AGI is given some preposterously generic single goal such as “cure cancer” or “make people happy” and theorists fret about the hilarious collateral damage that would ensue.</p>



<p>If intelligence is a mechanism rather than a superpower, the real dangers of AI come into sharper focus. An AI system designed to replace workers may cause mass unemployment; a system designed to use data to sort people may sort them in ways we find invidious; a system designed to fool people may be exploited to fool them in nefarious ways; and as many other hazards as there are AI systems. These dangers are not conjectural, and I suspect each will have to be mitigated by a different combination of policies and patches, just like other safety challenges such as falls, fires, and drownings. I’m curious whether, once intelligence is precisely characterized, any abstract theoretical foundations of AI safety will be useful in dealing with the actual AI dangers that will confront us.</p></div>

crucial for the quality of the learned clusters. In this paper, we develop a
new initialization scheme, called HST initialization, for the $k$-median

based on the construction of metric embedding tree structure of the data. From
the tree, we propose a novel and efficient search algorithm, for good initial
centers that can be used subsequently for the local search algorithm. Our
proposed HST initialization can produce initial centers achieving lower errors
than those from another popular initialization method, $k$-median++, with
comparable efficiency. The HST initialization can also be extended to the
setting of differential privacy (DP) to generate private initial centers. We
show that the error from applying DP local search followed by our private HST
initialization improves previous results on the approximation error, and
approaches the lower bound within a small factor. Experiments justify the
theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our approach
can also be extended to the $k$-means problem.

approach to improve the spectrum utilization and to increase the monetary
income of MNOs. In this paper, we model a nonorthogonal spectrum sharing system
for a large-scale cellular network where multiple seller MNOs lease their
licensed sub-bands to several buyer MNOs. We first analyze the per-user
expected rate and the per-MNO expected profit using stochastic geometry. Then,
we formulate the joint problem of power control and licensed sub-band sharing
to maximize the expected profit of all MNOs as a multiobjective optimization
problem (MOOP) under the users' quality of service requirement and the
nonnegative return on investment constraints. To transform the MOOP into a
single objective form, we use a combination of the $\epsilon$-constraint and
weighted sum methods. However, the transformed problem is nonconvex because of
the presence of binary variables and nonconvex rate functions in the objective
function and constraints. We address this problem by using a penalty function
and approximating the nonconvex rate functions by a constrained stochastic
successive convex approximation method. Finally, the numerical results show the
correctness and performance of the proposed algorithm under various conditions.

Scheduling on Unrelated Machines. It is a classical scheduling problem
motivated from just-in-time or lean manufacturing, where the goal is to
complete jobs exactly at their deadline. We are given $n$ jobs and $m$
machines. Each job has a deadline, a weight, and a processing time that may be
different on each machine. The goal is find a schedule that maximized the total
weight of jobs completed exactly at their deadline. Note that this uniquely
defines a processing time interval for each job on each machine.
</p>
<p>Interval Scheduling on Unrelated Machines is closely related to coloring
interval graphs and has been thoroughly studied for several decades. However,
as pointed out by Mnich and van Bevern [Computers \&amp; Operations Research,
2018], the parameterized complexity for the number $m$ of machines as a
parameter remained open. We resolve this by showing that Interval Scheduling on
Unrelated Machines is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the number $m$ of
machines. To this end, we prove W[1]-hardness with respect to $m$ of the
special case where we have parallel machines with eligible machine sets for
jobs. This answers Open Problem 8 of Mnich and van Bevern's list of 15 open
problems in the parameterized complexity of scheduling [Computers \&amp; Operations
Research, 2018].
</p>
<p>Furthermore, we resolve the computational complexity status of the unweighted
version of Interval Scheduling on Unrelated Machines by proving that it is
NP-complete. This answers an open question by Sung and Vlach [Journal of
Scheduling, 2005].

to be independent Gaussian vectors. We observe that by instead initializing the
weights into independent pairs, where each pair consists of two identical
Gaussian vectors, we can significantly improve the convergence analysis. While
a similar technique has been studied for random inputs [Daniely, NeurIPS 2020],
it has not been analyzed with arbitrary inputs. Using this technique, we show
how to significantly reduce the number of neurons required for two-layer ReLU
networks, both in the under-parameterized setting with logistic loss, from
roughly $\gamma^{-8}$ [Ji and Telgarsky, ICLR 2020] to $\gamma^{-2}$, where
$\gamma$ denotes the separation margin with a Neural Tangent Kernel, as well as
in the over-parameterized setting with squared loss, from roughly $n^4$ [Song
and Yang, 2019] to $n^2$, implicitly also improving the recent running time
bound of [Brand, Peng, Song and Weinstein, ITCS 2021]. For the
under-parameterized setting we also prove new lower bounds that improve upon
prior work, and that under certain assumptions, are best possible.

bounds on areas (e.g., nodes in a spatial network) where possible rendezvous
activity could have occurred. The problem is important for reducing the onerous
amount of manual effort to post-process possible rendezvous areas using
satellite imagery and has many societal applications to improve public safety,
security, and health. The problem of rendezvous detection is challenging due to
the difficulty of interpreting missing data within a trajectory gap and the
very high cost of detecting gaps in such a large volume of location data. Most
recent literature presents formal models, namely space-time prism, to track an
object's rendezvous patterns within trajectory gaps on a spatial network.
However, the bounds derived from the space-time prism are rather loose,
resulting in unnecessarily extensive post-processing manual effort. To address
these limitations, we propose a Time Slicing-based Gap-Aware Rendezvous
Detection (TGARD) algorithm to tighten the spatial bounds in spatial networks.
We propose a Dual Convergence TGARD (DC-TGARD) algorithm to improve
computational efficiency using a bi-directional pruning approach. Theoretical
results show the proposed spatial bounds on the area of possible rendezvous are
tighter than that from related work (space-time prism). Experimental results on
synthetic and real-world spatial networks (e.g., road networks) show that the
proposed DC-TGARD is more scalable than the TGARD algorithm.

matching problem, which searches for the occurrences of substrings in a text
that have the same palindromic structure with a pattern. Given a text $T$ of
length $n$ over an alphabet of size $\sigma$, an index for pal-matching is to
support, given a pattern $P$ of length $m$, counting queries that compute the
number $\mathsf{occ}$ of the occurrences of $P$ and locating queries that
compute the occurrences of $P$. The authors in~[I et al., Theor. Comput. Sci.,
2013] proposed $O(n \lg n)$-bit data structure to support counting queries in
$O(m \lg \sigma)$ time and locating queries in $O(m \lg \sigma + \mathsf{occ})$
time. In this paper, we propose an FM-index type index for pal-matching
problem, which we call PalFM-index, that occupies $2n \lg \min(\sigma, \lg n) +
2n + o(n)$ bits of space and supports counting queries in $O(m)$ time.
PalFM-index can support locating queries in $O(m + \Delta \mathsf{occ})$ time
by adding $\frac{n}{\Delta} \lg n + n + o(n)$ bits of space, where $\Delta$ is
a parameter chosen from $1 \le \Delta \le n$.

<p>This survey is targeted at complexity theorists who might enjoy reading about
how tools developed in arithmetic circuit complexity helped design (to the best
of our knowledge) a new family of structured matrices, which in turn seem
well-suited for applications in deep learning. However, we hope that folks
primarily interested in deep learning would also appreciate the connections to
complexity theory.

arbitrary multi-prover interactive proof systems, where the QMA(2) promise gap
scales exponentially with the number of bits of communication in the

<p><em>[Yet another <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/category/philosophizing/">“philosophizing”</a> post, but one with some actual numbers. –Boaz]</em></p>



<p>Recently there have been many debates on “artificial general intelligence” (AGI) and whether or not we are close to achieving it by scaling up our current AI systems. In this post, I’d like to make this debate a bit more quantitative by trying to understand what “scaling” would entail. The calculations are very rough – think of a post-it that is stuck on the back of an envelope. But I hope that this can be at least a starting point for making these questions more concrete.</p>



<p>The first problem is that there is no agreement on what “artificial general intelligence” means.  People use this term to mean anything between the following possibilities: </p>



<ol><li>Existence of a system that can meet benchmarks such as getting a perfect score on the SAT and IQ tests and passing a “Turing test.”  This is more or less the definition used by <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/4815/date-of-first-agi-according-to-forecasters/">Metaculus</a> (though they recently updated it to a <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/5121/date-of-general-ai/">stricter version</a>).</li><li>Existence of a system that can replace many humans in terms of economic productivity. For concreteness, say that it can function as an above-average worker in many industries. (To sidestep the issue of robotics, we can restrict our attention to remote-only jobs.)</li><li>Large-scale deployment of AI, replacing or radically changing the nature of work of a large fraction of people. </li><li>More extreme scenarios such as consciousness, malice, and super-intelligence. For example, a system that is conscious/sentient enough to be awarded human rights and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jun/12/google-engineer-ai-bot-sentient-blake-lemoine">its own attorney</a>, or malicious enough to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uMQ3cqWDPHhjtiesc/agi-ruin-a-list-of-lethalities">order DNA off the Internet, build a nanofactory to construct a diamondoid bacteria riding on miniature rockets, so they enter the bloodstream of all humans and kills everyone instantly, while not being detected</a>.</li></ol>



<p>I consider the first scenario– passing IQ tests or even a Turing test– more of a “parlor trick” than actual intelligence.  The history of artificial intelligence is one of <em>underestimating</em> future achievements on specific benchmarks, but also one of <em>overestimating</em> the broader implications of those benchmarks. Early AI researchers were not only wrong about how long it will take for a computer program to become the world chess champion, but they also wrongly assumed that such a program would have to be generally intelligent as well. In a 1970 interview, Minsky was <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065245808604088">quoted</a> as saying that by the end of the 1970s, <em>“we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being … able to read Shakespeare, grease a car, play office politics, tell a joke, have a fight. At that point, the machine will begin to educate itself with fantastic speed. In a few months, it will be at genius level, and a few months after, its powers will be incalculable…  In the interests of efficiency, cost-cutting, and speed of reaction, the Department of Defense may well be forced more and more to surrender human direction of military policies to machines.”</em> </p>



<p>Brooks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox">explains</a> that early AI researchers thought intelligence was “best characterized as the things that highly educated male scientists found challenging.” Since playing championship-level chess was hard for them, they couldn’t imagine a machine doing it without doing all other tasks that they considered more trivial. Getting a high SAT or IQ exam score is no more meaningful (for machines or humans) than doing well in chess. </p>



<p>The fourth scenario is, at the moment, too speculative for quantitative discussion and hence less appropriate for this post  (though see the addendum below).  We will focus on the second and third scenarios, which are necessary stepping stones for the more extreme fourth option. For the sake of concreteness, I will make the optimistic assumption that “scale is all you need” to achieve either of these scenarios. I will then try to see our best estimates on <strong>how much scale</strong> and <strong>at what cost</strong>.</p>



<p>The point of this post is not to argue that we will never achieve scenarios 2 or 3. Instead, it is to try to get quantitative estimates on challenges we would need to overcome to do so. I believe it is possible, but it would be more than just getting better hardware. </p>



<p>This is a long post. If I had to <strong>TL;DR</strong> it, I would say that we have significant uncertainty on how much scale we need for AGI. Scaling to 10-100 Trillion parameters may well get us to Scenario 2 or something near. Still, training and (potentially) inference costs may be prohibitive to achieving the reliability and generality needed for actual deployment. Some challenges we face include:</p>



<p><strong>(1)</strong> Maintaining long-term context without model size exploding.  </p>



<p><strong>(2)</strong> Making training more efficient, particularly finding ways to train N-sized models at a near-linear cost instead of quadratic in N.</p>



<p><strong>(3)</strong> Avoid running out of data, perhaps by using video/images and programmatically generated interactive simulations.</p>



<p><strong>(4)</strong> Handling multi-step interactions without the interaction going “off the rails” and without needing to scale policy/value gradients to an unfeasible number of interactions (perhaps by using smaller RL-trained “verifier models” to choose between options produced by a large statically-trained model). </p>



<p>This post is focused on quantitative issues rather than questions such as “consciousness” or the risks of AI. Those deserve a post of their own. See the addendum at the end for some more philosophical/speculative discussion.</p>

Some of these, including health care aides, nurses, and teachers, are unlikely to be replaced by AI soon. The quality of current AI is also not the bottleneck in replacing retail salespersons, cashiers, and fast-food and counter workers.   Similarly, jobs such as laborers and material movers, which involve physical work in constantly changing environments, are unlikely to be cost-effective to automatize in the near future. </figure>

<h3><strong>Initial notes</strong></h3>



<p>Since artificial intelligence exists in the virtual space, people often assume that we can clone it an arbitrary number of times. But modern AI systems have a highly non-trivial physical footprint. Current models require dozens of GPUs to store their parameters, and future ones would be even larger. Creating many copies of such systems is going to be challenging.</p>



<p>Another common assumption is that by Moore’s law, if we manage to build a system at the level of (say) a sixth-grader, then in a year, we would have a virtual Einstein. However, often performance on a metric scale with the <strong>logarithm</strong> of the number of parameters (e.g., see Big-bench and Parti figures). So, perhaps a better assumption is that if we manage to build a virtual sixth-grader, then the following year, we would have a virtual seventh-grader.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FAFhzz-aKnE_J6tYSgrt5PJSapIMUWZDWwdI-gqb1SwdKFE8TGQhcmNHWTXSt-SY4eKBDHbu-weP25MtVb8_FBu_cSCk1WAIoCkhsS_cQWMuLSxddSwgPN_it_4m1KP9SzH7IszegCZSVslxbg" alt="" /><strong>Figure:</strong> Performance of models on the BIG-bench tasks (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04615">Srivastava et al., 22</a>). Note that performance scales with the <strong>logarithm</strong> of the number of parameters. This is in contrast to power-law dependence on the number of parameters which is typically manifested for metrics that are close to saturation. For the JSON tasks, naive extrapolation from 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>11 </sup>suggests an improvement of about 4 points per order of magnitude. However, the rapid growth exhibited by PaLM models suggests potentially better improvements. Jascha Sohl-Dikstein’s rough estimate is that 1-10 Trillion parameters would suffice for achieving expert performance in 80% of the tasks.</figure>

<p></p>



<h2><strong>If scale is all you need, how much scale will we need?</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s assume that we could reach the second scenario (proof of concept general AI system) by simply scaling up our current auto-regressive language models by a factor of X. What would be X?</p>



<p><strong>Adaptivity. </strong>One crucial difference between the tasks we currently test language models on and general intelligence is <em>adaptivity</em>. A model that answers a question correctly with 95% probability is excellent. But with a 5% chance of error, such a model may go “off the rails” in a back-and-forth conversation with more than 20 steps. Adaptivity is one reason why robotics performance (even in <a href="https://svl.stanford.edu/igibson/">simulated virtual worlds</a>) still lags far behind humans. It is not so much that the physical environment is higher dimensional than the inputs to language models, but the fact that robots’ actions impact it (and unlike in the case of Chess, Go, or Atari, we don’t have an unlimited number of restarts and simulations). Navigating the social and technical environment of (even a virtual) workplace is no less challenging. Squeezing out that final performance (e.g., from 95% to 99%) is usually when power laws kick in, reducing error by a factor of k, requiring a multiplicative overhead of k to some power a&gt;1.</p>



<p><strong>Context length.</strong> Another way to think of scaling is the length of the context window models keep.  To be useful in replacing a human worker, we don’t want to continuously simulate their first day at work. We want an employee that remembers what they did yesterday, last week, and last year. GPT-3 maintains a window of 2048 tokens, corresponding to roughly 1500 words or three pages of text. However, if you had to write a letter to your future self detailing everything they should remember from your interactions so far, it would likely be much longer. (Claude Fredericks, who may have been <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/11/08/the-most-ambitious-diary-in-history-claude-fredericks">the most prolific diarist in history</a>, wrote a diary of approximately 65,000 pages.) </p>



<p>Unfortunately, in standard transformer models, computation and memory cost <em>quadratically</em> with the context (though due to weight-sharing between different tokens, the number of learned parameters doesn’t have to increase), which means that increasing the context by (say) a factor of 100 will require increasing model size by a factor of 10,000. However, several <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06732">alternative transformer architectures</a> aim to achieve linear or near-linear model size scaling with the context.</p>



<p><strong>Empirical scaling of performance.</strong> The recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04615">BIG-bench paper</a> is perhaps the most comprehensive study of how large language models’ performance improves with scale. They assembled an extensive collection of tasks, each with a score normalized to (mostly) stay in the interval 0-100, with a score of zero corresponding to trivial (e.g., random) performance and a score of 100 corresponding to near-perfect performance (e.g., expert human). In many of these tasks, current models score lower than 20. We still don’t have enough data to know how truly large models behave. On the one hand, naive extrapolation suggests that we need many orders of magnitude for high performance (e.g., a score of 80 points or above). On the other hand, larger models such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311">Google PaLM</a> show evidence of “breakthrough capabilities”- performance growing super-linearly in the logarithm of size. It seems that to solve this benchmark fully, we would need at least a factor of 10 increase over the ½ Trillion parameter PaLM model.</p>



<p><strong>Comparing with the brain.</strong> Another point of comparison could be the human brain. However, human brains and artificial neural networks have very different architectures, and we don’t know how many parameters correspond to a single neuron or synapse. Scott Alexander <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/somewhat-contra-marcus-on-ai-scaling?s=r">quotes</a> <a href="https://blog.piekniewski.info/2018/08/28/fun-numbers-about-the-brain/">this estimate</a> of 100 trillion parameters on the brain’s size, which would correspond to a factor of 100-1,000 larger than current models. However, the estimate is rather hand-wavy, and even if it wasn’t, there is no reason to expect that artificial neural networks would have the same “ability per parameter” ratio as human brains. In particular, artificial neural networks appear to compensate for relatively weaker reasoning skills by ingesting a massive amount of data, and with data, the model size grows as well.</p>



<p><strong>Bottom line.</strong> Overall, it seems that X will need to be at least 10-100, though this is an extremely rough estimate. Also, while an X Trillion model might be the “core” of a system replacing a human worker, it will not be the whole of it, and we are likely to need new ideas beyond scale for these other components. In particular, a model designed for back-and-forth interaction is unlikely to simply use an auto-regressive language model as a black box, not even with chain-of-thought reasoning.</p>



<h2><strong>How much will it cost?</strong></h2>



<p>Suppose that scaling our current models by a factor of X can achieve “AGI” in the sense of yielding a system that can be as productive as humans in a wide variety of professions (say all the top remote jobs in the list from <a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/10-best-telecommuting-jobs-with-no-location-requirement-v2/">FlexJobs</a>). How much do we expect it to cost to (1) build a single system of this magnitude and (2) widely deploy it?</p>



<p>The gap between a “proof of concept” to actual deployment can be pretty significant. For example, in 2007, CMU won the urban DARPA grand challenge, while in 2012, a Google autonomous car passed a driving test. Yet a decade later, we still don’t have a significant deployment of self-driving cars. Also, as described in the book (and film) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/books/on-being-black-female-math-whizzes-during-the-space-race.html">Hidden Figures</a>, despite Moore’s law starting in the 30s, NASA still employed <a href="https://www.history.com/news/human-computers-women-at-nasa">human computers</a> until the 1960s. </p>



<p>For this post, I will make the optimistic (and unrealistic) assumption that the difference between proof-of-concept and deployments corresponds to the difference between the cost of <strong>training</strong> a system vs. the cost of doing <strong>inference</strong> on it.  If a system costs more than $100B to train, then it may never get built  (for comparison, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2012/07/05/how-much-does-it-cost-to-find-a-higgs-boson/?sh=15872c173948">Large Hadron Collider</a> cost less than $5B to build). Similarly, a system costing $1000/hour to use is unlikely to replace human workers at scale. </p>

<p></p>



<p>The costs below are calculated with today’s dollars and today’s hardware. Of course, improvements in hardware will translate to cheaper training and inference. However, we have neglected costs that can scale super-linearly with model size, including communication between nodes, managing massive clusters and more. I consider only <em>amortized</em> costs since those are what matter when training and serving models at scale.</p>



<h3><strong>Cost of training</strong></h3>



<p>There is no point in training a large model if you don’t train it for enough time. The performance advantages of larger models are realized by allowing them to train on more data without “saturating”. In the words of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556">Chinchilla</a> paper  “for every doubling of model size the number of training tokens should also be doubled.” (See also the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08127">deep bootstrap</a> paper). Hence the number of inferences applied using training also scales with the model size.  This means that if a model grows by a factor of X then both the cost of a single inference as well as the total number of inferences grow by about X, meaning that the cost of training grows by about X<sup>2</sup>.  In particular, we can expect training a model that is 100 times as large to cost 10,000 times more! </p>



<p>There are <a href="https://lambdalabs.com/blog/demystifying-gpt-3/">differing</a> <a href="https://lastweekin.ai/p/gpt-3-is-no-longer-the-only-game#:~:text=Taken%20together%2C%20these%20factors%20mean,costly%20and%20difficult%20to%20train.">estimates</a> on how much ~100B parameter GPT3 model cost to train, but they range in the $5M-$20M, let’s say $5M in pure training costs for simplicity. (This would correspond to a cost of 5M$/500B = 10<sup>-5</sup> dollars per inference, which matches roughly with estimates below.)  An X Trillion model (which, like Chinchilla, but unlike PaLM, would be fully trained to max out its advantages) might cost a factor of 100X<sup>2</sup> more. For X=10, this would be a cost of $50B. For X=100, this would be 5 Trillion dollars!</p>



<p>Clearly, finding a way to train N-sized models on N tokens using less than O(N<sup>2</sup>) steps (e.g., O(N log N) ) can be crucial for scaling larger models. Training larger language models also runs into the problem that we have nearly “maxed out” the available textual data. Modern models are already trained on hundreds of billions of words, but there is a limit to how much novel text can be produced by a planet of 8 billion people. (Though multimodal models that are also trained on video would have access to much more data.)</p>



<h2><strong>Cost per inference</strong></h2>



<p>Suppose that we have managed to train a large model of X Trillion parameters. How much do we expect inference to cost in dollars? In transformer architectures, the number of floating-point operations required to make a single model evaluation (i.e., inference) is roughly the same as the number of parameters.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6nN6SrxuKUYnW0cfxrOmcohET_FSmDrQqnQXNirPRwj95oAr0HAf6J6q6v_S8W4_gV6Efvu8fgflohbxbW66hjcmeOBzHKYK_6syfh0Sc19V0qVr_Sg7jaDICeEyM5U1tc4r2P1C6p38LJoWKQ" alt="" /><strong>Figure:</strong> Relation between the number of parameters and FLOPs, from  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05472">Desislavov et al</a>. Both axes are logarithmic. For transformers, the slope is very close to 1 (one FLOP per parameter), while for CNN’s it is roughly 0.8. </figure>



<p></p>



<p>Hence an X Trillion parameter model requires about X TerraFLOPs (TFLOPs). Nvidia’s A-100 GPUs claims peak performance of <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ampere-architecture-in-depth/">about 300</a> TFLOP/s. (The effects of using 16-bit precision and not achieving 100% utilization roughly cancel out.) Renting such a machine costs about $1/hour, so we can get about 300*3600 ~ 1M TFLOPs per dollar.  (This is up to order of magnitude and caring just about total FLOPs rather than wall-clock time; for careful calculations of inference <em>time,</em> see <a href="https://kipp.ly/blog/transformer-inference-arithmetic/">Carol Chen’s</a> and <a href="https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/how-fast-can-we-perform-a-forward-pass/">Jacob Steinhardt’s</a> blogs.)</p>



<p>So far, this sounds great – we could make 10<sup>6</sup>/X<strong> </strong> inferences per dollar for an X trillion parameter model.  However, in the real world costs are much higher. The same Nvidia blog shows that A-100 can handle 6000 inferences/sec of the 340M parameter Bert Large. Since an X Trillion model is 3000X larger, that would correspond to 2/X inferences per second or 7200/X inferences per hour/dollar. The calculations above predict that the 0.2 Trillion parameter GPT-3 would be able to perform 7200*5~35K inferences per dollar. However, OpenAI charges <a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing/">6 cents per 1K tokens</a> (including input tokens!), which depending on the length of the input, can be only 10 inferences per dollar. <a href="https://pakodas.substack.com/p/estimating-gpt3-api-cost">Bhavsar</a> estimates GPT-3 can handle about 18K inferences per GPU hour. Overall it seems that 10<sup>4</sup>/X inferences per dollar is an optimistic estimate. </p>



<p>However, the question is how many inferences we need to make per hour to simulate a human. The average person <a href="https://www.publicationcoach.com/ten-ways-to-write-a-better-speech/">apparently speaks</a> about 150 words (say 200 tokens) per minute. This would suggest we need about 200*60 ~ 10K inferences per hour to simulate a person. For an X Trillion sized model, that would cost $X per hour, which is not too bad if X is between 10 to 100.</p>



<p>The above price point sounds pretty good but will likely be an underestimate.  First, to actually simulate a human, we need not just to simulate what they say but also what they <em>think</em>. So, to perform “chain of thought” reasoning, we would need to run an inference per word that is thought rather than a word that is uttered. We don’t know the speed of thought, but it will increase the number of inferences needed. Generally, to simulate a chain of reasoning of depth K, the number of inferences scales with K, even if the end result is just a single token. Second, to reach high reliability, it is likely that we will need to make Y inferences and use some mechanism to choose the best one out of these Y options. For example, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07814">AlphaCode</a> generates millions of possible solutions to programming challenges and filters them into 10 candidate ones. It is hard to estimate what Y would be in a workplace environment, but it seems that Y would be somewhere between 10 to 100.</p>



<p><strong>Bottom line for inference cost. </strong>The estimates above suggest that an X Trillion parameter model would require about 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> inferences per hour to simulate a person, with a cost that ranges from $10X to $100X per hour. This is already tight for X=10 and would be too much for X=100. However, it is not clear how many words/thoughts we need to simulate per given profession, so these estimates are very rough.</p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2>



<p>While the estimates above should be taken with huge grains of salt, I believe that generally useful artificial intelligence can likely be achieved, but it will require more than sheer scale. While in principle a perfect next-word extender is also a perfect reinforcement learner, we may not be able to get close enough to perfection by scale alone. More than any particular conclusions, I hope that the debate can move from general philosophical arguments to quantitative questions that have numerical answers. </p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>Addendum: The “C word” and existential risk.</strong></h2>



<p>I tried to keep this post within the realms of calculations and away from philosophy. But given recent discussions and hype on whether AI systems can achieve “consciousness” or “sentience” and whether they pose a unique existential risk, I feel that I must address this at least briefly.  Readers allergic to philosophy and unjustified speculations can stop here. </p>



<p>Consciousness is a tricky concept: the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry lists <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/#SpeTheCon">nine different specific theories</a> of consciousness, and there are more theories still. It is also intertwined with ethics: if we consider a creature to be conscious or sentient, then the boundaries of how we can treat it become an issue of ethics. I don’t think it’s the job of computer scientists (or any other scientists) to come up with a moral philosophy, and similarly, I don’t think defining consciousness falls in our domain.</p>



<p>Historically, there seem to be two kinds of non-human entities which we considered conscious or sentient. One is animals, to which people have felt superior. The other is gods, to which people have felt inferior. Before we understood the causes of planetary movements, weather events, and other natural phenomena, we ascribed them to conscious actions by various gods. Since we couldn’t predict or explain these phenomena, our only attempt at controlling them was through prayer and sacrifice to the presumably conscious entity that controls them.</p>



<p>Some discussions of potential future AI are reminiscent of those past gods. According to some, AI would be not just conscious but capricious and could (according to some, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uMQ3cqWDPHhjtiesc/agi-ruin-a-list-of-lethalities">would</a>)  ensure that “everybody on the face of the Earth suddenly falls over dead within the same second.” It is of course, possible to construct hypothetical scenarios in which an AI system managed to start a nuclear war or design a lethal virus. We’ve all read such books and seen such movies. It is also possible to construct scenarios where <em>humans</em> start a nuclear war or design a lethal virus. There are also many books and movies of the latter type. In fact, many AI “doomsday scenarios” don’t seem to require super-human levels of intelligence.   </p>



<p>The truth is that the reason that our world hasn’t been destroyed so far is not that humans were not intelligent enough nor because we haven’t been malicious enough. First, throughout most of human history, we did not have technologies such as nuclear weapons and others with the potential to cause planet-scale destruction. Second, while imperfect, we have developed some institutions, including international bodies, the non-proliferation treaty, standards for biolabs, pandemic preparations, and more to keep some of these capabilities in check. Third, we were lucky. From climate change through pandemic preparation to nuclear disarmament, humanity should be doing much more to confront the risks and harms of our own making. But this is true independently of artificial intelligence. Just as with humans, my inclination with AI would not to try to make systems inherently moral or good (“aligned” in AI-speak) but rather use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify">“trust, but verify” </a>approach. One moral of computational complexity theory is that computationally weak agents can verify the computation of more powerful processes.</p>



<p>Many of the calculations above show how “scaling up” is going to be non-trivial, and it is unlikely to see AI making restaurant reservations one day, and secretly ordering material over the net to build a world-destroying nano-technology lab the next one. Even if it’s possible for a large-scale model to “train itself” to improve performance, without needing additional outside data, that model would still incur the considerable computational costs for training that we computed above. </p>



<p>In my previous post, I explained <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2022/05/23/why-i-am-not-a-longtermist/">why I am not a “longtermist”</a>.  The above is why I don’t view an “AGI run amok” as a short-term existential risk. That doesn’t mean AI doesn’t have safety issues. AI is a new technology, and with any new technology come new risks. We don’t need science fiction to see real risks in both unintentional consequences of AI deployment such as discrimination and bias, as well as intentional consequences of deploying AI for weapons, surveillance, and social manipulation. I don’t think that debating the notion of consciousness and inventing doomsday scenarios is helpful for combatting any one of those.   </p>

<div class="content">
<p>The second preprint from my CCCG papers is now online. It is “Reflections in an octagonal mirror maze”, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11413">arXiv:2206.11413</a>. The title is quite literal: suppose you find yourself in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_mirrors">mirror maze</a>, where the mirrors are aligned with the sides of an octagon, and have integer coordinates (meaning that, on a floorplan of the maze, the mirrors become line segments between points of an integer grid). What would you see if you looked in any given direction? It might be many reflections eventually leading to the back of your own head, to the exit, or some other non-reflective part of the maze. <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mirror_Maze_in_the_Museum_of_Science%2BIndustry_of_Chicago.jpg">The example below, from the Museum of Science &amp; Industry in Chicago</a>, is hexagonal rather than octagonal, but otherwise has much the same effect:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/Chicago-mirror-maze.jpg" alt="Mirror Maze in the Museum of Science+Industry of Chicago, CC-BY-SA image by Kevdog686, 27 May 2019, from Wikimedia Commons" /></p>

<p>In this example, it looks like you might be seeing something else, not the exit or your own head: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_mirror">a corridor of infinitely many reflections</a>. But when looking in a direction of rational slope, and without tricks involving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_mirror">one-way mirrors</a> (my guess at what’s happening in the photo), that’s not actually possible. Rationality implies that there are only finitely many possible points where your view could hit a mirror: in the photo above, all the reflections down the corridor look like they are actually on the center lines of the mirrors. Because there are only finitely many of these points (in reality, if not in what you see), such a view would have to eventually repeat, in a finite cycle. And finite cycles like that are definitely possible, but you can’t see them, because putting your eye onto them blocks the view.</p>

<p>Even if you can’t see a line with infinitely many reflections, you can see a very large number of them. The number of reflections you see between your eye and whatever opaque thing eventually blocks the view cannot be bounded by any function of the number of mirrors. If you take a diagonal view into a long hallway with its two sides mirrored, the number of reflections will be proportional to the length of the hall, even though there are only two mirrors. And with larger numbers of mirrors, more complex patterns of reflection can occur.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/8reflex.svg" alt="Complex patterns of reflection in an octagonal mirror maze" /></p>

<p>Because the number of reflections can be large, finding the eventual fate of a reflected light path by directly simulating the sequence of reflections any ray might take could be very slow. Instead, my new paper shows that it can be done in polynomial time! More precisely the time is polynomial in the number of mirrors and in the number of bits needed to specify a mirror coordinates or viewpoint direction using binary numbers.</p>

<p>Although the problem is simple to state, the solution uses sophisticated methods from computational topology. It’s an application of <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2022/01/30/fast-iterated-exchange.html">an idea from an earlier post</a>, originally by Mark Bell, and included in an update to my earlier preprint “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11607">The Complexity of Iterated Reversible Computation</a>”. This idea concerns <em>iterated integer interval exchange transformations</em>: if you have a function on an interval of integers that acts by permuting subintervals, then how easy is it to compute the result of applying the same function many times? As Bell observed, this computation could be transformed into an equivalent problems of tracing normal curves on a topological surface, which had been solved in earlier work by Erickson and Nayyeri. The new paper generalizes these integer transformations to partial functions, extends the same method to compute iterated values of these partial functions, and shows that these partial functions can be used to model the way the mirrors in a mirror maze permute sightlines.</p>

<p>In 1973, the US Supreme Court enshrined the right to abortion—considered by me and ~95% of everyone I know to be a basic pillar of modernity—in such a way that the right could be overturned only if its opponents could somehow gain permanent minority rule, and thereby disregard the wills of three-quarters of Americans.  So now, half a century later, that’s precisely what they’ve done.  Because Ruth Bader Ginsburg didn’t live three more weeks, we’re now faced with a civilizational crisis, with tens of millions of liberals and moderates in the red states now under the authority of a social contract that they never signed.  With this backwards leap, Curtis Yarvin’s notion that <a href="https://leviathan-supersystem.tumblr.com/post/164980251514/what-does-the-nrx-meme-cthulhu-swims-left-mean">“Cthulhu only ever swims leftward”</a> stands as decimated by events as any thesis has ever been.  I wonder whether Yarvin is happy to have been so thoroughly refuted.</p>



<p>Most obviously for me, the continued viability of Texas as a place for science, for research, for technology companies, is now in severe doubt.  Already this year, our 50-member CS department at UT Austin has had faculty members leave, and faculty candidates turn us down, with abortion being the stated reason, and I expect that to accelerate.  Just last night my wife, Dana Moshkovitz, presented a proposal at the STOC business meeting to host STOC’2024 at a beautiful family-friendly resort outside Austin.  The proposal failed, in part because of the argument that, if a pregnant STOC attendee faced a life-threatening medical condition, Texas doctors might choose to let her die, or the attendee might be charged with murder for having a miscarriage.  In other words: Texas (and indeed, half the US) will apparently soon be like Donetsk or North Korea, dangerous for Blue Americans to visit even for just a few days.  To my fellow Texans, I say: if you find that hyperbolic, <em>understand that this is how the blue part of the country now sees you</em>.  Understand that only a restoration of the previous social contract can reverse it.</p>



<p>Of course, this destruction of everything some of us have tried to build in science in Texas is happening despite the fact that 47-48% of Texans actually vote Democratic.  It’s happening despite the fact that, if Blue Americans wanted to stop it, the obvious way to do so would be to <strong>move to Austin and Houston (and the other blue enclaves of red states) in droves, and exert their electoral power.</strong>  In other words, to do precisely what Dana and I did.  But can I urge others to do the same with a straight face?</p>



<p>As far as I can tell, the only hope at this point of averting a cold Civil War is if, against all odds, there’s a Democratic landslide in Congress, sufficient to get the right to abortion enshrined into federal law.  Given the ways both the House and the Senate are stacked against Democrats, I don’t expect that anytime soon, but I’ll work for it—and will do so even if many of the people I’m working with me despise me for other reasons.  I will match reader donations to Democratic PACs and Congressional campaigns (not necessarily the same ones, though feel free to advocate for your favorites), announced in the comment section of this post, up to a limit of $10,000.</p></div>

We make progress on understanding a lower bound technique that was recently used by the authors to prove the first superpolynomial constant-depth circuit lower bounds against algebraic circuits. 

More specifically, our previous work applied the well-known partial derivative method in a new setting, that of 'lopsided' set-multilinear polynomials. A set-multilinear polynomial $P\in F[X_1,\ldots,X_d]$ (for disjoint sets of variables $X_1,\ldots,X_d$) is a linear combination of monomials, each of which contains one variable from $X_1,\ldots,X_d$. A lopsided space of set-multilinear polynomials is one where the sets $X_1,\ldots,X_d$ are allowed to have different sizes (we use the adjective `lopsided' to stress this feature). By choosing a suitable lopsided space of polynomials, and using a suitable version of the partial-derivative method for proving lower bounds, we were able to prove constant-depth superpolynomial set-multilinear formula lower bounds even for very low-degree polynomials (as long as $d$ is a growing function of the number of variables $N$). This in turn implied lower bounds against general formulas of constant-depth.

A priori, there is nothing stopping these techniques from giving us lower bounds against algebraic formulas of 'any' depth. We investigate the extent to which this lower bound can extend to greater depths. We prove the following results.


** We observe that our choice of the lopsided space and the kind of partial-derivative method used can be modelled as the choice of a multiset $W\subseteq [-1,1]$ of size $d$. Our first result completely characterizes, for any product-depth $\Delta,$ the best lower bound we can prove for set-multilinear formulas of product-depth $\Delta$ in terms of some combinatorial properties of $W$, that we call the 'depth-$\Delta$ tree bias' of $W$.

** We show that the maximum depth-$3$ tree bias, over multisets $W$ of size $d$, is $\Theta(d^{1/4}).$ This shows a stronger formula lower bound of $N^{\Omega(d^{1/4})}$ for set-multilinear formulas of product-depth $3$, and also puts a non-trivial constraint on the best lower bounds we can hope to prove at this depth in this framework (a priori, we could have hoped to prove a lower bound of $N^{\Omega(\Delta d^{1/\Delta})}$ at product-depth $\Delta$).

** Finally, we show that for small $\Delta,$ our proof technique cannot hope to prove lower bounds of the form $N^{\Omega(d^{1/\poly(\Delta)})}.$ This seems to strongly hint that new ideas will be required to prove lower bounds for formulas of unbounded depth.</div>

<div class="content">
<p>In <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2022/04/03/dissection-into-rectangles.html">a recent post</a>, I discussed dissection of orthogonal polygons into each other by axis-parallel cuts, translation, and gluing. Each polygon has a value associated with it, called its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehn_invariant">Dehn invariant</a>, that cannot be changed by dissection, so two polygons that can be dissected into each other must have equal invariants. And for past usage of Dehn invariants, that was pretty much all we looked at: are they equal or not? But my post pointed out that these invariants actually have a lot of structure (you can think of them as matrices, after an arbitrary choice of basis) and this structure is geometrically meaningful. Matrices (or tensors) have a rank, and the rank of the Dehn invariant is a lower bound on  the number of rectangles into which a polygon can be dissected. This in turn has implications on the ability of a polygon or its dissections to tile the plane.</p>

<p>Now it’s a paper: “Orthogonal dissection into few rectangles”, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10675">arXiv:2206.10675</a>, to appear at CCCG. The results of the paper are stronger: instead of just using the Dehn rank as a lower bound, I proved that it always equals the minimum number of rectangles into which a given polygon can be dissected, and can be used to compute this number of rectangles efficiently. The two main steps of the proof are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>constructing a set of the right number of rectangles for any given tensor, by a direct geometric construction that turns an algebraic realization of the rank (a combination of positive and negative rectangles) into a geometric representation without the negativity, and</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>finding a dissection for any two polygons with equal invariants, by induction on the dimensions of the matrix describing their invariants.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/dehn-dissectability.svg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Induction step for proving the existence of a dissection between polygons with equal Dehn invariants" /></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The images above are taken from the illustrations for the proofs of these two results from the paper, and maybe will provide a little insight into how they might be proven. For details, see the paper. Instead, here, I wanted to highlight a different, related problem, that I wasn’t able to prove as much about.</p>

<p>Mostly when mathematicians talk about Dehn invariants, it’s for 3d dissections: cutting polyhedra up along planes, translating and rotating the pieces, and gluing them back together. The 3d Dehn invariant combines lengths and angles of polyhedron edges in the same way that the 2d invariant combines widths and heights of rectangles. Therefore, 3d Dehn rank is a lower bound on the number of edges you can dissect something into. It’s easy to construct polyhedra with arbitrarily large rank, and these polyhedra are forced to have arbitrarily large numbers of edges, no matter how you try to cut them up and reassemble them.</p>

<p>However, the 3d Dehn rank is not exactly equal to the minimum number of edges after dissection. A cube has Dehn invariant zero (with rank zero), but the minimum number of edges of a polyhedron you can dissect it into is four, for a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2689983">space-filling tetrahedron</a> of the same volume. A regular tetrahedron is not space-filling, has a Dehn invariant of rank one, and already has the minimum number of edges among anything you can dissect it into. In both cases the rank is unequal to the minimum number of edges. Also, the rank is different in these cases but the minimum number of edges is the same.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I was hoping that the rank of the Dehn invariant would be usable as a constant-factor approximation to the minimum number of edges after dissection. To prove this, I’d need to find a polyhedron, having the same Dehn invariant as any given polyhedron, but with a number of edges proportional to the rank. The existence of a dissection would then follow from known results. But finding this few-edge polyhedron would have to use some knowledge of the starting polyhedron (unlike my set-of-rectangles construction), because not all tensors are realizable as Dehn invariants. So far, I haven’t been able to find any construction of these few-edge polyhedra.</p>

<p>So: does every polyhedron, of Dehn rank \(r\), have an equivalent polyhedron with \(O(r)\) edges? Or are there some polyhedra that cannot be dissected into another polyhedron with few edges, even though their Dehn invariants have low rank?</p>

<p>In this instalment of the Process Algebra Diary, <a href="http://math.umons.ac.be/staff/Randour.Mickael/" target="_blank">Mickael Randour</a> and I joined forces to interview <a href="https://luca.dealfaro.com/" target="_blank">Luca de Alfaro</a>, <a href="http://wpage.unina.it/m.faella/" target="_blank">Marco Faella</a>, <a href="https://pub.ist.ac.at/~tah/" target="_blank">Thomas A. Henzinger</a>, <a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rupak/" target="_blank">Rupak Majumdar</a> and <a href="https://wwwhome.ewi.utwente.nl/~marielle/" target="_blank">Mariëlle Stoelinga</a>, who are some of the recipients of the <a href="https://concur2022.mimuw.edu.pl/tot-award/" target="_blank">CONCUR 2022 Test-of-Time award</a>. We hope that you'll enjoy reading the very inspiring and insightful answers provided by the above-mentioned colleagues to our questions.  <br /></p><p>Note: In what follows, "Luca A." refers to me, whereas "Luca" is Luca de Alfaro. <br /></p><p><b>Luca A. and Mickael:</b> You receive the CONCUR ToT Award 2022 for your paper  "<a href="https://pub.ist.ac.at/~tah/Publications/the_element_of_surprise_in_timed_games.pdf)" target="_blank">The Element of Surprise in Timed Games</a>", which appeared at CONCUR 2003. In that article, you studied concurrent, two-player timed games. A key contribution of your paper is the definition of an elegant timed game model, allowing both the representation of moves that can take the opponent by surprise, as they are played “faster”, and the definition of natural concepts of winning conditions for the two players — ensuring that players can win only by playing according to a physically meaningful strategy. In our opinion, this is a great example of how novel concepts and definitions can advance a research field. Could you tell us more about the origin of your model?</p><p><br /><b>All: </b>Mariëlle and Marco were postdocs with Luca at UCSC in that period, Rupak was a student of Tom's, and we were all in close touch, meeting very often to work together.  We all had worked much on games, and an extension to timed games was natural for us to consider. </p><p><br />In untimed games, players propose a move, and the moves jointly determine the next game state. In these games there is no notion of real-time.  We wanted to study games in which players could decide not only the moves, but also the instant in time when to play them.</p><p><br />In timed automata, there is only one “player” (the automaton), which can take either a transition, or a time step.  The natural generalization would be a game in which players could propose either a move, or a time step.</p><p><br />Yet, we were unsatisfied with this model. It seemed to us that it was different to say “Let me wait 14 seconds and reconvene.  Then, let me play my King of Spades” or “Let me play my King of Spades in 14 seconds”. In the first, by stopping after 14 seconds, the player is providing a warning that the card might be played. In the second, there is no such warning.  In other words, if players propose either a move or a time-step, they cannot take the adversary by surprise with a move at an unanticipated instant.  We wanted a model that could capture this element of surprise.</p><p><br />To capture the element of surprise, we came up with a model in which players propose both a move and the delay with which it is played. After this natural insight, the difficulty was to find the appropriate winning condition, so that a player could not win by stopping time. </p><p><br /><b>Tom:</b> Besides the infinite state space (region construction etc.), a second issue that is specific to timed systems is the divergence of time. Technically, divergence is a built-in Büchi condition ("there are infinitely many clock ticks"), so all safety and reachability questions about timed systems are really co-Büchi and Büchi questions, respectively.  This observation had been part of my work on timed systems since the early 1990s, but it has particularly subtle consequences for timed games, where no player (and no collaboration of players) should have the power to prevent time from diverging.  This had to be kept in mind during the exploration of the modeling space.</p><p><br /><b>All:</b> We came up with many possible winning conditions, and for each we identified some undesirable property, except for the one that we published.  This is in fact an aspect that did not receive enough attention in the paper; we presented the chosen winning condition, but we did not discuss in full detail why several other conditions that might have seemed plausible did not work.</p><p><br />In the process of analyzing the winning conditions, we came up with many interesting games, which form the basis of many results, such as the result on lack of determinazation, on the need for memory in reachability games (even when clock values are part of the state), and most famously as it gave the title to the paper, on the power of surprise.</p><p><br />After this fun ride came the hard work, where we had to figure out how to solve these games. We had worked at symbolic approaches to games before, and we followed the approach here, but there were many complex technical adaptations required. When we look at the paper in the distance of time, it has this combination of a natural game model, but also of a fairly sophisticated solution algorithm.</p><p><br /><b>Luca A. and Mickael: </b>Did any of your subsequent research build explicitly on the results and the techniques you developed in your award-winning paper? If so, which of your subsequent results on (timed) games do you like best? Is there any result obtained by other researchers that builds on your work and that you like in particular or found surprising?</p><p><br /><b>Luca:</b> Marco and I built Ticc, which was meant to be a tool for timed interface theories, based largely on the insights in this paper.  The idea was to be able to check the compatibility of real-time systems, and automatically infer the requirements that enable two system components to work well together – to be compatible in time.  We thought this would be useful for hardware or embedded systems, and especially for control systems, and in fact the application is important: there is now much successful work on the compositionality of StateFlow/Simulink models.</p><p><br />We used MTBDDs as the symbolic engine, and Marco and I invented a language for describing the components and we wrote by pair-programming some absolutely beautiful Ocaml code that compiled real-time component models into MTBDDs (perhaps the nicest code I have ever written). The problem was that we were too optimistic in our approach to state explosion, and we were never able to study any system of realistic size.</p><p><br />After this, I became interested in games more in an economic setting, and from there I veered into incentive systems, and from there to reputation systems and to a three-year period in which I applied reputation systems in practice in industry, thus losing somewhat touch with formal methods work.</p><p><b>Marco:</b> I’ve kept working on games since the award-winning paper, in one way or another. The closest I’ve come to the timed game setting has been with controller synthesis games for hybrid automata. In a series of papers, we had fun designing and implementing symbolic algorithms that manipulate polyhedra to compute the winning region of a linear hybrid game. The experience gained on timed games helped me recognize the many subtleties arising in games played in real time on a continuous state-space. <br /></p><p><b>Mariëlle:</b> I have been working on games for test case generation: One player represents the tester, which chooses inputs to test; the other player represents the System-under-Test, and chooses the outputs of the system. Strategy synthesis algorithms can then compute strategies for the tester that maximize all kinds of objectives, eg reaching certain states, test coverage etc. </p><p><br />A result that I really like is that we were able to show a very close correspondence between the existing testing frameworks and game theoretic frameworks: Specifications act as game arenas; test cases are exactly game strategies, and the conformance relation used in testing (namely ioco) coincides with game refinement (i.e. alternating refinement). </p><p><br /><b>Rupak:</b> In an interesting way, the first paper on games I read was the <a href="https://www-verimag.imag.fr/~sifakis/RECH/Synth-MalerPnueli.pdf" target="_blank">one by Maler, Pnueli and Sifakis (STACS 95)</a> that had both fixpoint algorithms and timed games (without “surprise”). So the problem of symbolic solutions to games and their applications in synthesis followed me throughout my career. I moved to finding controllers for games with more general (non-linear) dynamics, where we worked on abstraction techniques. We also realized some new ways to look at restricted classes of adversaries. I was always fortunate to have very good collaborators who kept my interest alive with new insights. Very recently, I have gotten interested in games from a more economic perspective, where players can try to signal each other or persuade each other about private information but it’s too early to tell where this will lead.</p><p><br /><b>Luca A. and Mickael:</b> What are the research topics that you find most interesting right now? Is there any specific problem in your current field of interest that you'd like to see solved?</p><p><br /><b>Mariëlle: </b>Throughout my academic life, I have been working on stochastic analysis --- with Luca and Marco, we worked on stochastic games a lot. First only on theory, but later also on industrial applications, esp in the railroad and high-tech domain. At some point in time, I realized that my work was actually centred around analysing failure probabilities and risk. That is how I moved into risk analysis; the official title of the title of the chair I hold is Risk Management for High Tech Systems. </p><p><br />The nice thing is: this sells <i>much</i> better than Formal Methods! Almost nobody knows what Formal Methods are, and if they know, people think “yes, those difficult people who urge us to specify everything mathematically”. For risk management, this is completely different: everybody understands that this is an important area. <br /><br /><b>Luca: </b>I am currently working on computational ecology, on ML for networks, and on fairness in data and ML.  In computational ecology, we are working on the role of habitat and territory for species viability. We use ML techniques to write “differentiable algorithms”, where we can compute the effect of each input – such as the kind of vegetation in each square-kilometer of territory – on the output.  If all goes well, this will enable us to efficiently compute which regions should be prioritized for protection and habitat conservation.</p><p><br />In networks, we have been able to show that reinforcement learning can yield tremendous throughput gains in wireless protocols, and we are now starting to work on routing and congestion control.</p><p><br />And in fairness and ML, we have worked on the automatic detection of anomalous data subgroups (something that can be useful in model diagnostics), and we are now working on the spontaneous inception of discriminatory behavior in agent systems.</p><p><br />While these do not really constitute a coherent research effort, I can certainly say that I am having a grand tour of CS – the kind of joy ride one can afford with tenure!</p><p><br /><b>Rupak: </b>I have veered between practical and theoretical problems. I am working on charting the decidability frontier for infinite-state model checking problems (most recently, for asynchronous programs and context-bounded reachability). I am also working on applying formal methods to the world of cyber-physical systems ---mostly games and synthesis. Finally, I have become very interested in applying formal methods to large scale industrial systems through a collaboration with Amazon Web Services. There is still a large gap between what is theoretically understood and what is practically applicable to these systems; and the problems are a mix of technical and social.</p><p><br /><b>Luca A. and Mickael:</b> You have a very strong track record in developing theoretical results and in applying them to real-life problems. In our, admittedly biased, opinion, your work exemplifies Ben Schneiderman's <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1802918115" target="_blank">Twin-Win Model</a>, which propounds the pursuit of "the dual goals of breakthrough theories in published papers and validated solutions that are ready for widespread dissemination." Could you say a few words on your research philosophy? How do you see the interplay between basic and applied research?</p><p><br /><b>Luca:</b> This is very kind for you to say, and a bit funny to hear, because certainly when I was young I had a particular talent for getting lost in useless theoretical problems.  </p><p><br />I think two things played in my favor.  One is that I am curious.  The other is that I have a practical streak: I still love writing code and tinkering with “things”, from IoT to biology to web and more.  This tinkering was at the basis of many of the works I did.  My work on reputation systems started when I created a wiki on cooking; people were vandalizing it, and I started to think about game theory and incentives for collaboration, which led to my writing much of the code for Wikipedia analysis, and at Google, for Maps edits analysis.  My work on networks started with me tinkering with simple reinforcement-learning schemes that might work, and writing the actual code. On the flip side, my curiosity too often had the better of me, so that I have been unable to pay the continuous and devoted attention to a single research field.  I am not a specialist in any single thing I do or I have done.  I am always learning the ropes of something I don’t quite know yet how to do.</p><p><br />My applied streak probably gave me some insight on which problems might be of more practical relevance, and my frequent field changes have allowed me to bring new perspectives to old problems.  There were not many people using RL for wireless networks, there are not many who write ML and GPU code and also avidly read about conservation biology.<br /><br /><b>Rupak:</b> I must say that Tom and Luca were very strong influencers for me in my research: both in problem selection and in appreciating the joy of research. I remember one comment of Tom, paraphrased as “Life is short. We should write papers that get read.” I spent countless hours in Luca’s office and learnt a lot of things about research, coffee, the ideal way to make pasta, and so on.<br /></p><p><b>Marco:</b> It was an absolute privilege to be  part of the group that wrote that paper (my 4th overall, according to  DBLP). I’d like to thank my coauthors, and Luca in particular, for  guiding me during those crucially formative years.</p><p><b>Mariëlle: </b>I fully agree! <br /></p><p><br /><b>Luca A. and Mickael:</b> Several of you have high-profile leadership roles at your institutions. What advice would you give to a colleague who is about to take up the role of department chair, director of a research centre, dean or president  of a university? How can one build a strong research culture, stay research active and live to tell the tale?</p><p><br /><b>Luca:</b> My colleagues may have better advice; my productivity certainly decreased when I was department chair, and is lower even now that I am the vice-chair.  <br />When I was young, I was ambitious enough to think that my scientific work would have the largest impact among the things I was doing.  But I soon realized that some of the greatest impact was on others: on my collaborators, on the students I advised, who went on to build great careers and stayed friends, and on all the students I was teaching.  This awareness serves to motivate and guide me in my administrative work. The CS department at UCSC is one of the ten largest in the number of students we graduate, and the time I spend on improving its organization and the quality of the education it delivers is surely very impactful.  My advice to colleagues is to consider their service not as an impediment to research, but as one of the most impactful things they do.</p><p><br />My way of staying alive is to fence off some days that I only dedicate to research (aside from some unavoidable emergency), and also, to have collaborators that give me such joy in working together that they brighten and energize my whole day. </p><p><br /><b>Luca A. and Mickael:</b> Finally, what advice would you give to a young researcher who is keen to start working on topics related to concurrency theory today?<br /> </p><p><b>Luca: </b>Oh that sounds very interesting!  And, may I show you this very interesting thing we are doing in Jax to model bird dispersal? We feed in this climate and vegetation data, and then we…</p><p><br />Just kidding.  Just kidding.  If I come to CONCUR I promise not to lead any of the concurrency yearlings astray.  At least I will try.</p><p><br />My main advice would be this: work on principles that allow correct-by-design development.  If you look at programming languages and software engineering, the progress in software productivity has not happened because people have become better at writing and debugging code written in machine language or C. It has happened because of the development of languages and software principles that make it easier to build large systems that are correct by construction.<br />We need the same kind of principles, (modeling) languages, and ideas to build correct concurrent systems.  Verification alone is not enough. Work on design tools, ideas to guide design, and design languages.</p><p><br /><b>Tom:</b> In concurrency theory we define formalisms and study their properties. Most papers do the studying, not the defining: they take a formalism that was defined previously, by themselves or by someone else, and study a property of that formalism, usually to answer a question that is inspired by some practical motivation. To me, this omits the most fun part of the exercise, the {\it defining} part. The point I am trying to make is not that we need more formalisms, but that, if one wishes to study a specific question, it is best to study the question on the simplest possible formalism that exhibits exactly the features that make the question meaningful. To do this, one often has to define that formalism. In other words, the formalism should follow the question, not the other way around. This principle has served me well again and again and led to formalisms such as timed games, which try to capture the essence needed to study the power of timing in strategic games played on graphs. So my advice to a young researcher in concurrency theory is: choose your formalism wisely and don't be afraid to define it. <br /><br /><b>Rupak:</b> Problems have different measures. Some are practically justified (“Is this practically relevant in the near future?”) and some are justified by the foundations they build (“Does this avenue provide new insights and tools?”). Different communities place different values on the two. But both kinds of work are important and one should recognize that one set of values is not universally better than the other.<br /></p><p><b>Mariëlle:</b> As Michael Jordan puts it: <i>Just play.

<p>This fall, I am once again teaching Harvard’s “Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science” course (<a href="https://cs121.boazbarak.org/">CS 121</a>). Like many “intro to TCS / intro to theory of computation” courses,  Harvard’s course used to be taught with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Michael-Sipser/dp/113318779X">Sipser’s classic textbook</a>. Sipser’s book is indeed, for better or worse, a classic. It is extremely well-written and students like it very much. It has clear explanations,  plenty of examples and solved exercises, and a wealth of material on the web accumulated through decades of it being used in many courses. On the other hand, CS in general and theoretical CS in particular has changed a lot in the 25+ years since the book was written. In fact, the basic approach of starting with finite automata as the initial model of computation dates to the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/1096945">1969 book</a> of Hopcroft and Ullman.</p>



<p>One of my main goals in revising the theoretical CS course is to give students both rigorous foundations as well as a taste of modern topics. Some of these modern topics: </p>



<ul><li><strong>Cryptography</strong>: a topic that combines mathematical beauty, practical importance, and a demonstration that sometimes computational hardness can be a resource rather than a hindrance.</li><li><strong>Quantum computing: </strong>a topic that shows the interaction between TCS and physics, the fundamental nature of the “Church Turing hypothesis”, and how we can (as in crypto) take a “lemon” (inability of classical computers to simulate certain quantum processes) and use it to make “lemonade” (a computer with stronger power than classical computers).</li><li><strong>Randomized computation and derandomization: </strong>Randomization is now essential to so many areas of CS, and so it is important to both demonstrate its power, and also how we might use complexity to remove it.</li><li><strong>Machine learning and average-case complexity:</strong> Traditionally in an intro TCS course the focus is purely on worst-case complexity. This leads to a disconnect with modern applications of CS, and in particular machine learning. </li></ul>



<p>So, I ended up <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2017/07/27/rethinking-the-intro-theory-course/">writing my own text</a> – <a href="https://introtcs.org/"><strong>Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science</strong></a>.  While at some point I hope to make it into a printed book, it will always be available freely online on <a href="https://introtcs.org/">https://introtcs.org/</a>. The markdown source for it is available on the repository <a href="https://github.com/boazbk/tcs">https://github.com/boazbk/tcs</a> .  I’ve benefitted greatly from feedback from both students and readers around the globe: at the time of writing, the project has 330 issues and 385 pull requests.</p>



<p>A central difference between the approach I take and the one of previous courses is that I start from <strong>Boolean circuits</strong> as the first model of computation. Boolean circuits are crucial to teach the topics above:</p>



<ul><li>Cryptography is much more natural with circuits rather than Turing machines as the model of computation. Statements such as “128 bits of security” make no sense in the asymptotic Turing machine formalism, but can be made precise with circuits.</li><li>The standard model for quantum computing is quantum circuits.</li><li>Derandomization is best described using the circuit model, and of course many results such as BPP in the Polynomial-Hierarchy are best shown using circuits and the class P/poly as an intermediate concept. </li><li>Circuits are a very natural fit for machine learning, and in particular Neural Networks are just a special type of circuit.</li></ul>



<p>Finally, while circuits are often considered an “advanced” topic, they have some advantages over automata as the initial model of computation:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Finite is always easier than infinite:</strong> Starting with circuits enables us to start the course talking about arguably the simplest object: finite functions. Writing down the truth table of a finite function, and showing that there is more than one circuit to compute the same function, also helps clarify the difference between <strong>specification</strong> of a function and its <strong>implementation</strong> by some algorithm, which is distinction that many students grapple with.</li><li><strong>Circuits are connected to actual hardware</strong>. An intro to TCS course is not a pure math course – we want to convey to students that are models are motivated by actual computing. Circuits make this connection much closer, and less artificial than automata or even Turing machines.</li><li><strong>Can show cool theorems early.</strong> If we start with automata, then the first theorems we show can often seem not well motivated to students. It takes some time to build the machinery to show the main theorem – equivalence of automata and regular expressions – and the proof of that theorem is rather technical. In contrast, with circuits we can show three important theorems rather quickly: <strong>(1)</strong> <em>every</em> finite function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%5Crightarrow+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}" class="latex" /> can be computed by some circuit of at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%282%5En%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\tilde{O}(2^n)" class="latex" /> size, <strong>(2)</strong> <em>every</em> circuit of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="s" class="latex" /> can be represented as a labeled graph and hence (using adjacency list)  by a string of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%28s%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\tilde{O}(s)" class="latex" />, and <strong>(3)</strong> using (2) and the fact that there are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{2^n}" class="latex" /> functions mapping <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\{0,1\}^n" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\{0,1\}" class="latex" />, there <em>exist</em> some function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%5Crightarrow+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}" class="latex" /> that <em>requires</em> a circuit of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7B%5COmega%7D%282%5En%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\tilde{\Omega}(2^n)" class="latex" /> gates.</li></ol>



<p>While the course is a theory course, and not about programming, one of my goals in the book and course was to connect it to programming. This is not just to motivate students and make them feel that the material is “practical” but also to better understand the theory itself. Notions such as NP-completeness reductions can be often confusing to students (which is why they get the direction wrong half the time). Implementing a reduction from 3SAT to independent set and seeing the end result make it much more concrete.</p>



<p></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/image-1.png"><img src="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/image-1.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-8409" /></a>3SAT to independent set reduction from the <a href="https://introtcs.org/public/lec_12_NP.html#the-independent-set-problem">chapter on NP reductions</a>.</figure></div>


<p>One way in which I wanted to use programming is to demonstrate to students how we can take a piece of Python code such as the code for adding two numbers given in their binary representation:</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: python; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">def add(A,B): 
      """Add two binary numbers, given as lists of bits"""
      Y = []
      carry = zero(A[0]) # initialize carry to 0
      for i in range(len(A)): # compute i-th digit of output
            y = xor(A[i],B[i],carry) # xor function
            carry = maj(A[i],B[i],carry) # majority function
            Y.append(y)
      Y.append(carry)
      return Y

</pre></div>


<p>And obtain the corresponding circuit:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/image-2.png"><img src="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/image-2.png?w=1007" alt="" class="wp-image-8413" /></a></figure>



<p>The code also uses the following one-linear helper functions</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: python; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">def maj(a,b,c): return (a &amp; b) | (b&amp;c) | (a&amp;c)
def zero(a): return a &amp; ~a
def xor2(a,b): return (a &amp; ~b) | (~a &amp; b)
def xor(*L): return xor2(*L) if len(L)==2 else xor2(xor(*L[:-1]),L[-1])
</pre></div>


<p>If you think about it, the task corresponds to extracting the <strong>computational graph</strong> of a piece of Python code. This is precisely the same task that <em>auto-differentiation</em> packages such as <a href="https://pytorch.org/">Pytorch</a> need to do. Hence it can be solved in a similar way. Thus, inspired by Karpathy’s <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd">micro-grad</a> package (see my <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2020/11/03/yet-another-backpropagation-tutorial/">back-propagation tutorial</a>) and using the awesome <a href="https://schemdraw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">SchemDraw</a> package, I wrote a short <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Hv6LVrEZDJ5s5NgR1bZPbCkz5NLIgX8d#scrollTo=Y-XFrGdO069l"><strong>colab notebook</strong></a> that does precisely that.</p>



<p>Specifically, the notebook defines a <code>Bit</code> class that (as its name suggests) stores a single bit. The class defines the logical AND, OR and NOT operations ( <code>&amp;</code>, <code>|</code> , <code>~</code> in Python). If a and b are two bits then <code>c = a &amp; b</code> not just contains the value which is the AND of the values of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, but also pointers to a and b and remembers how it was computed from them.  This allows  us to obtain from <code>c</code> a formula/circuit expressing it in terms of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: python; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">class Bit:
  counter  = 0
  def __init__(self,val=0, label="-"): 
    self.label = label
    self.data = val
    self.children = []
  
  def op(self,f, label, *others):
    inputs = [self.data] + [o.data for o in others]
    out = Bit(f(*inputs),label)
    out.children = [self] + list(others)
    return out

  def __and__(self,other): return self.op(lambda a,b: a &amp; b, "\\wedge", other)
  def __or__(self,other): return self.op(lambda a,b: a | b, "\\vee", other)
  def __invert__(self): return self.op(lambda a: ~a, "\\neg")
</pre></div>


<p>Now we can write a simple recursive function <code>formula</code> (see the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Hv6LVrEZDJ5s5NgR1bZPbCkz5NLIgX8d#scrollTo=g7ykkoEbH6NJ">notebook</a>) to give out the latex of the formula corresponding to how a particular bit was computed. So if we write </p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: python; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">from IPython.display import Markdown, display, Math
Y = xor(Bit(0,"X_0"), Bit(1,"X_1"))
Math(formula(Y))
</pre></div>


<p>Then we will get</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/image-3.png"><img src="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/image-3.png?w=283" alt="" class="wp-image-8421" /></a></figure>



<p>The code of a recursive function that transforms this into the circuit </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/image-4.png"><img src="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/image-4.png?w=659" alt="" class="wp-image-8423" /></a>is only slightly more complicated. The code to draw the addition circuit above is the following:</figure>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: python; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate">A = [Bit(0,f"A_{i}") for i in range(2)]
B = [Bit(0,f"B_{i}") for i in range(2)]
draw_circ(*add(A,B))
</pre></div>


<p>See the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Hv6LVrEZDJ5s5NgR1bZPbCkz5NLIgX8d#scrollTo=hHqMEfe9ZUY6">colab notebook</a> for more.</p></div>

<p>An often-expressed sentiment is that deep learning (and machine learning in general) is “simply statistics,” in the sense that it uses different words to describe the same concepts statisticians have been studying for decades. In the 1990s, Rob Tibshirani wrote the following tongue-in-cheek “glossary”::</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="442" alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RauK9YOaLdTiw42nyAQHRuuV9nLfa-zKY49NgpOX1z0pDk0QSe77LQLtZHtAt575adehcZjv7Jbkg8FvXqLklGvprfBRzYaNSk-Q7EtIuV0Kda-5fgCqXLC1xCZuPWzeJAxIbQMCAj6mKMAfeA" height="300" /></figure></div>


<p>Something about this table resonates with me.  In fact, as anyone using Pytorch knows, since Tibshiriani posted this table, many of the terms on the right have found broader use in the machine learning community. (And I do hope that statisticians’ grants and conferences have improved as well…)</p>



<p>But thinking of deep learning purely in terms of statistics misses crucial aspects of its success. A better critique of deep learning is that <strong>it uses statistical terms to describe radically different concepts</strong>. In meme form, it is the “Princess Bride” meme on the right that is a better critique of deep learning than <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sandserifcomics/">sandserif</a>’s meme on the left. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p></p>



<p><strong>This blog post: organization. </strong>In this post, I explain this point of view and why some of the most fundamental aspects of deep learning deviate radically from statistics and even from classical machine learning. In this somewhat long post, I’ll start by talking about the difference between <strong>explanation</strong> and <strong>prediction</strong> when fitting models to data. I’ll then discuss two “cartoons” of a learning process: <strong>fitting a statistical model</strong> using empirical risk minimization and <strong>teaching a math skill to a (human) student</strong>. I then discuss which one of those processes is a closer match to deep learning. Spoiler: while the math and code of deep learning is nearly identical to the first scenario (fitting a statistical model), I claim that a deeper level, some of deep learning’s most aspects are captured by the “teaching a skill to a student” scenario. I do not claim to have a full theory for deep learning. In fact,I strongly suspect such a theory doesn’t exist. Rather, I believe different aspects of deep learning are best understood from different lenses, and the statistical lens cannot provide the complete picture.</p>



<p><em>Caveat:</em><strong> </strong> While I contrast deep learning with statistics in this post, I refer to “classical statistics” as it was studied in the past and explained in textbooks. Many statisticians are studying deep learning and going beyond classical methods, analogously to how physicists in the 20th century needed to expand the framework of classical physics. Indeed, the blurring of the lines between computer scientists and statisticians is a modern (and very welcome!) phenomenon that benefits us all. </p>



<h2><strong>1) Predictions vs. explanations in model fitting.</strong></h2>



<p>Scientists have fitted models to observations for thousands of years. For example, as mentioned in my <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2022/05/03/philosophy-of-science-and-the-blockchain-a-book-review/">philosophy of science book review post</a>, the Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy came up with an ingenious model for the movement of the planets. Ptolemy’s model was geocentric (with planets rotating around the earth) but had a sequence of “knobs” (concretely, epicycles) that gave it excellent predictive accuracy. In contrast, Copernicus’ initial <em>heliocentric</em> model posited a circular orbit of planets around the sun. It was a simpler model than Ptolemy’s (with fewer “adjustable knobs”) and got the big picture right, but was <em>less accurate</em> in predicting observations. (Copernius later added his own epicycles so he could match Ptolemy’s performance.)</p>



<p>Ptolemy’s and Copernicus’ models were incomparable. If you needed a “black box” for <strong>predictions</strong>, then Ptolemy’s geocentric model was superior. If you wanted a simple model into which you can “peer inside” and that could be the starting point for a theory to <strong>explain</strong> the movements of the stars, then Copernicus’ model was better. Indeed, eventually, Kepler refined Copernicus’ models to elliptical orbits and came up with his three laws of planetary movements, which enabled Newton to explain them using the same laws of gravity that apply here on earth. For that, it was crucial that the heliocentric model wasn’t simply a “black box” that provides predictions, but rather was given by simple mathematical equations with few “moving parts.” Over the years, astronomy continued to be an inspiration for developing statistical techniques. Gauss and Legendre (independently) <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2240811">invented least-squares regression</a> around 1800 to predict the orbits of asteroids and other celestial bodies. Cauchy’s <a href="https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/documenta/vol-ismp/40_lemarechal-claude.pdf">1847 invention of gradient descent</a> was also motivated by astronomical predictions.</p>



<p>In physics, you can (at least sometimes) “have it all” – find the “right” theory that achieves the best predictive accuracy and the best explanation for the data. This is captured by sentiments such as Occam’s Razor, which can be thought of as positing that simplicity, predictive power, and explanatory insights, are all aligned with one another. However, in many other fields, there is a tension between the twin goals of <strong>explanation</strong> (or, more generally, <strong>insight</strong>) and <strong>prediction</strong>. If you simply want to predict observations, then a “black box” could very well be best. On the other hand, if you want to extract insights such as a causal model, general principles, or significant features, then a simpler model that you can understand and interpret might be better. The right choice of model depends on its usage. Consider, for example, a dataset containing genetic expressions and a phenotype (say some disease) for many individuals. If your goal is to predict<strong> </strong>the chances of an individual getting sick, you want to use the best model for that task, regardless of how complex it is or how many genes it depends on. In contrast, if your goal is to identify a few genes for further investigation in a wet lab, a complicated black box would be of limited use, even if it’s highly accurate.</p>



<p>This point was forcefully made in <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-16/issue-3/Statistical-Modeling--The-Two-Cultures-with-comments-and-a/10.1214/ss/1009213726.full">Leo Breiman’s famous 2001 essay on the two cultures of statistical modeling</a>. The “data modeling culture” focuses on simple generative models that <strong>explain</strong> the data. In contrast, the “algorithmic modeling culture” is agnostic on how the data is generated and focuses on finding models that <strong>predict </strong>the data, no matter how complex. Breiman argued that statistics was too dominated by the first culture, and this focus has <em>“</em><em>led to irrelevant theory and questionable scientific conclusions”</em> and <em>“prevented statisticians from working on exciting new problems.”</em></p>



<p>Breiman’s paper was controversial, to say the least. Brad Efron responded to it by saying that, while he agreed with some points, <em>“at first glance, Leo Breiman’s stimulating paper looks like an argument against parsimony and scientific insight, and in favor of black boxes with lots of knobs to twiddle. At second glance, it still looks that way”</em> (see also <a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~kass/papers/KassOnBreiman.pdf">Kass</a>). In a <a href="https://www.fox.temple.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Efron-2020-JASA-wdiscussion.pdf">more recent piece</a>, Efron graciously concedes that <em>“Breiman turned out to be more prescient than me: pure prediction algorithms have seized the statistical limelight in the twenty-first century, developing much along the lines Leo suggested.”</em></p>



<h2><strong>2) Classical and modern predictive models.</strong></h2>



<p>Machine learning, deep or not, stands firmly in Breiman’s second culture, with a focus on <strong>prediction</strong>. This culture has a long history.  For example, the following snippets from <a href="https://archive.org/details/patternclassific0000duda">Duda and Hart’s 1973 textbook</a> and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1962.tb02426.x">Highleyman’s 1962 paper</a> would be very recognizable to deep learning practitioners today:</p>

<h2><strong>3) Why deep learning is different.</strong></h2>



<p>In 1992, <a href="https://www.dam.brown.edu/people/documents/bias-variance.pdf">Geman, Bienenstock, and Doursat</a> wrote a pessimistic article about neural networks, arguing that <em>“current-generation feed-forward neural networks are largely inadequate for difficult problems in machine perception and machine learning”</em>. Specifically, they believed that general-purpose neural networks would not be successful in tackling difficult tasks, and the only way for them to succeed would be via hand-designed features. In their words: <em>“important properties must be built-in or “hard-wired” … not learned in any statistically meaningful way.”</em> In hindsight (which is always 20/20), Geman et al. were completely wrong (if anything, modern architectures such as transformers are even <em>more general</em> than the convolutional networks that existed at the time), but it is interesting to understand <em>why</em> they were wrong. </p>



<p>I believe that the reason is that deep learning is genuinely different from other learning methods. A priori, it seems that deep learning is just one more predictive model, like nearest neighbors or random forests. It may have more “knobs,” but that seems to be a quantitative rather than qualitative difference. However, <a href="https://cse-robotics.engr.tamu.edu/dshell/cs689/papers/anderson72more_is_different.pdf">in the words of P.W. Andreson</a>, <strong>“more is different.”</strong>    In Physics, we often need a completely different theory once scale changes by several orders of magnitude, and the same holds in deep learning. The processes that underlie deep learning vs. classical models (parametric or not) are radically different, even if the equations (and Python code) look identical at a high level. </p>



<p>To clarify this point, let’s consider two very different learning processes:<strong> fitting a statistical model</strong> and <strong>teaching math to a student</strong>.</p>



<h3><strong>Scenario A: Fitting a statistical model</strong></h3>



<p>Classically, fitting a statistical model to data corresponds to the following:</p>



<ol><li>We observe some data <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%2Cy&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X,y" class="latex" />. (Think of  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> as an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5Ctimes+p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n\times p" class="latex" /> matrix and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" /> as an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> dimensional vector; think of the data as coming from a <strong>structure and noise</strong> model: each coordinate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="y_i" class="latex" /> is obtained as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_0%28x_i%29%2Be_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f_0(x_i)+e_i" class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="e_i" class="latex" /> is the corresponding noise , using additive noise for simplicity, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f_0" class="latex" /> as the “ground truth.”)</li><li>We fit a model <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\hat{f}" class="latex" /> to the data by running some <strong>optimization algorithm</strong> to minimize an <strong>empirical risk</strong> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\hat{f}" class="latex" />. That is, we use optimization to (try to) find <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\hat{f}" class="latex" /> that minimizes a quantity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%28%5Chat%7Bf%7D%29+%2B+R%28%5Chat%7Bf%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="L(\hat{f}) + R(\hat{f})" class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%28%5Ccdot%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="L(\cdot)" class="latex" /> is a loss term (capturing how close <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7Bf%7D%28X%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\hat{f}(X)" class="latex" /> is to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" />) and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28%5Chat%7Bf%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="R(\hat{f})" class="latex" /> is an optional regularization term (attempting to bias <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\hat{f}" class="latex" /> toward simpler models under some measure). </li><li>Our hope is that our model will have good <strong>population loss</strong>, in the sense that the <strong>generalization error/loss</strong>  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D+%5BL%28%5Chat%7Bf%7D%28x%29%2Cy%29%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb{E} [L(\hat{f}(x),y)]" class="latex" /> is small (where this expectation is taken over the total population from which our data was drawn).</li></ol>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="-290" alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/j84eNgmOsBGbSDI3nbHRLMmKYP-fAqSSfkjX6eZOlndHm00xibwbMEfLcW4Yw58JpZK9bgzc1gFvTzsZsUPVC4r1pnpB_koZv1kBpn_L4dHQBWuVk5cDwwoAZj-nVlTRu1twjUh25ihRTDcglQ" height="-135" /><strong>Figure:</strong> <a href="https://www.fox.temple.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Efron-2020-JASA-wdiscussion.pdf">Effron’s</a> cartoon of recovering Newton’s first law from noisy observations.</figure></div>


<p>This very general paradigm captures many settings, including least-squares linear regression, nearest neighbors,  neural network training, and more. In the classical statistical setup, we expect to observe the following: </p>



<p><strong>Bias/variance tradeoff:</strong> Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{F}" class="latex" /> be the set of models that we optimize over. (If we are in the non-convex setting and/or have a regularizer term, we can let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{F}" class="latex" /> be the set of such models that can be achieved by the algorithm with non-negligible probability, taking the effects of algorithm choice and regularizer into account.)  The <strong>bias</strong> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{F}" class="latex" /> is the best approximation to the ground truth that can be achieved by an element <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7Bf%7D+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\hat{f} \in \mathcal{F}" class="latex" />. The larger the class <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{F}" class="latex" />, the smaller the bias, and it can be zero if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_0+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f_0 \in \mathcal{F}" class="latex" />. However, the larger the class <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{F}" class="latex" />, the more samples we would need to narrow down its members and hence the more <strong>variance</strong> in the model that the algorithm outputs. The overall <strong>generalization error</strong> is the sum of the bias term and the contribution from the variance. Hence statistical learning typically displays a <strong>bias/variance tradeoff,</strong> with a “goldilocks choice” of the right model complexity that minimizes the overall error.  Indeed, Geman et al. justified their pessimism on neural networks by saying that <em>“the fundamental limitations resulting from the bias-variance dilemma apply to all nonparametric inference models, including neural networks.” </em></p>



<p><strong>More is not always better.</strong> In statistical learning, getting more features or data does not necessarily improve performance. For example, learning from data that contains many irrelevant features is more challenging. Similarly, learning from a mixture model, in which data comes from one of two distributions (e.g., <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Df_0%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="y=f_0(x)" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Df_1%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="y=f_1(x)" class="latex" />), is harder than learning each distribution independently. </p>



<p><strong>Diminishing returns.</strong> In many settings, the number of data points needed to reduce the prediction noise to a level of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\epsilon" class="latex" /> scales as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%2F%5Cepsilon%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k/\epsilon^2" class="latex" /> for some parameter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" />. In such cases, it takes about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> samples to “get off the ground” but once we do so we face a regime of diminishing returns, whereby if it took <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> points to achieve (say) 90% accuracy, it will take roughly an additional <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="3n" class="latex" /> points to increase accuracy to 95%. In general, as we increase our resources (whether data, model complexity, or computation) we expect to capture finer and finer distinctions rather than unlocking qualitatively new capabilities.</p>



<p><strong>Strong dependence on loss, data.</strong> When fitting a model to high-dimensional data, small details can make a big difference. Statisticians know that choices such as an L1 or L2 regularizer matter, not to mention using completely different datasets (e.g., Wikipedia vs. Reddit). High-dimensional optimizers of different quantities will be very different from one another.</p>



<p><strong>No natural “difficulty” of data points (at least in some settings)</strong>. Traditionally, we think of data points as sampled independently from some distribution. Though points closer to the decision boundary could be harder to classify, given the concentration-of-measure phenomena in high dimensions, we expect that most points would be of similar distance. Thus at least in classical data distributions, we don’t expect points to vary greatly in their difficulty level. However, mixture models can display such variance in difficulty level, and hence, unlike the other issues above, such variance would not be terribly surprising in the statistical setting.</p>



<h3><strong>Scenario B: Learning math</strong></h3>



<p>In contrast to the above, consider the setting of teaching a student some particular topic in mathematics (e.g., computing derivatives), by giving them general instructions, as well as exercises to work through. This is not a formally defined setting, but let’s consider some of its qualitative features:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="567" alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FLZEzRfYsdYYku-FxQlt8r6oc9PAAXqaoGo5-R2ABxKoGB1hxUvJWiSYxt1weyqTJGujoGh1YhIAoE_2RuM-nzzSicDlpjDSFjAXeedX2schUZEb3VB7dWQirp4n1bt90Qz3_K5SlYHeg9zJ6w" height="360" /><strong>Figure: </strong>An exercise to learn a particular math skill from the <a href="https://www.ixl.com/math/calculus/find-derivatives-using-the-product-rule">IXL website</a>.</figure></div>


<p></p>



<p><strong>Learning a skill, rather than approximating a distribution.</strong> In this setting, the student learns a <em>skill</em> rather than an estimator/predictor for some quantity. While defining “skill” is not a trivial task (and not one we’ll undertake in this blog post), it is a qualitatively different object. In particular, even if the function mapping exercises to solutions cannot be used as a “black box” to solve some related task X, we believe that the <strong>internal representations</strong> that the student develops while working through these problems can still be useful for X.</p>



<p><strong>More is better.</strong> Generally, students that do more problems and problems of different types achieve better performance. A “mixture model” – doing some calculus problems and some algebra problems – does not hurt the student in their calculus performance and in fact, could only help.</p>



<p><strong>“Grokking” or unlocking capabilities, moving to automatic representations.</strong> While at some point there are diminishing returns also when solving problems, students do seem to undergo several phases. There is a stage in which doing some problems helps a concept “click” and unlocks new capabilities. Also, as students repeat problems of a specific type, they seem to move their facilities and representations of these problems to a lower level, enabling certain automaticity with them that they didn’t have before.</p>



<p><strong>Performance is partially independent of the loss and data.</strong> There is more than one way to teach mathematical concepts. Students who study with different books, educational approaches, or grading systems can eventually learn the same material and (as far as we can tell) similar internal representations of it.</p>



<p><strong>Some problems are harder than others.</strong> In math exercises, we often see a strong correlation between how different students solve the same problem. There does seem to be an inherent difficulty level for a problem and a natural progression of difficulty that is optimal for learning. Indeed this is precisely what is being done by platforms such as <a href="https://www.ixl.com/">IXL</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>4) Is deep learning more like statistical estimation or a student learning a skill?</strong></h2>



<p>So, which of the above two metaphors more appropriately captures modern deep learning, and specifically the reasons why it is so successful? Statistical model fitting seems to correspond well to the math and the code. Indeed the canonical Pytorch training loop trains deep networks through empirical risk minimization as described above:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="402" alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/yf9rz1IV1Ac1LvzQPzh8rY3GLZpecxUtOjm-ITQRuWHb3vrPjDAd5BLUTitGPWlYAFtVR8Ou7a2JnsMIld33hPoe2QKeNXsQLySJIGbNgMCdvx0Vcr7No6cBHXxDClY1xvYNN6iBUJbX6bhEzA" height="182" /></figure></div>


<p>However, on a deeper level, the relation between the two settings is not as clear. For concreteness, let us fix a particular learning task. Consider a classification algorithm that is trained using the method of “self-supervised learning + a linear probe” (what we called Self-Supervised + Simple or SSS in <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2020/10/18/understanding-generalization-requires-rethinking-deep-learning/">our paper with Bansal and Kaplun</a>). Concretely, the algorithm is trained as follows:</p>



<ol><li>Suppose that the data is a sequence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B+%28x_i%2Cy_i%29+%5C%7D_%7Bi%3D1..n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\{ (x_i,y_i) \}_{i=1..n}" class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ep+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x_i \in \mathbb{R}^p " class="latex" /> is some datapoint (say an image for concreteness) and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="y_i" class="latex" /> is a label.</li><li>We first find a deep neural network implementing <em>representation function</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7Br%7D%3A%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ep+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\hat{r}:\mathbb{R}^p \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d" class="latex" />. This function is trained only using the datapoints <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B+x_1%2C%5Cldots%2C+x_n+%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\{ x_1,\ldots, x_n \}" class="latex" /> and not using the labels by minimizing some type of a self-supervised loss function. Example of such loss functions are <em>reconstruction</em> or in-painting (recovering some part of the input <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> from another) or <em>contrastive learning</em> (finding <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\hat{r}" class="latex" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cparallel+%5Chat%7Br%7D%28x%29-%5Chat%7Br%7D%28x%27%29+%5Cparallel&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\parallel \hat{r}(x)-\hat{r}(x') \parallel" class="latex" /> is significantly smaller when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2Cx%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x,x'" class="latex" /> are augmentations of the same datapoint than when they are two random points).  </li><li>We then use the full labeled data <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B+%28x_i%2Cy_i+%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\{ (x_i,y_i )" class="latex" /> to fit a linear classifier <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cell%7D%3A%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed+%5Cto+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ec&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\hat{\ell}:\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^c" class="latex" /> (where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="c" class="latex" /> is the number of classes) that minimizes the cross-entropy loss. Our final classifier is the map <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cmapsto+%5Cmathrm%7Barg%7D%5Cmax+%5Chat%7B%5Cell%7D%28%5Chat%7Br%7D%28x%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x \mapsto \mathrm{arg}\max \hat{\ell}(\hat{r}(x))" class="latex" />.</li></ol>



<p>Step 3 merely fits a linear classifier and so the “magic” happens in step 2 (self-supervised learning of a deep network). Some of the properties we see in self-supervised learning include:</p>



<p><strong>Learning a skill rather than approximating a function. </strong>Self-supervised learning is not about approximating a function but rather learning representations that could be used in a variety of downstream tasks. For example, this is the dominant paradigm in natural language processing. Whether the downstream task is obtained through linear probe, fine tuning, or prompting is of secondary importance.</p>



<p><strong>More is better.</strong> In self-supervised learning, representation quality improves with data quantity. We don’t suffer from mixing in several sources: in fact, the more diverse the data is, the better. </p>

<p><strong>Performance is largely independent of loss or data</strong>. There is more than one self-supervised loss. Several contrastive and reconstruction losses have been used for images. For language models, we sometimes use one-sided reconstruction (predict next token) and sometimes masked models whose goal is to predict a masked input from both the left and right token. We can also use slightly different datasets. These can make differences in efficiency, but as long as we make “reasonable” choices, typically raw resources are more significant predictors of performance than the particular loss or dataset used.</p>



<p><strong>Some instances are harder than others.</strong> This point is not specific to self-supervised learners. It does seem that data points have some inherent “difficulty level”. Indeed, we have several pieces of empirical evidence for the notion that different learning algorithms have a different “skill level” and different points have a different “difficulty level” (with the probability of classifier <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> classifying point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> correctly being monotonically increasing with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" />’s skill and monotonically decreasing with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" />’s difficulty). The “skill vs. difficulty” paradigm is the cleanest explanation for the “accuracy on the line” phenomenon uncovered by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10811">Recht et al</a> and  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04649">Miller et al</a>. Our paper with Kaplun, Ghosh, Garg, and Nakkiran also shows how different inputs in datasets have an inherent “difficulty profile” that seems to be generally robust with respect to different model families.</p>

<p><strong>Training as teaching.</strong> Training of modern large models seems much more like teaching a student than fitting a model to data, complete with “taking breaks” or trying different approaches when the student doesn’t get it or seems tired (training diverges). The <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/metaseq/tree/main/projects/OPT/chronicles">training logbook of Meta’s large model</a> is instructive- aside from issues with hardware, we can see interventions such as switching different optimization algorithms in the middle of training and even considering “hot swapping” the activation functions (GELU to RELU). The latter doesn’t make much sense if you think of model training as fitting data as opposed to learning representations. </p>

<h2><strong>4.1) But what about supervised learning?</strong></h2>



<p>Up to this point, we only discussed self-supervised learning, but the canonical example of deep learning- the one you teach first in a course- is still supervised learning. After all, deep learning’s “ImageNet moment” came with, well, ImageNet. Does anything we said above still apply to this setting?</p>



<p>First, the emergence of supervised large-scale deep learning is to some extent a historical accident, aided by the availability of large high quality labeled datasets (i.e. ImageNet). One could imagine an alternative history in which deep learning first started showing breakthrough advances in Natural Language Processing via unsupervised learning, and only later transported into vision and supervised learning.</p>



<p>Second,  we have some evidence that even though they use radically different loss functions, supervised and self-supervised learning behave similarly “under the hood.” Both often achieve the same performance, and in work with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07682">Bansal and Nakkiran</a>, we showed that they also learn similar internal representations. Concretely, for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%5Cin+%5C%7B1..d-1%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k \in \{1..d-1\}" class="latex" />, one can “stitch together” the first <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> layers of a depth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d" class="latex" /> model that was trained via self-supervision with the last <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d-k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d-k" class="latex" /> layers of a supervised model with little loss in performance. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

If the models are completely incompatible then we expect accuracy to drop sharply as we stitch more models. Right: Actual results for stitching different self-supervised models. We also stitch a random network as a “sanity check”.</figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>The advantage of self-supervised + simple models is that they can separate out the aspects of feature learning or “deep learning magic” (done by the deep representation function) from the statistical model fitting (done by the linear or other “simple” classifier on top of this representation).</p>



<p>Finally, while this is more speculative, the fact that often “meta learning” seems to amount to learning representations (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09157">Raghu et al.</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03271">Mandi et. al.</a>)  can be considered as another piece of evidence that this is much of what’s going on, regardless of the objective that the model ostensibly optimizes. </p>



<h2><strong>4.2) What about over parameterization?</strong></h2>



<p>The reader may have noticed that I skipped over what is considered the canonical example of the disparity between the model of statistical learning and deep learning in practice: the absence of a “bias-variance tradeoff” (see Belkin et al.’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11118">double descent</a>) and the ability of over-parameterized models to generalize well.</p>



<p>There are two reasons I do not focus on this aspect. First, if supervised learning really does correspond to self-supervised + simple learning “under the hood” then that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08508">may explain its generalization ability</a>.  Second, I think that over parameterization is <em>not</em> crucial to deep learning’s success. Deep networks are special not because they are big compared to the number of samples but because they are big in absolute terms. Indeed, typically in unsupervised / self-supervised learning models are <em>not</em> over parameterized. Even for the very large language models, their datasets are larger still. This does not make their performance any less mysterious.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="673" alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BgGdDZHOPsPxw2-dYE49AS7Lc_Opwqmg19d0PAUVNX9vwSOadwVrQAingo1pXUOJ_o13v25QV_SFQU7qdtSBwGk05VsWwsIwyc2j8wcGBkZ9m3wWCyiOOwTynhF3zWFZFe1PmDJKCZgO1IDl4A" height="292" /><strong>Figure: </strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08127">Nakkiran-Neyshabur-Sadghi’s</a> “deep bootstrap” paper demonstrates that modern architectures behave similarly in the “over parameterized” or “under sampled” regime (where models train for multiple epochs on limited data until over fitting: “real world” in the above figure) and “under parameterized” or “online” regime (where models train for a single epoch, seeing each sample only once: “ideal world” in the above figure). </figure></div>


<p></p>



<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>



<p>Statistical learning certainly plays a role in deep learning. However, despite using similar terms and code, thinking of deep learning as simply fitting a model with more knobs than classical models misses a lot of what is essential to its success. The human student metaphor is hardly perfect either. Like biological evolution, even though deep learning consists of many repeated applications of the same rule – gradient descent on empirical loss- it gives rise to highly complex outcomes. It seems that at different times different components of networks learn different things, including, representation learning, prediction fitting, implicit regularization, and pure noise. We are still searching for the right lens by which to ask questions about deep learning, let alone answer them.</p>

<p>Next Monday, June 27, I am organizing a workshop on issues around fairness, bias and discrimination in AI and Machine Learning.</p>



<p>Here is a <a href="https://lucatrevisan.github.io/fai.html">link to the program</a>. Remote participation is possible (link in the website), and in-person participation is free but we ask people to register so we can print badges and order the appropriate number of coffee breaks.</p>



<p>This workshop is being organized in partnership with <a href="https://www.edge-glbt.it/">EDGE</a>, an Italian NGO that works on LGBT rights, and it is the first event of their initiative “A+I: Algoritmi + Inclusivi”, which will feature an awareness campaign and a series of video interviews that will start after the summer.</p>



<p>In next week’s workshop, Oreste Pollicino from Bocconi will talk about the perspective of the legal community around algorithmic discrimination, Symeon Papadopoulos from ITI Patras will give a survey on issues of fairness in image processing and image understanding, Sanghamitra Dutta from J.P. Morgan AI will talk about how to use the theory of causality to reason about fairness, Debora Nozza and Dirk Hovy from Bocconi will talk about issues of fairness in language models and natural language processing, and Omer Reingold from Stanford and Cynthia Dwork from Harvard will talk about modeling and achieving fairness in prediction models.</p>



<p>The last morning session will be a panel discussion moderated by Damiano Terziotti from EDGE about perspectives from the social sciences and from outside academia. It will feature, among others, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brando_Benifei">Brando Benifei</a>, a member of the EU parliament who has played a leading role in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence_Act">2021 draft EU regulations on AI</a>. The other panel members are Alessandro Bonaita, who is a data science lead in Generali (Italy’s largest insurance company), Luisella Giani, who is leading a technology consulting branch of Oracle for Europe, Middle East and Africa, Cinzia Maiolini, who is in the national secretariat of CGIL, an Italian Union, and Massimo Airoldi from the University of Milan.</p>



<p>If you are in or near Milan next week, come to what is shaping up to be a memorable event!</p></div>

Bill Wyman was the bass guitarist of the Rolling Stones until 1993. He married Mandy Smith in 1989. A few years later, in 1993, his son, Stephen Wyman, married Mandy Smith’s mother, Patsy Smith. Had Bill and Mandy not divorced by then, Wyman would have been his own step<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%2C%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\,^2}" class="latex" />father. Which Wyman do we mean? Both of them.</p>
<p>
Today we investigate the level of degeneracy in “family tree” type graphs.</p>
<p>
We say “family tree” but it cannot be a tree. If your great<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%2C%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\,^k}" class="latex" />-grandparents were all distinct for every value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />, then at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+%3D+30%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k = 30}" class="latex" /> you would have over one billion distinct ancestors at that level—and two billion in your whole tree—virtually all born after the year 1100 CE. The world population is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population_milestones">estimated</a> not to have passed one billion until after 1800. </p>
<p>
At least we can say it cannot have cycles. You cannot be your own biological grandfather, for reasons more fundamental than not being able to go back in time to kill your grandfather. Thus the graph is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">DAG</a>—a <em>directed acyclic graph</em>. Is “DAG” a jargon term? It should be regarded as common—it is, after all, the stuff of us.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Implex and Amplex </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The fact that you are descended by multiple paths from common ancestors is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedigree_collapse">pedigree collapse</a> by Wikipedia, rather dramatically. </p>
<p>
The degree of pedigree collapse, meaning the difference between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2^k}" class="latex" /> and your actual number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" /> of level-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> ancestors—is called the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/implex">implex</a>. This is not a legal word in official US <a href="https://scrabble.hasbro.com/en-us/tools#dictionary">Scrabble</a> (TM), but does appear on the larger US-UK <a href="https://www.wordgamedictionary.com/sowpods/download/sowpods.txt">SOWPODS</a> list. </p>
<p>
The ratio <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7BA%7D%7B2%5Ek%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\frac{A}{2^k}}" class="latex" /> strikes me as more natural than the difference. To keep it representing “collapse,” one would have to do <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1+-+%5Cfrac%7BA%7D%7B2%5Ek%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1 - \frac{A}{2^k}}" class="latex" />, but the original ratio is more convenient in what follows. I propose calling it the <b>amplex</b>, saying how ample one’s DAG of ancestors is. This term is not in SOWPODS but does appear (along with implex) in a downloadable <a href="https://github.com/dwyl/english-words">dictionary</a> of 466,551 meaningful words and names and abbreviations compiled by the organization <a href="https://dwyl.com/">dwyl</a> for “Do What You Love.” The word amplex originally <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/amplex">means</a> to engage in a process by which some amphibians make ample trees—or rather DAGs—of descendants.</p>
<p>
The ratio may be expected to stabilize once <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> becomes moderately large. We can say similar about the differences <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+-+%5Clog_2+A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k - \log_2 A}" class="latex" /> as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> grows. Finally, the ratio <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B%5Clog_2+A%7D%7Bk%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\frac{\log_2 A}{k}}" class="latex" /> is a technically different but similarly motivated notion of <em>amplex</em>. These logarithmic forms are most akin to information complexity measures.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> An Example </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
For an example of implex and amplex, let Alice have a completely unique tree of ancestors, so zero collapse and amplex ration <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1}" class="latex" />. Then Alice’s full brother, named Bob of course, has the same. Suppose Alice and Bob incestuously marry and have a child C. Then for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+%3D+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k = 2}" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{10}" class="latex" />, C has implex <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7Bk-1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2^{k-1}}" class="latex" /> in the difference form, or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{0.5}" class="latex" /> in the ratio form. The amplex ratio <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7BA%7D%7B2%5Ek%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\frac{A}{2^k}}" class="latex" /> is also <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{0.5}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>
Now suppose instead that Alice and Bob come from different families and each have amplex <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{0.4}" class="latex" />, i.e., <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7BA%7D%7B2%5Ek%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7BB%7D%7B2%5Ek%7D+%3D+0.4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\frac{A}{2^k} = \frac{B}{2^k} = 0.4}" class="latex" /> (where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{B}" class="latex" /> refers to Bob’s set of level-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> ancestors) at level <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+%3D+9%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k = 9}" class="latex" />. Then their child D at level <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+%3D+10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k = 10}" class="latex" /> has amplex <em>at most</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{0.4}" class="latex" />. The maximum is achieved when Alice and Bob are unrelated to each other—i.e., the sets <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S_A}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S_B}" class="latex" /> of their respective ancestors (saying out to level <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B9%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{9}" class="latex" />) are distinct. If they coincide, then D will have amplex only <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{0.2}" class="latex" />. </p>
<p>
It may seem intuitively wrong that the incestuous child C could have higher amplex—lower implex—than the child of unrelated parents, each with a reasonable ratio. This hints that some further modifications of these measures may be more effective, such as weighting differences of closer ancestors more. Insofar as different paths to the same level-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> ancestor define an equivalence relation on binary strings of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />, there are notions of prefixes and prefix-freedom that are relevant. </p>
<p>
I won’t try to sort such notions out now. I am only trying to be suggestive and invite reader suggestions. In the real world, <em>genomics</em> brings much more extensive notions of genetic diversity. What might help the world of computational complexity theory is more in mind here.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Analogy With Boolean Functions </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
There are various ways to set up a parenthood notion for Boolean functions. Given two Boolean functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%28x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\alpha(x_1,\dots,x_n)}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%28x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\beta(x_1,\dots,x_n)}" class="latex" />, any of the following can be regarded as an offspring:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%28x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%29+%5Cwedge+%5Cbeta%28x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\alpha(x_1,\dots,x_n) \wedge \beta(x_1,\dots,x_n)}" class="latex" />; <p></p>
</li><li>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%28x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%29+%5Cvee+%5Cbeta%28x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\alpha(x_1,\dots,x_n) \vee \beta(x_1,\dots,x_n)}" class="latex" />; <p></p>
</li><li>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%28x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%29+%5Coplus+%5Cbeta%28x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\alpha(x_1,\dots,x_n) \oplus \beta(x_1,\dots,x_n)}" class="latex" /> (etc.); <p></p>
</li><li>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28x_%7Bn%2B1%7D+%5Cwedge+%5Calpha%28x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%29%29+%5Cvee+%28%5Cbar%7Bx%7D_%7Bn%2B1%7D+%5Cwedge+%5Cbeta%28x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%29%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{(x_{n+1} \wedge \alpha(x_1,\dots,x_n)) \vee (\bar{x}_{n+1} \wedge \beta(x_1,\dots,x_n))}" class="latex" />.
</li></ul>
<p>
The idea that we are trying to tap into is the following: In complexity theory, we want to prove that a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" /> of functions are <em>hard</em>, meaning they do not have Boolean circuits of a given <em>small</em> size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />. The sets of hard functions overall are large, but we mean sets <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" /> of functions that are known in some other way, such as belonging to families that define problems in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" />. For the most part, it suffices to prove that <em>some</em> member of such an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" /> is hard. </p>
<p>
The usual mindset is to prove that circuits of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> have insufficient “virility” to compute members of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH.%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H.}" class="latex" /> The idea I wish to suggest instead is to try to prove that they are too incestuous—that too many of them compute copies of the same function. Then show that they cannot encompass all of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH.%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H.}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>
To make this work in the above framework, we may need to invert the notion of Boolean “offspring” suggested above, so that the ultimate function computed is styled as an ancestor. In any event, the idea is to structure the counting so that size-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> circuits cannot have all the members of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" /> in their collective “gene pool”—so that some member of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" /> must go uncomputed.</p>
<p>

Can you suggest further notions in genealogy—without going into genetics—and can they help resolve impasses in complexity?</p>

<div class="content">
<p>I suspect that Lance and/or I have had blogs giving advice to grad students. I won't point to any particular posts since that's a hard thing to search for. However, they were all written WAY AFTER Lance and I actually were grad students. Recently a former grad student at UMCP, Prahalad Rajkumar, emailed me that he wanted to do a post about advice for grad students. Since he has graduated more recently (Master degree in CS, topic was Monte Carlo Techniques, in 2009, then a job as a programmer-analyst) his advice may be better, or at least different, than ours was.</p><p>Here is his guest post with an occasional comment by me embedded in it. </p><p>----------------------------</p><p> <b>I Made this Fatal Mistake when I Joined a Graduate Program at Maryland</b></p><p>Getting accepted to a graduate program in a good school is an honor.</p><p>It is also an opportunity to do quality work and hone your skills. I made one fatal mistake at the start of my master’s degree at the University of Maryland which took me down a vicious rabbit hole. I believed that I was not cut out for this program.</p><p><b>The Only Person Who Gave an Incorrect Answer</b></p><p>Before the start of my graduate studies, there was an informal gathering held for newer students and some faculty members. A faculty member asked a basic algorithm question.</p><p>Everyone in the room gave one answer. I gave another answer.</p><p>This is real life and not Good Will Hunting, and of course, I was wrong. I had misunderstood the question. It would have been a simple matter to shrug and move forward. But the paternal voice in my head saw a good opportunity to continue to convince me that I was an imposter who did not belong here.</p><p><b>Who is Smarter than Whom?</b></p><p>Some of my fellow incoming graduate students, who TAed with me for Bill Gasarch’s class, played an innocent looking game.</p><p>“That guy is so smart”.</p><p>“I wish I were as smart as her”.</p><p>They couldn’t know that this would affect me. I too did not know that this could affect me. But it did. I asked myself “Am I smarter than person X?”. Each time, the paternal voice in my head was quick to answer “No”. And each time I took this “No” seriously.</p><p>NOTE FROM BILL: Professors also play <i>who is smarter than who</i> game and we shouldn't.</p><p><b>I Didn’t Choose My Classes Wisely</b></p><p>I made a few mistakes in choosing my classes. I chose Concrete Complexity with Bill, which I later realized I had no aptitude for. I chose an undergraduate class taught by a professor whose style did not resonate with me. Mercifully, I chose a third class that I liked and excelled in. A class which did not destroy my confidence.</p><p>In retrospect, though I chose a couple of classes that were not my cup of tea, I compounded my problems with the stories I told myself. I had several good options available to me. I could redouble my efforts in the said classes and give it my best shot. I could accept my inevitable “B” grades in these classes, and be mindful to choose better classes in the upcoming semesters.</p><p>I, however, did the one thing I should not have done: I further convinced myself that I was not cut out to be a graduate student.</p><div>NOTE FROM BILL: Some students wisely ask around to find out <i>who is a good teacher</i>? Prahalad points out that this is just the first question. A class may be appropriate for you or not based on many factors, not just if the instructor is a <i>good teacher.</i> </div><div><div><br /></div><div><b>I Fell Victim to Impostor Syndrome</b></div><div><br /></div><div>I kept compounding my woes in my second and third semesters. Things got bad -- I took up a position as a research assistant in my third semester. My confidence was low -- and I struggled to do basic tasks that fall under my areas of competence.</div><div><br /></div><div>In my fourth semester, I convinced myself that I could not code. In a class project where I had to do some coding as a part of a group project, I struggled to write a single line of code.</div><div><br /></div><div>When I confessed this to one of my group members, he got me out of my head. He got me to code my part more than capably. I’ve written about this experience <a href="https://os.me/short-stories/the-impostor-syndrome/">here</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><b> It Does Not Matter in the Slightest</b></div><div><br /></div><div>I wish I could tell the 2007 version of myself the following: It doesn’t matter who is smarter than whom. In any way whatsoever. We are on our individual journeys. In graduate school. In life.</div><div><br /></div><div>Comparing myself with another person is as productive as playing several hours of angry birds.</div><div><b><br /></b></div><div><b> The Admission Committee Believed in Me.</b></div><div><br /></div><div>There was one good reason I should have rejected the thought that I did not belong in the program. The admission committee believed that I belonged here. Consisting of several brilliant minds. If they thought I should be here, why should I second guess them?</div><div><br /></div><div>NOTE FROM BILL: While the Admissions committee DID believe in Prahalad and was CORRECT in this, I would not call the committee <i>brilliant</i>. As is well known, the IQ of a committee is the IQ of its dumbest member divided by the number of people on the committee. </div><div><br /></div><div><b>Bill Gasarch’s Secret Sauce</b></div><div><br /></div><div>Since I took a class with Bill and TAed for him, I had occasion to spend a lot of time with Bill.</div><div>In one conversation, Bill told me something profound. He told me the secret sauce behind his accomplishments. No, it was not talent. It was his willingness to work as hard as it takes.</div><div>And working hard is a superpower which is available to anyone who is inclined to invoke it. I wish I had.</div><div><br /></div><div>BILL COMMENT: The notion that hard work is important is of course old. I wonder how old. One of the best expressions of this that I read was in a book <i>Myths of Innovation</i> which said (a) Great ideas are over rated, (b) hard work and follow through are underrated. There are more sources on this notion in the next part of Prahalad's post. (Side Note- I got the book at the <i>Borders Books Going</i> <i>Out of Business Sale</i>. Maybe they should have read it.) </div><div><br /></div></div><div><div><br /></div><div><b>Talent is Overrated.</b></div><div><br /></div><div>I read a few books in the last couple of years that discussed the subject of mastery: Mastery by Robert Greene, Peak by Anders Ericsson, Talent is Overrated by Geoff Colvin, The Talent Code by Daniel Coyle, Grit by Angela Duckworth, Mindset by Carol Dweck</div><div><br /></div><div>There was one point that all of these books made: talent is not the factor which determines a person’s success. Their work ethic, their willingness to do what it takes, and several hours of deliberate practice is the secret of success. Of course, talent plays a part -- you can’t be 5’1 and hope to be better than Michael Jordan. But in the graduate school setting, where a majority are competent, it really is a matter of putting in the effort.</div><div><br /></div><div><b> Follow the Process</b></div><div><br /></div><div>Bill Walsh signed up as the coach of the languishing 49ers football team. The title of his bestselling book describes his coaching philosophy: The Score Takes Care of Itself. He established processes. Focusing on the smallest of details. Walsh made everyone in the football team and in the administrative departments follow their respective processes. Long story short: <i>the score took care of itself</i>. The 49ers won 3 super bowls among other impressive performances.</div><div><br /></div><div>If I had to do it all again: I would get out of my head. And keep going with a disciplined work ethic. Establish a process. Follow the process. And let the results take care of themselves.</div><div><br /></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div><b>All’s Well That Ends Well</b></div><div><br /></div><div>I grinded and hustled and successfully completed my Masters degree. However, instead of making the journey a joyride, I got in my own way and complicated things for no good reason.</div><div><br /></div><div><b> Final Thoughts</b></div><div><br /></div><div>As William James said, a person can change his life by changing his attitude. All I needed to do was change my thinking -- work hard -- and the “score would have taken care of itself”.</div><div><br /></div><div>I thought I was alone. But I found out in other spheres that a non-negligent percentage of people fall prey to the impostor syndrome. I wanted to write this to help any student who may be going through the problem that I did. If you are going through self-doubt, my message to you is to get out of the head, believe that you are capable (and make no mistake, you certainly are), do the work diligently,</div><div>follow the process, and <i>let the score take care of itself</i>.</div><div><br /></div></div></div>

Recently it was shown that  PLS is not contained in PPADS (ECCC report TR22-058). We show that this separation already implies that PLS is not contained in PPP. These separations are shown for the decision tree model of TFNP and imply similar separations in the type-2, relativized model.

Important note. This manuscript is based on an early preprint of report TR22-058, which did not contain the result that PLS is not contained in PPP. Our work is superseded by  the revised version of the report of 10 June 2022 which, independently, contains this result. The manuscript has not been edited to reflect this, and in particular references to the report are to the early version.</div>

<p><a href="https://ima.org.uk/19140/westward-ho-conway-concorde-and-curiously-curved-coins/">The Institute of Mathematics &amp; its Applications tells us</a> that applications of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuleaux_triangle">Reuleaux triangle</a> include “the cross-section of some pencils that are thought to be more ergonomic than traditional hexagonal ones”. It it true?</p>

<p>It’s a bit difficult to tell, because there are many brands of triangular pencil and they don’t all come with easy-to-interpret cross-sections or dimensions. A true Reuleaux triangle pencil would have a cross section with rounded sides and 120° corners, making the same angle as the corners of a hexagonal pencil, as shown in the upper left cross-section of the figure below.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/tri-pencils.svg" alt="Hypothetical cross-sections of triangular and hexagonal pencils: upper left, Reuleaux triangle; upper right, hexagon; lower left, flat triangle with rounded corners; lower-right, smooth three-lobed curve of constant width" /></p>

<p>Instead, all the ones I found online appear to fall into two other classes of shapes: flat-sided triangles with rounded-off corners (lower left of the figure) or smooth three-lobed shapes with no corners at all (lower right). Here are some:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The best image I could find of the Dixon Tri-Conderoga is <a href="https://woodclinched.com/2010/09/15/tri-conderoga/">this brief post by Woodclinched</a>. It appears to be a smooth three-lobed shape. Dixon also produce a “Tri-Write” triangular pencil, aimed at a lower-level market than the Tri-Conderoga; the <a href="https://dixonticonderogacompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021_Dixon-Prod-Catalog_04.21.pdf">2021 Dixon product catalog</a> shows both it and the Tri-Conderoga as having a cross-section with slightly rounded sides (flatter than a Reuleaux triangle but not completely flat) and rounded corners.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Faber-Castell Grip 2001 is another three-sided pencil, with added bumps on its sides to make it grippier. If we ignore the bumps for the purpose of determining its shape, <a href="https://www.penciltalk.org/2008/10/faber-castell-grip-2001-and-jumbo-grip-in-alternate-finishes">Pencil Talk shows it as a flat triangle with rounded corners</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Koh-I-Noor Triograph, as shown in <a href="https://www.penciltalk.org/2007/09/koh-i-noor-hardmuth-triograph-1830-pencil">a review by Pencil Talk</a>, has rounded corners, and flat-enough sides to clearly print the brand name in large letters on it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Lyra Ferby is a German children’s brand with a smooth three-lobed shape.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Marco Grip-Rite appears, from <a href="https://polarpencilpusher.home.blog/2019/07/11/pencil-review-marco-grip-rite-2b-w-bonus-sharpener/">its review by Polar Pencil Pusher</a>, to have a smooth three-lobed cross-section, even though the review calls it a Reuleaux triangle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://micador.com.au/products/micador-jr-colourush-jumbo-pencils-fsc-100">Micador ColouRush Jumbo Triangular Pencils</a> (an Asutralian branch of children’s pencils) have a cross-section image on the manufacturer website clearly showing a flat triangle with rounded corners.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PaperMate make several triangular writing tools under the “Handwriting” brand, including PaperMate Handwriting woodcase pencils, aimed at children. I couldn’t find a good image of a cross-section of one, but their mechanical pencil in the same branch is clearly a smooth three-lobed shape. <a href="https://www.pencilrevolution.com/2019/03/papermate-handwriting-pencil/">Pencil Revolution</a> appears to show a similar shape for the wood pencils.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I don’t know what brand of pencils the IMA used for the photo of their example, but it appears to be one with flat sides and rounded corners.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I also didn’t find pencils with flat-sided triangles (and non-rounded or only very lightly rounded corners) as their cross-sections. But if you search for “triangle pencil” you will find plenty of colorful plastic things with that shape that you can slide over your pencil to make it easier to hold.</p>

<p>I can’t tell you whether any of these are any good to write or draw with; for that, I prefer fountain pens. (I don’t have an <a href="https://www.fountainpennetwork.com/forum/topic/229621-modern-pens-the-omas-360/">Omas 360</a>, but that one really does appear to be based on a Reuleaux triangle.) Beyond writing, if you’re hoping for a pencil that doubles as a constant-width roller for rolling your books smoothly across your desk, and don’t want boring circular pencils, the smooth three-lobed ones may be your best bet. The one I drew above really is a curve of constant width. It’s just not a Reuleaux triangle.</p>

<p>This has been yet another episode of “things that are not Reuleaux triangles”. See previously <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/11/27/study-triangular-bottle.html">a triangular bottle</a>, <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/11/15/linkage.html">the Kölntriangle</a>, <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/11/02/constant-width-involutes.html">rotors within rotors</a>, <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/08/30/linkage.html">a Polish football logo</a>, <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/07/05/shape-wankel-rotor.html">Wankel engines, and many more</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>I have some exciting news (for me, anyway).  Starting next week, I’ll be going on leave from UT Austin for one year, to work at <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>.  They’re the creators of the astonishing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT-3</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">DALL-E2</a>, which have not only endlessly entertained me and my kids, but recalibrated my understanding of what, for better and worse, the world is going to look like for the rest of our lives.  Working with an amazing team at OpenAI, including <a href="https://jan.leike.name/">Jan Leike</a>, <a href="http://joschu.net/">John Schulman</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever">Ilya Sutskever</a>, my job will be think about the theoretical foundations of AI safety and alignment.  What, if anything, can computational complexity contribute to a principled understanding of how to get an AI to do what we want and not do what we don’t want?</p>



<p>Yeah, I don’t know the answer either.  That’s why I’ve got a whole year to try to figure it out!  One thing I know for sure, though, is that I’m interested <em>both</em> in the short-term, where new ideas are now quickly testable, and where the misuse of AI for spambots, surveillance, propaganda, and other nefarious purposes is already a major societal concern, <em>and</em> the long-term, where one might worry about what happens once AIs surpass human abilities across nearly every domain.  (And all the points in between: we might be in for a long, wild ride.)  When you start reading about AI safety, it’s striking how there are two separate communities—the one mostly worried about machine learning perpetuating racial and gender biases, and the one mostly worried about superhuman AI turning the planet into goo—who not only don’t work together, but are <em>at each other’s throats</em>, with each accusing the other of totally missing the point.  I persist, however, in the possibly-naïve belief that these are merely two extremes along a single continuum of AI worries.  By figuring out how to align AI with human values today—constantly confronting our theoretical ideas with reality—we can develop knowledge that will give us a better shot at aligning it with human values tomorrow.</p>



<p>For family reasons, I’ll be doing this work mostly from home, in Texas, though traveling from time to time to OpenAI’s office in San Francisco.  I’ll <em>also</em> spend 30% of my time continuing to run the Quantum Information Center at UT Austin and working with my students and postdocs.  At the end of the year, I plan to go back to full-time teaching, writing, and thinking about quantum stuff, which remains my main intellectual love in life, even as AI—the field where I started, as a PhD student, before I switched to quantum computing—has been taking over the world in ways that none of us can ignore.</p>



<p>Maybe fittingly, this new direction in my career had its origins here on <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>.  Several commenters, including <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6288#comment-1928020">Max Ra</a> and <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6288#comment-1928039">Matt Putz</a>, asked me point-blank what it would take to induce me to work on AI alignment.  Treating it as an amusing hypothetical, I replied that it wasn’t mostly about money for me, and that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The central thing would be finding an actual <em>potentially-answerable technical question</em> around AI alignment, even just a small one, that piqued my interest and that I felt like I had an unusual angle on. In general, I have an absolutely terrible track record at working on topics because I abstractly feel like I “should” work on them. My entire scientific career has basically just been letting myself get nerd-sniped by one puzzle after the next.</p></blockquote>



<p>Anyway, Jan Leike at OpenAI saw this exchange and wrote to ask whether I was serious in my interest.  Oh shoot!  Was I?  After intensive conversations with Jan, others at OpenAI, and others in the broader AI safety world, I finally concluded that I was.</p>



<p>I’ve obviously got my work cut out for me, just to catch up to what’s already been done in the field.  I’ve actually been in the Bay Area all week, meeting with numerous AI safety people (<em>and</em>, of course, complexity and quantum people), carrying a stack of technical papers on AI safety everywhere I go.  I’ve been struck by how, when I talk to AI safety experts, they’re not only <em>not dismissive</em> about the potential relevance of complexity theory, they’re more gung-ho about it than I am!  They want to talk about whether, say, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_(complexity)">IP=PSPACE</a>, or <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~fortnow/papers/mip2.pdf">MIP=NEXP</a>, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCP_theorem">PCP theorem</a> could provide key insights about how we could verify the behavior of a powerful AI.  (Short answer: maybe, on some level!  But, err, more work would need to be done.)</p>



<p>How did this complexitophilic state of affairs come about?  That brings me to another wrinkle in the story.  Traditionally, students follow in the footsteps of their professors.  But in trying to bring complexity theory into AI safety, I’m actually following in the footsteps of my student: <a href="https://paulfchristiano.com/">Paul Christiano</a>, one of the greatest undergrads I worked with in my nine years at MIT, the student whose course project turned into the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4740">Aaronson-Christiano quantum money paper</a>.  After MIT, Paul did a PhD in quantum computing at Berkeley, with my own former adviser Umesh Vazirani, while <em>also</em> working part-time on AI safety.  Paul then left quantum computing to work on AI safety full-time—indeed, along with others such as Dario Amodei, he helped start the safety group at OpenAI.  Paul has since left to found his own AI safety organization, the <a href="https://alignment.org/">Alignment Research Center (ARC)</a>, although he remains on good terms with the OpenAI folks.  Paul is largely responsible for bringing complexity theory intuitions and analogies into AI safety—for example, through the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00899">“AI safety via debate” paper</a> and the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08575">Iterated Amplification paper</a>.  I’m grateful for Paul’s guidance and encouragement—as well as that of the others now working in this intersection, like Geoffrey Irving and Elizabeth Barnes—as I start this new chapter.</p>



<p>So, what projects will I actually work on at OpenAI?  Yeah, I’ve been spending the past week trying to figure that out.  I still don’t know, but a few possibilities have emerged.  First, I might work out a general theory of sample complexity and so forth for learning in dangerous environments—i.e., learning where making the wrong query might kill you.  Second, I might work on explainability and interpretability for machine learning: given a deep network that produced a particular output, what do we even mean by an “explanation” for “why” it produced that output?  What can we say about the computational complexity of finding that explanation?  Third, I might work on the ability of weaker agents to verify the behavior of stronger ones.  Of course, if P≠NP, then the gap between the difficulty of solving a problem and the difficulty of recognizing a solution can sometimes be enormous.  And indeed, even in empirical machine learing, there’s typically a gap between the difficulty of <em>generating</em> objects (say, cat pictures) and the difficulty of <em>discriminating</em> between them and other objects, the latter being easier.  But this gap typically isn’t exponential, as is conjectured for NP-complete problems: it’s much smaller than that.  And counterintuitively, we can then turn around and use the generators to improve the discriminators.  How can we understand this abstractly?  Are there model scenarios in complexity theory where we can prove that something similar happens?  How far can we amplify the generator/discriminator gap—for example, by using interactive protocols, or debates between competing AIs?</p>



<p>OpenAI, of course, has the word “open” right in its name, and a founding mission “to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.”  But it’s also a for-profit enterprise, with investors and paying customers and serious competitors.  So throughout the year, don’t expect me to share any proprietary information—that’s not my interest anyway, even if I <em>hadn’t</em> signed an NDA.  But <em>do</em> expect me to blog my general thoughts about AI safety as they develop, and to solicit feedback from readers.</p>



<p>In the past, I’ve often been skeptical about the prospects for superintelligent AI becoming self-aware and destroying the world anytime soon (see, for example, my 2008 post <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=346">The Singularity Is Far</a>).  While I was aware since 2005 or so of the AI-risk community; and of its leader and prophet, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a>; and of Eliezer’s exhortations for people to drop everything else they’re doing and work on AI risk, as the biggest issue facing humanity, I … kept the whole thing at arms’ length.  Even <em>supposing</em> I agreed that this was a huge thing to worry about, I asked, what on earth do you want me to do about it today?  We know so little about a future superintelligent AI and how it would behave that any actions we took today would likely be useless or counterproductive.</p>



<p>Over the past 15 years, though, my and Eliezer’s views underwent a dramatic and ironic reversal.  If you read Eliezer’s <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uMQ3cqWDPHhjtiesc/agi-ruin-a-list-of-lethalities">“litany of doom”</a> from two weeks ago, you’ll see that he’s now resigned and fatalistic: because his early warnings weren’t heeded, he argues, humanity is almost certainly doomed and an unaligned AI will soon destroy the world.  He says that there are basically <em>no</em> promising directions in AI safety research: for any alignment strategy anyone points out, Eliezer can trivially refute it by explaining how (e.g.) the AI would be wise to the plan, and would pretend to go along with whatever we wanted from it while secretly plotting against us.</p>



<p>The weird part is, just as Eliezer became more and more pessimistic about the prospects for getting anywhere on AI alignment, I’ve become more and more <em>optimistic</em>.  Part of my optimism is because people like Paul Christiano have laid foundations for a meaty mathematical theory: much like the Web (or quantum computing theory) in 1992, it’s still in a ridiculously primitive stage, but even <em>my</em> limited imagination now suffices to see how much more could be built there.  An even greater part of my optimism is because we now live in a world with GPT-3, DALL-E2, and other systems that, while they clearly aren’t AGIs, are powerful enough that worrying about AGIs has come to seem more like prudence than like science fiction. And we can finally test our intuitions against the realities of these systems, which (outside of mathematics) is pretty much the only way human beings have ever succeeded at anything.</p>



<p>I didn’t predict that machine learning models this impressive would exist by 2022.  Most of you probably didn’t predict it.  For godsakes, <em>Eliezer Yudkowsky</em> didn’t predict it.  But it’s happened.  And to my mind, one of the defining virtues of science is that, when empirical reality gives you a clear shock, you update and adapt, rather than expending your intelligence to come up with clever reasons why it doesn’t matter or doesn’t count.</p>



<p>Anyway, so that’s the plan!  If I can figure out a way to save the galaxy, I will, but I’ve set my goals slightly lower, at learning some new things and doing some interesting research and writing some papers about it and enjoying a break from teaching.  Wish me a non-negligible success probability!</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p><strong>Update (June 18):</strong> To respond to a couple criticisms that I’ve seen elsewhere on social media…</p>



<p><strong>Can the rationalists sneer at me for waiting to get involved with this subject until it had become sufficiently “respectable,” “mainstream,” and ”high-status”? </strong> I suppose they can, if that’s their inclination.  I suppose I should be grateful that so many of them chose to respond instead with messages of congratulations and encouragement.   Yes, I plead guilty to keeping this subject at arms-length until I could point to GPT-3 and DALL-E2 and the other dramatic advances of the past few years to justify the reality of the topic to anyone who might criticize me.  It <em>feels</em> internally like I had principled reasons for this: I can think of almost no examples of research programs that succeeded over decades even in the teeth of opposition from the scientific mainstream.  If so, then arguably the best time to get involved with a “fringe” scientific topic, is when and only when you can foresee a path to it <em>becoming</em> the scientific mainstream.  At any rate, that’s what I did with quantum computing, as a teenager in the mid-1990s.  It’s what many scientists of the 1930s did with the prospect of nuclear chain reactions.  And if I’d optimized for getting the right answer earlier, I might’ve had to weaken the filters and let in a bunch of dubious worries that would’ve paralyzed me.  But I admit the possibility of self-serving bias here.</p>



<p><strong>Should you worry that OpenAI is just hiring me to be able to say “look, we have Scott Aaronson working on the problem,” rather than actually caring about what its safety researchers come up with? </strong> I mean, I can’t prove that you <em>shouldn’t</em> worry about that.  In the end, whatever work I do on the topic will have to speak for itself.  For whatever it’s worth, though, I was impressed by the OpenAI folks’ detailed, open-ended engagement with these questions when I met them—sort of like how it might look if they actually believed what they said about wanting to get this right for the world.  I wouldn’t have gotten involved otherwise.</p></div>

<p>The <a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2022/">54th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing</a> (STOC’22) is starting next week in Rome, as part of the broader TheoryFest. Now, while this probably is not coming as a surprise to you, did you now about the <em>social and mentoring events</em> at STOC, which, not to miss a good portmanteau when one sees one,* we shall refer henceforth as <em>STOCial’22?</em></p>



<p>Organised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/uniroma1.it/federicofusco/home">Federico Fusco</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~teganwilson/">Tegan Wilson</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/marywootters/">Mary Wootters</a>, and myself, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/stocial-2022">STOCial’22</a> includes a bonanza of activities, games, and fun, including (but not limited to):</p>



<ul><li>a student lunch!</li><li>two senior/junior lunches!</li><li>cartoon caption contests!</li><li>a scavenger hunt! <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f9e9.png" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt="🧩" /></li><li>a STOC-themed crossword!</li><li>a game of socc… football! <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/26bd.png" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt="⚽" /></li><li>PRIZES! <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f3c6.png" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt="🏆" /></li></ul>
