<p>
Scott Aaronson is one of the top researchers in complexity theory and especially in quantum computing. He is famous for more than his research, he is famous also for his blog <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?m=202109">Shtetl-Optimized</a>. Its scope includes just about everything that touches on complexity theory, but includes many topics that span just about anything that is interesting these days.</p>
<p>
For a whole week, he has had the topic: <i>Exciting opportunities at Kabul University!</i> </p>
<p>
Scott is kidding about Kabul of course. Rather, his topic is the recent Texas law against abortion. Here are his initial comments: </p>
<blockquote><p>
Now, of course, Texas has effectively outlawed abortion—well, after the 6th week, which is before many women even realize they’re pregnant, and when the fetus is still the size of a grain of rice…</p>
<p>
There are no exceptions for rape or incest, and—this is the “novel” part—there’s a bounty system, with $10,000 fines for anyone who helps in any way with an abortion, payable to anyone who snitches on them. Texas has openly defied Roe v. Wade and, for the first time in half a century, has gotten five Supreme Court justices (three appointed by Donald Trump) to go along with it. Roe v. Wade is de facto no longer the law of the United States.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
We will not talk about abortion, but rather the novel aspect of the Texas law. This will not lead to quantum computing, not even along lines of a famous SMBC <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/the-talk-3">cartoon</a> that Scott created with Zach Weinersmith, from which we give the second panel:</p>

<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/09/13/texas-sized-problems/the-talk/" rel="attachment wp-att-19098"><img width="480" alt="" src="https://i2.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/the-talk.jpg?resize=480%2C270&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-19098" height="270" /></a></p>
<p>
We promise it will lead to some math, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Texas Law </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What can we do to stop the Texas law? Many are worried that the fact that the US Supreme Court has refused to even temporarily block the Texas law is unheard of. Does this mean that the new Texas law somehow is valid? Does this mean that abortions will be made illegal? Not clear.</p>
<p>
One part of the Texas law is clever—we can disagree with it and still note that the new law is clever. The law does not give the usual suspects to the local law enforcement, who are usually the ones responsible to enforce the law. Rather the law insists that anyone can raise the issue that X has violated the law against an abortion. Say S raises that X helped make an abortion happen. Then S gets $10,000 payment provided the case is upheld in court. Scott calls S the <i>snitches</i>. </p>
<p>
As recognized by the Emergency Medical Network (Emnet), this step in moving the enforcement from the usual police to the general public is one of the reasons the Texas law is so hard to fight. The usual way to challenge a new law is to immediately file some counter suit stopping those charged with enforcement. This seems to be impossible with this trick. Who can be S?—by construction that could be just about anyone. There is no single body to force to defend the law in court. Clever.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Texas Law—The Trick </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We are experts in theory of computation. Can we use that ability to find a way to attack the new <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB8/id/2395961">law</a>? Can we see any weakness that is inherent in the law? Some trick? Or is the Texas idea somehow a breakthrough in ways to state a law against abortion?</p>
<p>
Ken and I have an insight. A standard trick in theory is given a new idea can we generalize it. If we can use the new idea to solve other problems then we should shed some light on the new idea. If the idea is too powerful, then we essentially prove that it cannot work in general. If it does work elsewhere, then we can use it to solve previous unsolved problems. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Texas Law for Speeding </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Cars speeding is a serious problem just about everywhere. I live in a rural area and it is 35 mph here. </p>
<p></p><p><br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/09/13/texas-sized-problems/attachment/35/" rel="attachment wp-att-19100"><img width="196" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/35.png?resize=196%2C114&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19100" height="114" /></a></p>
<p>
Yet when I am driving I am often passed by cars that cross a yellow line going 50 or faster. The issue is that the laws insist that some officer witness a violation. But since that rarely happens, the speeders almost always get no ticket.</p>
<p>
Let’s use the same trick that is used in the new Texas law. If a car races by me then I will send a digital message to the police that says: “Today I was driving my car number <b>1236335356</b> at time <b>11:19.42am</b> and witnessed a car with plate number <b>ERRW5365</b> speeding at <b>55.11mph</b> while passing me. I was at location …</p>
<p>
This would be sent to the police and they would then have the task of checking it out. Provided it checks out, I would be awarded a bounty of $500, say. And the speeder would get a fine and …</p>
<p>
How could I prove the speed? I wouldn’t have time to take a video in the moment. But Ken’s smartphone—and those of many of his colleagues—have an app that is solving problems of this type 24/7. His is a University at Buffalo product but there are many similar ones. Quoting the <a href="https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/pocketcares.html">website</a> makes everything quickly clear:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> PocketCare S is a bluetooth low energy (BLE) solution which enables smartphones to send and receive anonymous beacon signals. It checks the distance between a smartphone and another beacon (or smartphone running PocketCare S) … [and] … records the duration a close encounter with another beacon. PocketCare S is designed to report social distance information without collecting or revealing any personally identifiable information about any specific individual. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The car would only need to have a detectable beacon, not the same app—and the info giving proof of speed over said duration might already be in the authorities’ data banks even before the complaint is filed.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Bipartite Epidemiology? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Of course, what we are trying to say is that this kind of lawsuit would become a new kind of virus. It might extend to many other transgressions besides speeding. What strikes us further is that this would assume a binary structure that we do not know to exist in medical pandemics.</p>
<p>
The first point is that the people who voted for the Texas law believe they are not the ones who would be violating it. Call them Team A. The remaining people—Team 2—would want to get back at them. Maybe speeding is an equal vice for those two teams, so that wouldn’t work. We’ve seen suggestions like Team B suing for open-carry of firearms. Let us just suppose Team B finds something.</p>
<p>
The second point is that a “snitch” lawsuit is like one person infecting another. But unlike our present pandemic, it’s one where people in A can only infect those in B, and vice versa. We have a bipartite graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28A%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{(A,B)}" class="latex" />. How does this change the math?</p>
<p>
One issue noted by Scott in a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5807#comment-1908708">comment</a> is whether the law allows someone to be sued multiple times. If not, then being sued once would be like acquiring immunity. The US recognizes principles of “no double jeopardy” but the Texas law appears to avoid them. </p>
<p>
We’ve tried to look for related analysis of the popular college “Humans Versus Zombies” (<a href="https://humansvszombies.org/">HvZ</a>) game. But in that game, the zombies only increase. <em>Scientific American</em> once published an <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/lab-rat/modelling-a-werewolf-epidemic-2/">analysis</a> titled, “Modelling a werewolf epidemic” that also mentioned zombies. But it did not say the werewolves could only infect zombies and vice-versa. </p>
<p>
Binary infection situations do of course exist when two groups of people suddenly mix, each having already acquired resistance to a disease that infects the other. There have been great tragedies when the mixing was a relatively small number of A colonizing into B. But we still do not know of models that would apply when the kinds of “infections” involve spontaneously arise <em>en masse</em> in the manner of a pandemic with high <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{R_0}" class="latex" /> factor—as might happen if the courts really legitimize this kind of “snitch suit” law.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Is this type of snitching a viable adjunct to law enforcement for speeding? Could it save lives? What about the associated dimension of propagating personal information into massive repositories?</p>

<div class="content">
The Alon-Edmonds-Luby distance amplification procedure (FOCS 1995) is an algorithm that transforms a code with vanishing distance to a code with constant distance. AEL was invoked by Kopparty, Meir, Ron-Zewi, and Saraf (J. ACM 2017) for obtaining their state-of-the-art LDC, LCC and LTC. Cohen and Yankovitz (CCC 2021) devised a  procedure that can amplify inverse-polynomial distances, exponentially extending the regime of distances that can be amplified by AEL. However, the improved procedure only works for LDC and assuming rate $1-\frac1{\mathrm{poly} \log n}$.

In this work we devise a distance amplification procedure for LCC with inverse-polynomial distances even for vanishing rate $\frac1{\mathrm{poly} \log\log n}$. For LDC, we obtain a more modest improvement and require rate $1-\frac1{\mathrm{poly} \log\log n}$. Thus, the tables have turned and it is now LCC that can be better amplified. Our key idea for accomplishing this, deviating from prior work, is to tailor the distance amplification procedure to the code at hand.

Our second result concerns the relation between linear LDC and LCC. We prove the existence of linear LDC that are not LCC, qualitatively extending a separation by Kaufman and Viderman (RANDOM 2010).</div>

We suggest a general framework to study dependency schemes for dependency quantified Boolean formulas (DQBF). As our main contribution, we exhibit a new infinite collection of implication-free DQBF dependency schemes that generalise the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme. We establish soundness of all these schemes, implying that they can be used in any DQBF proof system. We further explore the power of QBF and DQBF resolution systems parameterised by implication-free dependency schemes and show that the hierarchical structure naturally present among the dependency schemes translates isomorphically to a hierarchical structure of parameterised proof systems with respect to p-simulation. As a special case, we demonstrate that our new schemes are exponentially stronger than the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme when used in Q-resolution, thus resulting in the strongest QBF dependency schemes known to date.</div>

Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) to data. This supervised learning task is
efficiently solvable in the realizable setting, but is known to be
computationally hard with adversarial label noise. In this work, we focus on
ReLU regression in the Massart noise model, a natural and well-studied
semi-random noise model. In this model, the label of every point is generated
according to a function in the class, but an adversary is allowed to change
this value arbitrarily with some probability, which is {\em at most} $\eta &lt;
1/2$. We develop an efficient algorithm that achieves exact parameter recovery
in this model under mild anti-concentration assumptions on the underlying
distribution. Such assumptions are necessary for exact recovery to be
information-theoretically possible. We demonstrate that our algorithm
significantly outperforms naive applications of $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$
regression on both synthetic and real data.

permutations to estimate the Jaccard similarity in massive binary (0/1) data,
where $K$ can be (e.g.,) 1024 or even larger, depending on applications. The
recent work on C-MinHash (Li and Li, 2021) has shown, with rigorous proofs,
that only two permutations are needed. An initial permutation is applied to
break whatever structures which might exist in the data, and a second
permutation is re-used $K$ times to produce $K$ hashes, via a circulant
shifting fashion. (Li and Li, 2021) has proved that, perhaps surprisingly, even
though the $K$ hashes are correlated, the estimation variance is strictly
smaller than the variance of the traditional MinHash.
</p>
<p>It has been demonstrated in (Li and Li, 2021) that the initial permutation in
C-MinHash is indeed necessary. For the ease of theoretical analysis, they have
used two independent permutations. In this paper, we show that one can actually
simply use one permutation. That is, one single permutation is used for both
the initial pre-processing step to break the structures in the data and the
circulant hashing step to generate $K$ hashes. Although the theoretical
analysis becomes very complicated, we are able to explicitly write down the
expression for the expectation of the estimator. The new estimator is no longer
unbiased but the bias is extremely small and has essentially no impact on the
estimation accuracy (mean square errors). An extensive set of experiments are
provided to verify our claim for using just one permutation.

set of cycles that generates the $1$-dimensional homology classes with
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients in a given simplicial complex $K$. This problem has
been extensively studied in the last few years.
</p>
<p>For general complexes, the current best deterministic algorithm, by Dey et
al., runs in $O(N^\omega + N^2 g)$ time, where $N$ denotes the number of
simplices in $K$, $g$ denotes the rank of the $1$-homology group of $K$, and
$\omega$ denotes the exponent of matrix multiplication. In this paper, we
present two conceptually simple randomized algorithms that compute a minimum
homology basis of a general simplicial complex $K$. The first algorithm runs in
$\tilde{O}(m^\omega)$ time, where $m$ denotes the number of edges in $K$,
whereas the second algorithm runs in $O(m^\omega + N m^{\omega-1})$ time.
</p>
<p>We also study the problem of finding a minimum cycle basis in an undirected
graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. The best known algorithm for this
problem runs in $O(m^\omega)$ time. Our algorithm, which has a simpler
high-level description, but is slightly more expensive, runs in
$\tilde{O}(m^\omega)$ time.

important task. We consider the problem of clustering a set of points while
ensuring fairness constraints. While there have been several attempts to
capture group fairness in the k-clustering problem, fairness at an individual
level is not well-studied. We introduce a new notion of individual fairness in
k-clustering based on features that are not necessarily used for clustering. We
show that this problem is NP-hard and does not admit a constant factor
approximation. We then design a randomized algorithm that guarantees
approximation both in terms of minimizing the clustering distance objective as
well as individual fairness under natural restrictions on the distance metric
and fairness constraints. Finally, our experimental results validate that our
algorithm produces lower clustering costs compared to existing algorithms while
being competitive in individual fairness.

tables continue to be the focus of a great deal of both theoretical and
empirical research. A central reason for this is that many of the fundamental
properties that one desires from a hash table are difficult to achieve
simultaneously; thus many variants offering different trade-offs have been
proposed.
</p>
<p>This paper introduces Iceberg hashing, a hash table that simultaneously
offers the strongest known guarantees on a large number of core properties.
Iceberg hashing supports constant-time operations while improving on the state
of the art for space efficiency, cache efficiency, and low failure probability.
Iceberg hashing is also the first hash table to support a load factor of up to
$1 - o(1)$ while being stable, meaning that the position where an element is
stored only ever changes when resizes occur. In fact, in the setting where keys
are $\Theta(\log n)$ bits, the space guarantees that Iceberg hashing offers,
namely that is uses at most $\log \binom{|U|}{n} + O(n \log \log n)$ bits to
store $n$ items from a universe $U$, matches a lower bound by Demaine et al.
that applies to any stable hash table.
</p>
<p>Iceberg hashing introduces new general-purpose techniques for some of the
most basic aspects of hash-table design. Notably, our indirection-free
technique for dynamic resizing, which we call waterfall addressing, and our
techniques for achieving stability and very-high probability guarantees, can be
applied to any hash table that makes use of the front-yard/backyard paradigm
for hash table design.

combinatorial optimization, which is well understood in the offline setting.
However, the corresponding online setting has been handled only briefly in the
theoretical computer science literature so far, although it appears in several
applications. Even the previously best known guarantee for the competitive
ratio was worse than the best known for the integral problem in the popular
random order model. We show that there is an algorithm for the online
fractional knapsack problem that admits a competitive ratio of 4.39. Our result
significantly improves over the previously best known competitive ratio of 9.37
and surpasses the current best 6.65-competitive algorithm for the integral
case. Moreover, our algorithm is deterministic in contrast to the randomized
algorithms achieving the results mentioned above.

Boolean CSPs. The smoothed model is a hybrid between worst and average-case
input models, where the input is an arbitrary instance of the CSP with only the
negation patterns of the literals re-randomized with some small probability.
For an $n$-variable smoothed instance of a $k$-arity CSP, our algorithm runs in
$n^{O(\ell)}$ time, and succeeds with high probability in bounding the optimum
fraction of satisfiable constraints away from $1$, provided that the number of
constraints is at least $\tilde{O}(n) (\frac{n}{\ell})^{\frac{k}{2} - 1}$. This
matches, up to polylogarithmic factors in $n$, the trade-off between running
time and the number of constraints of the state-of-the-art algorithms for
refuting fully random instances of CSPs [RRS17].
</p>
<p>We also make a surprising new connection between our algorithm and even
covers in hypergraphs, which we use to positively resolve Feige's 2008
conjecture, an extremal combinatorics conjecture on the existence of even
covers in sufficiently dense hypergraphs that generalizes the well-known Moore
bound for the girth of graphs. As a corollary, we show that polynomial-size
refutation witnesses exist for arbitrary smoothed CSP instances with number of
constraints a polynomial factor below the "spectral threshold" of $n^{k/2}$,
extending the celebrated result for random 3-SAT of Feige, Kim and Ofek
[FKO06].

shortest path between two nodes in a network subject to a given constraint set.
It is typically processed as a \textit{skyline path} problem. However, the
number of intermediate skyline paths becomes larger as the network size
increases and the constraint number grows, which brings about the dramatical
growth of computational cost and further makes the existing index-based methods
hardly capable of obtaining the complete exact results. In this paper, we
propose a novel high-dimensional skyline path concatenation method to avoid the
expensive skyline path search, which then supports the efficient construction
of hop labeling index for \textit{MCSP} queries. Specifically, a set of
insightful observations and techniques are proposed to improve the efficiency
of concatenating two skyline path set, a \textit{n-Cube} technique is designed
to prune the concatenation space among multiple hops, and a \textit{constraint
pruning} method is used to avoid the unnecessary computation. Furthermore, to
scale up to larger networks, we propose a novel \textit{forest hop labeling}
which enables the parallel label construction from different network
partitions. Our approach is the first method that can achieve both accuracy and
efficiency for \textit{MCSP} query answering. Extensive experiments on
real-life road networks demonstrate the superiority of our method over the
state-of-the-art solutions.

For a function $t : 2^\star \to 1^\star$, let $C_t$ be the set of problems decidable on input $x$ in time at most $t(x)$ almost everywhere.  The Union Theorem of Meyer and McCreight asserts that any union $\bigcup_{i &lt; \omega} C_{t_i}$ for a uniformly recursive sequence of bounds $t_i$ is equal to $C_L$ for some single recursive function $L$. In particular the class PTIME of polynomial-time relations can be expressed as $C_L$ for some total recursive function $L : 2^\star \to 1^\star$. By controlling the complexity of the construction, we show that in fact PTIME equals $C_L$ for some $L$ computable in quasi-polynomial time.</div>

We initiate a study of a new model of property testing that is a hybrid of testing properties of distributions and testing properties of strings. 
Specifically, the new model refers to testing properties of distributions, but these are distributions over huge objects (i.e., very long strings). 
Accordingly, the model accounts for the total number of local probes into these objects (resp., queries to the strings)as well as for the distance between objects (resp., strings).
Specifically, the distance between distributions is defined as the earth mover's distance with respect to the relative Hamming distance between strings.

We study the query complexity of testing in this new model, focusing on three directions.
First, we try to relate the query complexity of testing properties in the new model to the sample complexity of testing these properties in the standard distribution testing model.
Second, we consider the complexity of testing properties that arise naturally in the new model (e.g., distributions that capture random variations of fixed strings).
Third, we consider the complexity of testing properties that were extensively studied in the standard distribution testing model: Two such cases are uniform distributions
and pairs of identical distributions, where we obtain the following results.

\begin{itemize}
\item
Testing whether a distribution over $n$-bit long strings is uniform on some set of size $m$ can be tested with query complexity ${\widetilde O}(m/\epsilon^3)$, where $\epsilon&gt;(\log_2m)/n$ is the proximity parameter.
\item
Testing whether two distribution over $n$-bit long strings that have support size at most $m$ are identical can be tested  with query complexity ${\widetilde O}(m^{2/3}/\epsilon^3)$.
\end{itemize}
Both upper bounds are pretty tight; that is, for $\epsilon=\Omega(1)$, the first task requires $\Omega(m^c)$ queries for any $c&lt;1$ and $n=\omega(\log m)$, whereas the second task requires $\Omega(m^{2/3})$ queries.
Note that the query complexity of the first task is higher than the sample complexity of the corresponding task in the standard distribution testing model, whereas in the case of the second task the bounds almost match.</div>

Boolean circuits are a model of computation. A class of Boolean circuits is called a polynomial class if the number of nodes is bounded by a polynomial function of the number of input variables. A class $C_n[s(n)]$ of Boolean functions is called learnable if there are algorithms that can approximate functions in $C_n[s(n)]$ when given oracle access to the function. A distribution $D$ of functions is called pseudorandom against a circuit class $C[t(n)]$ if any oracle circuit $C^f$ from $C[t(n)]$ outputs 1 with the same probability if the oracle $f$ is chosen from $D$ as it would if the oracle were random. It is known that a polynomial class of circuits is learnable if and only if it contains no pseudorandom distributions of functions. However, there is no known algorithm to produce the learner given the number of inputs the circuits have (the learner is non-uniform). I investigate a uniform version of the min-max theorem as a possible tool to find an algorithm for such learners.</div>

been extensively studied for geospatial point data. At the same time, word
clouds are a popular visualization tool to show the most important words in
text data which has also been extended to visualize geospatial data (Buchin et
al. PacificVis 2016).
</p>
<p>In this paper, we study a hybrid visualization, which combines aspects of
word clouds and point labeling. In the considered setting, the input data
consists of a set of points grouped into categories and our aim is to place
multiple disjoint and axis-aligned rectangles, each representing a category,
such that they cover points of (mostly) the same category under some natural
quality constraints. In our visualization, we then place category names inside
the computed rectangles to produce a labeling of the covered points which
summarizes the predominant categories globally (in a word-cloud-like fashion)
while locally avoiding excessive misrepresentation of points (i.e., retaining
the precision of point labeling).
</p>
<p>We show that computing a minimum set of such rectangles is NP-hard. Hence, we
turn our attention to developing heuristics and exact SAT models to compute our
visualizations. We evaluate our algorithms quantitatively, measuring running
time and quality of the produced solutions, on several artificial and
real-world data sets. Our experiments show that the heuristics produce
solutions of comparable quality to the SAT models while running much faster.

refolding steps, where each refolding step unfolds the current polyhedron
(allowing cuts anywhere on the surface and allowing overlap) and folds that
unfolding into exactly the next polyhedron; in other words, a polyhedron is
refoldable into another polyhedron if they share a common unfolding.
Specifically, assuming equal surface area, we prove that (1) any two
tetramonohedra are refoldable to each other, (2) any doubly covered triangle is
refoldable to a tetramonohedron, (3) any (augmented) regular prismatoid and
doubly covered regular polygon is refoldable to a tetramonohedron, (4) any
tetrahedron has a 3-step refolding sequence to a tetramonohedron, and (5) the
regular dodecahedron has a 4-step refolding sequence to a tetramonohedron. In
particular, we obtain at most 6-step refolding sequence between any pair of
Platonic solids, applying (5) for the dodecahedron and (1) and/or (2) for all
other Platonic solids. As far as the authors know, this is the first result
about common unfolding involving the regular dodecahedron.

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: How do molecules, cells and synapses effect reasoning, intelligence, planning, language? Despite dazzling progress in experimental neuroscience, as well as in cognitive science at the other extreme of scale, we do not seem to be making progress in the overarching question: the gap is huge and a completely new approach seems to be required. As Richard Axel recently put it: “We don’t have a logic for the transformation of neural activity into thought […].”</p>



<p>What kind of formal system would qualify as this “logic”?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">I will introduce the Assembly Calculus (AC), a computational system which appears to be a promising bridge between neurons and cognition. Through this programming framework, a Parser was recently implemented which (a) can handle reasonably complex sentences of English and other languages, and (b) works exclusively through the spiking of neurons.</p>

Quantified conflict-driven clause learning (QCDCL) is one of the main approaches for solving quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). We formalise and investigate several versions of QCDCL that include cube learning and/or pure-literal elimination, and formally compare the resulting solving models via proof complexity techniques. Our results show that almost all of the QCDCL models are exponentially incomparable with respect to proof size (and hence solver running time), pointing towards different orthogonal ways how to practically implement QCDCL.</div>

Hypercontractive inequalities for real-valued functions over the Boolean cube play an important role in theoretical computer science. In this work, we prove a hypercontractive inequality for matrix-valued functions defined over large alphabets, generalizing the result of Ben-Aroya, Regev, de Wolf (FOCS'08) for the Boolean alphabet. To obtain our result we prove a generalization of the powerful $2$-uniform convexity inequality for trace norms of Ball, Carlen, Lieb (Inventiones Mathematicae'94). We give two applications of this hypercontractive inequality.
    
Locally decodable codes: we present a lower bound for locally decodable codes (LDC) over large alphabets. An LDC $C:\mathbb{Z}_r^n\to \mathbb{Z}_r^N$ is an encoding of $x\in \mathbb{Z}_r^n$ into a codeword $C(x)$ in such a way that one can recover an arbitrary $x_i\in \mathbb{Z}_r$ (with probability at least $1/r+\varepsilon$) by making only a few queries to a corrupted codeword. The main question in LDCs is the trade-off between $N$ and $n$. By using hypercontractivity, we give an exponential lower bound $N= 2^{\Omega(\varepsilon^4 n/r^4)}$ for $2$-query (possibly non-linear) LDCs over $\mathbb{Z}_r$. Previously exponential lower bounds were known for $r=2$ (Kerenidis and de Wolf (JCSS'04)) and for \emph{linear} codes (Dvir and Shpilka (SICOMP'07)).
    
Streaming algorithms: we present upper and lower bounds for the communication complexity of the Hidden Hypermatching problem when defined over large alphabets, which generalizes the well-known Boolean Hidden Matching problem. We then consider streaming algorithms for approximating the value of Unique Games on a $t$-hyperedge hypergraph: in this direction a simple edge-counting argument gives an $r$-approximation with $O(\log n)$ space. On the other hand, we use our communication lower bound to show that every streaming algorithm in the adversarial model achieving a $(r-\varepsilon)$-approximation of this value requires $\Omega(n^{1-1/t})$ classical space or $\Omega(n^{1-2/t})$ quantum space. In this setting, these results simplify and generalize the seminal work of Kapralov, Khanna and Sudan (SODA'15) and Kapravol and Krachun (STOC'19) for the case $r=2$.</div>

<p>Four years ago I <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/01/learning-about-learning.html">tried to catch up with deep learning</a> and this summer I aimed to try to catch up again. Who would've thought 2017 is ancient history.</p><p>I watched the lectures in the <a href="http://introtodeeplearning.com/">latest MIT course</a>, played with GPT-3 and Codex, read the new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258">Stanford manifesto</a> on what they call foundation models, models trained that can preform on a wide range of tasks instead of a single goal. We've seen machine learning solve protein folding, detect cancer from x-rays better than radiologists, not to mention effectively solving many of the traditional AI problems (language translation, voice and face recognition, game playing, etc.) Watching Codex generate computer code from plain English is a game changer. Far from perfect but this technology is in its infancy.</p><p>From what I can tell, the main technological advances focus on learning when we don't have labelled data such as new techniques to transfer knowledge to new domains and using generative models to provide more data to train ML algorithms.</p><p>The trend to worry us all is that deep learning algorithms in the long run seem to do better if we limit or eliminate previous human knowledge from the equation. The game playing algorithms now train from just the rules alone (or even just the outcomes). We do use some knowledge: words come in some linear order, faces have hierarchical features, but not much more than that. Human expertise can help as we start solving a problem, even just to know that good solutions look like, but then it often gets in the way.</p><p>When we longer use a skill we tend to lose it, like my ability to navigate from a good map. If we eliminate expertise we may find it very difficult to get it back.</p><p>There's a more personal issue--people spend their entire careers creating their expertise in some area, and that expertise is often a source of pride and a source of income. If someone comes along and tells you that expertise is no longer needed, or even worse irrelevant or that it gets in the way, you might feel protective, and under guise of our expertise tear down the learning algorithm. That attitude will just make us more irrelevant--better to use our expertise to guide the machine learning models to overcome their limitations. </p><p>You can't stop progress, but you can shape it.</p></div>

<p>I enjoyed reading this book.  Three themes are dear to me:</p>



<p>First, the macabre.  Not that there is any shortage in the news, but the book also contains macabreness of a kind I did not expect.</p>



<p>Second, the drive for scientific research.  It always makes for a compelling read when the reader is a scientist.  And here it is also tinted with adventure.</p>



<p>Third, (recent) history.  As I hinted in some previous posts, I started reading history in my late 20’s, as an unbelievably blank slate, and I haven’t stopped.  It is not clear it is very consequential for the present, but sometimes it’s good to know how things “evolve.”</p></div>

In each category, it is also possible to nominate older papers, up to four years before the target conference. For example, for the thirty-year category, it is possible to nominate papers from FOCS 1987, FOCS 1988, FOCS 1989, FOCS 1990, in addition to the target conference FOCS 1991.</p>
<p>Nominations should be sent by October 31, 2021 to focs.tot.2021@gmail.com with a subject line of “FOCS Test of Time Award”. Nominations should contain an explanation of the impact of the nominated paper(s), including references to follow-on work. Self-nominations are discouraged.</p>
<p>In the second week of November, 2021, the Simons Institute will host a workshop on <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/si2021-3">using cryptographic assumptions to prove average-case hardness of problems in high-dimensional statistics</a>. This is such a new topic that the goal of the workshop will be more to explore new directions than to review known results, and we (think that we have) already invited all the authors of recent published work of this type. If you have proved results of this type, and you have not been invited (perhaps because your results are still unpublished?) and you would like to participate in the workshop, there is still space in the schedule so feel free to contact me or one of the other organizers. For both speakers and attendees, physical participation is preferred, but remote participation will be possible.</p></div>

<p>This month saw four papers. One on group testing, another on distribution testing, yet another which makes progress on testing problems on decision trees and the last one on graph property testing. Without further ado, let’s dive in.  </p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Group Testing with Non-identical Infection Probabilities</strong> by Mustafa Doger, Sennur Ulukus (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12418">arXiv</a>) Consider the classic group testing problem. Here the setup is the following. You are given a bunch of individuals from a population \(\mathcal{P}\). You have an infection vector which records the infection status of each individual in the population where the \(i\)-th individual is infected with probability \(p_i\). You want to recover all the infected individuals. You are allowed to group individuals together and you can test the entire group in a single shot. If the group tests negative, you are happy all the tested individuals are off the hook. Otherwise, if the group tests positive, you need more tests for further classification. This paper proposes a greedy way to build pools of individuals you would test. The pools are built adaptively: as in future pools are built using the knowledge of how the preceding tests fared. The key result in the paper upperbounds the number of tests performed in terms of the entropy of the infection vector.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Uniformity Testing in the Shuffle Model: Simpler, Better, Faster</strong> by Clément L. Canonne, Hongyi Lyu (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08987">arXiv</a>) Differentially private distribution testing as a research area has been gathering momentum steadily over the last few years. If you read our <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2021/08/new-for-july-2021/">last month’s post</a>, you might recall there are a wide variety of models of DP each corresponding to a different “threat model”. The most stringent among the most explored models is the “local model”, the least stringent being the “central model” and there is an intermediate threat model, the so called “<a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2020/05/news-for-april-2020/">shuffle model</a>“. This paper simplifies the analysis of uniformity testing algorithm under the shuffle model and presents an algorithm with sample complexity \(O(k^{3/4})\) for testing uniformity over a support of size \([k]\). </p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>On Learning and Testing Decision Tree</strong> by Nader H. Bshouty, Catherine A. Haddad-Zaknoon (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04587">arXiv</a>) In our <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2021/01/news-for-december-2020/">December 2020</a> post, we covered a result of Blanc et al., which proves the following: Suppose you are given a boolean function \(f\) and the property \(\mathcal{P}\) of size-\(s\) decision trees. The result of Blanc et al gives you a function \(g \in \mathcal{P}\) with \(dist(f,g) = O(dist (f, \mathcal{P}))\) where \(g \in \) is guaranteed to have decision tree complexity \(s^{O(\log^2 s)}\). This result implies a bi-criteria tester for the following property: is \(f \in \mathcal{P}\) or is \(f\) \(\varepsilon\)-far from having decision tree complexity \(\phi(s) = s^{O(\log^3 s)}\). The current paper improves this result by presenting a property tester with \(\phi(s) = s^{O(\log^2 s)}\).   </p>



<p> </p>



<p><strong>The complexity of testing all properties of planar graphs, and the role of isomorphism</strong> by Sabyasachi Basu, Akash Kumar, C. Seshadhri (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10547">arXiv</a>) <em>(Disclaimer: I am one of the authors of this paper)</em>. This paper presents a result that I, in my biased opinion, find interesting. So, here is the setup. You are given a bounded degree planar graph. And I cook up some God-forsaken property and ask you to test it. Turns out, no matter how devilishly I cooked up the property, you can test in with \(\exp(O(\varepsilon^{-2}))\) queries. The nice happenstance is that you also have a matching lower bound of \(\exp(\Omega(\varepsilon^{-2}))\) queries! And interestingly, this lower bound is witnessed by the very natural property of testing isomorphism to a fixed graph which means that isomorphism is the hardest property of  planar graphs.</p></div>

A distribution is called $m$-grained if each element appears with probability that is an integer multiple of $1/m$.
We prove that, for any constant $c&lt;1$, testing whether a distribution over $[\Theta(m)]$ is $m$-grained requires $\Omega(m^c)$ samples.</div>

<p>
  
<br />Motivated by Mathoverflow question
<a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/316708/what-is-the-smallest-unsolved-diophantine-equation">here</a>
I have recently became interested in solving Polynomial Diophantine equations, that is, equations of the form

</p><center>P(x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>n</sub>)=0</center>

<br />for some polynomial P with integer coefficients. Because there are many such equations, I have decided to ask a computer to help me. 
 Our conversation is presented 
 <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/bogdio.pdf">here</a>.

<p>
  
<br /> Highlights of the conversation: the <i>height </i>of a polynomial over Z in many variables is what you get when you make all of the coefficients positive and plug in x=2. For example, the height of
  
  </p><center> x<sup>3</sup> - y<sup>4</sup> + 5</center> 
  
  <br /> is
  
  <center>2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup> + 5 = 8 + 16 + 5 = 29.</center>
  
  <p>
  
 Note that, for all h, there are only a finite number of polynomials in many vars over Z with height h. With the help of my friend the computer we have looked at the equations with h=0,1,2,... and so on, and tried to  determine which ones have any integer solutions. As expected, the first equations were trivial, but at about h=22 we have started to meet quite interesting equations for which we needed help from  Mathoverflow to solve. The project is currently at h=29, with only one remaining open equation of this height.  Read the conversation with the computer, or my mathoverflow question

<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (Sept. 6):</span></strong> Alright, as promised in this post, I’ve now matched a reader’s generosity by donating $2,000 to <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/avow?refcode=20210827NARAL">NARAL’s Avow fund</a>, which is fighting for abortion rights for women in Texas.  Woke people on Twitter, I invite you/youse/y’all to figure out some creative ways to condemn me for that.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>Normally, early fall is the time when I’d use this blog to advertise positions in quantum information and theoretical computer science at the University of Texas at Austin, for prospective PhD students, postdocs, and faculty.  This year, you might say, anyone trying to recruit academics to Texas has a … <em>teensy bit</em> of a PR problem.  We already had PR problems, first over the “failure by design” of our electrical grid in the winter, second over Governor Abbott’s battle against local mask mandates, which has made Texas the second-most notoriously covid-friendly state after Florida.</p>



<p>Now, of course, Texas has <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/texas-republicans-abortion-ban-backfire/619956/?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share&amp;fbclid=IwAR2nCtXtpXUQQ5SBTHJLtd8Fkc8DFwuNCA1gdi3weUBlRqMrU8oKR5YUhjE">effectively outlawed abortion</a>—well, after the 6<sup>th</sup> week, which is before many women even realize they’re pregnant, and when the fetus is still the size of a grain of rice and looks like this.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/6week.jpg" alt="" /></figure></div>



<p>There are no exceptions for rape or incest, and—this is the “novel” part—there’s a bounty system, with $10,000+ fines for anyone who helps in any way with an abortion, payable to anyone who snitches on them.  Texas has openly defied <em>Roe v. Wade</em> and, for the first time in half a century, has gotten five Supreme Court justices (three appointed by Donald Trump) to go along with it.  <em>Roe v. Wade</em> is <em>de facto</em> no longer the law of the United States.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/when.jpg" alt="" /><em>With a 15-week cutoff, a right to abortion would still functionally exist.  At 6 weeks, it no longer functionally exists.</em></figure></div>



<p>And as for our recruiting at UT Austin … I fear we might as well now be trying to recruit colleagues to <a href="https://ku.edu.af/">Kabul University</a>.  It’s like, imagine some department chair at Kabul U., this week, trying to woo a star female physicist from abroad: “Oh, don’t worry … you’ll get used to wearing a burqa in no time!  And the ban on being alone with unrelated males is actually a <em>plus</em> for you; it just means you’ll be freed from onerous teaching and committee assignments.  Best yet, I’ve received personal assurances from our local Taliban commander that you almost certainly won’t be stoned for your licentiousness and whoredom.  Err … no offense, those were his words, not mine.”</p>



<p>For five years, my recruiting pitches for UT Austin have often involved stressing how Austin is a famously hip, tolerant, high-tech, educated city—a “blueberry in the tomato soup,” as Rick Perry put it—and how Texas itself might indeed turn blue any election cycle, given the explosive growth of its metropolitan population, and how the crazy state politics is unlikely to affect an Austinite’s personal life—at least, by noticeably more than the crazy <em>national</em> politics would affect their personal life.  I can no longer make this pitch with a straight face, or certainly not to women.</p>



<p>Like, I’m lucky that none of the women in my close family have ever needed an abortion, and that if they did, it would be easy for them to travel out of Texas to get one.  But having carried to term two healthy but <a href="https://americanpregnancy.org/healthy-pregnancy/pregnancy-complications/hyperemesis-gravidarum/">difficult</a> pregnancies, my wife Dana has often stressed to me how insane she finds the very idea of being <em>forced</em> by the government to go through with such an ordeal.  If women considering moving to Texas feel likewise, I can’t argue with them.  More than that: if Texas continues on what half the country sees as a journey back to the Middle Ages, with no opt-outs allowed for the residents of its left-leaning urban centers, Dana and I will not be able to remain here, and many of our friends won’t either.</p>



<p>So why aren’t we packing our bags already?  Partly because the current situation is inherently, obviously unstable.  <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB8/id/2395961">SB8</a> can’t long remain the law of Texas while <em>Roe v. Wade</em> remains the law of the United States: one of them has to give.  I confess to being confused about why some abortion provider in Texas, with funding from national pro-choice groups, hasn’t <em>already</em> broken the law, welcomed a lawsuit, and forced the courts to rule explicitly on whether <em>Roe v. Wade</em> still stands and why or why not, rather than gutting a core part of American jurisprudence literally under cover of night.  I’m also confused about why some solid blue state, like Massachusetts or Hawaii, isn’t right now passing a law that would let any citizen sue any other for carrying a firearm—thereby forcing the five Supreme Hypocrites, in striking down that law, to admit that they <em>don’t</em> believe after all that state laws get to trample what the Supreme Court has held to be constitutional rights, merely by outsourcing the enforcement to random vigilantes.</p>



<p>My best guess is that Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett are already plotting to replace <em>Roe</em> by something much more restrictive, albeit probably not <em>quite</em> as shockingly draconian as Texas’s current ban on all abortions after six weeks, nor <em>quite</em> as breathtakingly insane as its bounty system for anyone who snitches about abortions.  My best guess is that they saw last week’s ruling as a way to test the waters and soften the country up: if you’re going to rescind what multiple generations of Americans have grown up seeing as a fundamental right, best not to do it too suddenly.  My best guess is that Democrats will respond by making abortion a central campaign issue in 2022 and 2024, and that given the public’s <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/350804/americans-opposed-overturning-roe-wade.aspx">58%-32% support</a> for <em>Roe</em>, the Democrats will do pretty well with that—to the point where, like the proverbial dog that finally catches the car, Republicans might come to regret actually sinking their jaws into <em>Roe</em>, rather than just conspicuously chasing it down the street for half a century.</p>



<p>I have friends who are sincere, thoughtful pro-lifers.  I admire, if nothing else, their principled dedication to a moral stance that regularly gets condemned in academia.  But I’d also say to them: even if <em>you</em> think of abortion as murder, a solid majority of Americans don’t, and it’s hard to see a stable way of getting what you want that skips the step where you change those Americans’ minds.  Indeed, there’s long been a pro-choice critique of <em>Roe</em>, which says that, by short-circuiting the political loosening of abortion restrictions that was already underway in the 70s, <em>Roe</em> fueled the growth of the radical right that’s now all but destroyed America.  For <em>Roe</em> falsely convinced pro-lifers that all they needed to do was seize control of the Supreme Court, by any means fair or foul, when what they <em>really</em> needed to do was convince the public.</p>



<p>And, let’s be honest, convincing the public means convincing them to adopt a religious as opposed to secular framework for morality.  (And not just <em>any</em> religious framework: Orthodox Jews, for example, while not exactly fans of abortion, are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism_and_abortion">fine</a> with it under many circumstances.  In the Jewish view, so the old classic goes, the fetus attains full personhood only after graduating medical school.)  Of the Americans who want abortion to be illegal in all or most cases, <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/views-about-abortion/">94%</a> are at least “fairly certain” that God exists, and 79% are “absolutely certain”—consistent with my experience of having met highly intelligent and articulate pro-lifers, but never <em>secular</em> ones.  Modulo <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/12/noisy-poll-results-and-reptilian-muslim-climatologists-from-mars/">Lizardman’s Constant</a>, virtually <em>all</em> pro-lifers have metaphysical commitments about God and the soul that presumably do some of the heavy lifting for them.  If the case for a blanket abortion ban can be made in terms that are compelling to a secular, rationalist, tradeoffs-based morality, no one seems to have done it yet.</p>



<p>From the standpoint of secular moral philosophy, my own opinion is that no one has ever improved on the <a href="https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/society/on-abortion-carl-sagan-ann-druyan/">searching analysis</a> of the abortion question that Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan published in 1990.  After painstakingly laying out scientific facts, moral hypotheticals, and commonsense principles, Sagan and Druyan ultimately conclude that the right question to ask is when the fetus develops something that’s<em> recognizably a human brain, processing thoughts and emotions</em>.  In practice, that probably means drawing a hard line at the end of the second trimester.  Coincidentally, that’s almost exactly where <em>Roe v. Wade</em> drew the line, but Sagan and Druyan’s reasoning is completely different: they reject <em>Roe</em>‘s criterion of viability outside the womb, as both morally irrelevant and contingent on medical technology.</p>



<p>Reasonable people could disagree with the details of Sagan and Druyan’s analysis.  But <em>if</em> we agree that</p>



<p>(1) a sperm and unfertizilied egg have a “personhood” of 0,</p>



<p>(2) a newborn baby has a “personhood” of 1, and</p>



<p>(3) whatever “personhood” is, it’s somehow tied to the gradual growth of neurons and dendrites in the physical universe, rather than to a mystical and discontinuous moment of ensoulment,</p>



<p>… then by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem">intermediate value theorem</a>, for all p∈(0,1), there’s going to be <em>some</em> stage of fetal development where the fetus has a personhood of p.  Which means that we’re going to be drawing a debatable line, making a compromise, just like the majority did in <em>Roe</em>.  To me, one of the strangest aspects of the abortion debate is how both sides came to view <em>Roe v. Wade</em> as the “pro-choice maximalist position,” forgetting how it itself was an attempted compromise between conflicting moral intuitions.</p>



<p>Another strange aspect of the debate is how the most visible representatives of both sides seem to have given up, decades ago, on actually<em> arguing</em> for their positions.  Maybe it’s because people simply threw up their hands in futility; or because all the ground had been covered with nothing left to say; or because the debate was so obviously entangled with religion, and we have a polite norm of not arguing about religion; or because both positions hardened into tribal identity markers, to be displayed rather than defended.  Whatever the reason, though, by the mid-90s everything became about border skirmishes one or two steps removed from the actual question: e.g., if the woman is under 18, should her parents be notified?  should she be shown pictures of her fetus and given a 24-hour waiting period in hopes she’ll reconsider?  is this judicial nominee hiding his or her anti-abortion views?</p>



<p>Now that Texas and five Supreme Court justices have launched a frontal assault on <em>Roe</em>—it’s impossible to see it any other way—it seems to me that the long armistice is over.  The pro-life side will have to make the case for its moral framework to a populace that will suddenly be paying more attention—and that includes tens of millions of Americans who hadn’t even been born the last time mainstream figures debated abortion head-on.  The pro-choice side can then counterargue for <em>its</em> moral framework.  If any pro-lifers are raring for this fight, I’ll point out that one of the most dramatic demographic changes, since the last time abortion was a “hot war,” has been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_religion_in_the_United_States#Demographics">doubling</a> in the percentage of Americans who are atheist, agnostic, or religiously unaffiliated.</p>



<p>Let me close this post with two things.</p>



<p>Firstly, if anyone is still unclear where I stand: over the next week, I will match <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers’ donations to <a href="https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/">NARAL</a> up to $2,000.  If you’d like to participate, just leave a comment with the amount you donated.  If I’ve argued with certain strains of feminism on this blog, that gives me all the <em>more</em> obligation to support the strains that I regard as fundamentally correct.</p>



<p>Secondly, come join us at the University of Kab … I mean Texas at Austin!  For grad students, <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/graduate/prospective-students/apply">see here</a>; for faculty, <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/faculty/recruiting">see here</a>; for postdocs, email me a CV and recent publications and have two reference letters sent to me by December 31st.  In the US, the east coast is now being ravaged beyond recognition by hurricanes and the west coast by wildfires.  Here in Texas, all <em>we</em> have to deal with is extreme heat, a failing electrical grid, runaway covid, and now the ban on abortion.  Hook ’em Hadamards!</p></div>

<p>I was looking at today's Harvard Crimson, and noted that <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2021/9/3/save-shopping-week-petition/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Harvard's shopping period looks ready to be vanished again</a>.  Shopping period is that wonderful Harvard tradition where students don't preregister for classes, but instead they choose classes after the first week, after having a chance to go to a lecture or two and see how they like it.  I encourage students -- and faculty -- to push back against efforts that restrict student flexibility in choosing their classes.  While administrators hate it, I still think it's better for students to avoid strong forms of preregistration.   </p><p>In fact, I realized I've been fighting this fight for quite a while -- here's <a href="http://mybiasedcoin.blogspot.com/2008/02/more-on-shopping-period.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">something I wrote about when the administration under Larry Summers tried to get rid of it</a>, from this blog back in 2008, and here's a <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2002/10/17/preregistration-plan-slated-for-next-fall/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Crimson article from 2002</a>, where I spoke out against the plan for moving to preregistration that the blog post refers to. </p><p>More recently, in 2018-2019, I found myself on the <a href="https://courseregistration.fas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">"Course Registration Committee"</a>, a committee that initially seemed similarly designed to find a way to move Harvard from shopping period to preregistration.  But a few of us on the committee made convincing arguments that shopping period had many benefits, and the disappearance of shopping period seemed at least somewhat further delayed, while a better solution was found. </p><p>Then the pandemic.  Shopping period seemed impossible in the chaos, and things were more ad hoc (although there was, last year, a push for "class previews" of some sort before the beginning of classes).  This seems to give an opening to remove shopping period again.   </p><p>I'm not saying there aren't ways to change the system to make it better.  I'm not blind to the issues of shopping period -- not having a determined class size before classes begin is problematic for some classes.  I believe the committee people who have continued to look at the issue are trying to make things better going forward.  But the push always seems to be to make a system which is easier for administrators, and somehow correspondingly that is worse for the students.  Students should have the flexibility to see classes and teachers before committing, which to me means either a shopping period, or a structure that allows them to easily change classes for the first couple of weeks with negligible overhead.  I suppose one could design an add/drop system with the flexibility I'd have in mind, but it never seems to work that way in practice -- students end up needing signatures and approvals of various flavors, because (I think) it's in the best interest of administrators to make it hard for students to change classes once classes begin.  (Having 60 people sign up for a class but then having 30 people leave in the first week is possibly worse than the shopping period approach of not having sign-ups before the class at all, but it's a lot easier to disincentivize students from switching out (or in) with a preregistration system, so that problem disappears, at the cost of student flexibility.)  </p><p>As an example of a "non-shopping" issue I've seen this semester, first-year students at Harvard first semester are "limited" to four classes.  (There may be a way to get an exception to this, but I understand it would be rare exception.)  So this semester, with no shopping period, first years have to choose their 4 classes -- without seeing them -- and then manage a confusing add/drop process if they don't like them.  The older students generally know how to play the game -- they sign up for 5 or even 6 classes (if they can) and drop the ones they don't like, because dropping is generally easier than adding.  But first years don't have that flexibility because the 4-course rule is enforced at signup.  (I advise some first year students, and this problem came up.)  </p><p>I'm sure many non-Harvard people reading this think the shopping period system sounds crazy, and maybe a few think Harvard students are bizarrely spoiled.  Perhaps they're right.  But I found as a student it was wonderful, and shaped my future in powerful ways by encouraging me to explore.  You walk into a class you thought you should take, and find the professor puts you to sleep;  or you get dragged to a class by a friend, and find an inspiring subject you had no idea you would like.  I believe my college experience would have been lessened significantly without shopping period.  </p><p>As a faculty member, shopping period is clearly a pain, but I think a manageable one.   Back in 2002-2003, the faculty pushed back against preregistration (<a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/3/12/faculty-blasts-preregistration-several-professors-fiercely/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see this old Crimson article</a>), but it seems opinions have shifted over time;  many faculty seemed to have moved to thinking it's not worth it, which is probably in their own self-interest.  Having been on both sides, I'm still strongly in favor of shopping period.  I suppose if I ever get into administration I may see things differently.  </p><p>I hope there are (younger) defenders out there, in the students and faculty, to push to make sure any changes still favor student choice over administrative convenience, and lead to the best outcomes for students.  </p></div>

Similar to the role of Markov decision processes in reinforcement learning, Markov Games (also called Stochastic Games)lay down the foundation for the study of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and sequential agent interactions. In this paper, we introduce the solution concept, approximate Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE), to finite-state Stochastic Games repeated in the infinite horizon, and prove its $\mathbf{PPAD}$-completeness in computational complexity. Technically, we adopt a function with a polynomially bounded description in the strategy space to convert the MPE computation to a fixed-point problem, even though the stochastic game may demand an exponential number of pure strategies, in the number of states, for each agent. The completeness result follows the reduction of the fixed-point problem to \textsc{End of the Line}.


Past works on the stochastic games are mostly zero-sum MARL algorithms. A $P^{PPAD}$ algorithm for the general sum stochastic games in the finite horizon can be derived to establish an approximation algorithm for the general-sum stochastic games. That implies an approximate NE solution to the infinite-horizon setting. Such a possible extension suffers from three weaknesses: 1. the solution is time-dependent and hence not a perfect equilibrium; 2. the time-dependent solution suffers a weakness of noncredible threats; 3. the time complexity is not tight (lower bound $\mathbf{PPAD}$ and upper bound $P^{PPAD}$). Our result beats such a solution in all those three properties.</div>
