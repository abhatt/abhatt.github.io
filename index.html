<div class="content">
A function f:[n_1] x ... x [n_d]--&gt;F  is a direct sum if it is of the form f(a_1,...,a_d) = f_1(a_1) + ... + f_d (a_d)  (mod 2) for some d functions f_i:[n_i]--&gt;F_i for all i=1,...,d. We present a 4-query test which distinguishes between direct sums and functions that are far from them. The test relies on the BLR linearity test (Blum, Luby, Rubinfeld, 1993) and on an agreement test which slightly generalizes the direct product test.

In multiplicative {+1,-1} notation, our result reads as follows. A d-dimensional tensor with {+1,-1} entries is called a tensor product if it is a tensor product of d vectors with {+1,-1} entries, or equivalently, if it is of rank 1. The presented tests can be read as tests for distinguishing between tensor products and tensors that are far from being tensor products.

We also present a different test, which queries the function at most (d+2) times, but is easier to analyze.</div>

doing large-scale, comprehensive and in-depth analysis of human beings and
their diseases. However, recent regulations like the GDPR require that
sensitive data are stored and elaborated thanks to privacy-by-design methods
and software. We designed and implemented ER-index, a new full-text index in
minute space which was optimized for compressing and encrypting collections of
genomic sequences, and for performing on them fast pattern-search queries. Our
new index complements the E2FM-index, which was introduced to compress and
encrypt collections of nucleotide sequences without relying on a reference
sequence. When used on collections of highly similar sequences, the ER-index
allows to obtain compression ratios which are an order of magnitude smaller
than those achieved with the E2FM-index, but maintaining its very good search
performance. Moreover, thanks to the ER-index multi-user and multiple-keys
encryption model, a single index can store the sequences related to a
population of individuals so that users may perform search operations only on
the sequences to which they were granted access. The ER-index C++ source code
plus scripts and data to assess the tool performance are available at:

integer $k$, delete a minimum-weight set of edges so that the remaining graph
has at least $k$ connected components. This problem is a natural generalization
of the global minimum cut problem, where the goal is to break the graph into
$k=2$ pieces.
</p>
<p>Our main result is a (combinatorial) $k$-cut algorithm on simple graphs that
runs in $n^{(1+o(1))k}$ time for any constant $k$, improving upon the
previously best $n^{(2\omega/3+o(1))k}$ time algorithm of Gupta et
al.~[FOCS'18] and the previously best $n^{(1.981+o(1))k}$ time combinatorial
algorithm of Gupta et al.~[STOC'19]. For combinatorial algorithms, this
algorithm is optimal up to $o(1)$ factors assuming recent hardness conjectures:
we show by a straightforward reduction that $k$-cut on even a simple graph is
as hard as $(k-1)$-clique, establishing a lower bound of $n^{(1-o(1))k}$ for
$k$-cut. This settles, up to lower-order factors, the complexity of $k$-cut on
a simple graph for combinatorial algorithms.

computational hydrodynamical methods, such as the Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics (SPH), often becomes a main bottleneck for scaling their
performance beyond a few million fluid elements per computing node. Tree
structures are particularly suitable for SPH simulation codes, which rely on
finding the exact close neighbors of each fluid element (or SPH particle). In
this work we present a novel tree structure, named \textit{$b$-tree}, which
features an adaptive branching factor to reduce the depth of the neighbor
search. Depending on the particle spatial distribution, finding neighbors using
\tree has an asymptotic best case complexity of $O(n)$, as opposed to $O(n \log
n)$ for other classical tree structures such as octrees and quadtrees. We also
present the proposed tree structure as well as the algorithms to build it and
to find the exact close neighbors of all particles. We assess the scalability
of the proposed tree-based algorithms through an extensive set of performance
experiments in a shared-memory system. Results show that b-tree is up to
$12\times$ faster for building the tree and up to $1.6\times$ faster for
finding the exact neighbors of all particles when compared to its octree form.
Moreover, we apply b-tree to a SPH code and show its usefulness over the
existing octree implementation, where b-tree is up to $5\times$ faster for
finding the exact close neighbors compared to the legacy code.

databases, networking, and search. Given a set S and a query q, the task is to
determine whether q in S. The Bloom Filter (BF) is a popular data structure for
approximate membership testing due to its simplicity. In particular, a BF
consists of a bit array that can be incrementally updated. A related problem
concerning this paper is the Multiple Set Membership Testing (MSMT) problem.
Here we are given K different sets, and for any given query q the goal is the
find all of the sets containing the query element. Trivially, a multiple set
membership instance can be reduced to K membership testing instances, each with
the same q, leading to O(K) query time. A simple array of Bloom Filters can
achieve that. In this paper, we show the first non-trivial data-structure for
streaming keys, RAMBO (Repeated And Merged Bloom Filter) that achieves expected
O(sqrt(K) logK) query time with an additional worst case memory cost factor of
O(logK) than the array of Bloom Filters. The proposed data-structure is simply
a count-min sketch arrangement of Bloom Filters and retains all its favorable
properties. We replace the addition operation with a set union and the minimum
operation with a set intersection during estimation.

<p><b>Authors: </b>Alexis Montoison, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/o/Orban:Dominique.html">Dominique Orban</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02598">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>We introduce an iterative method named BiLQ for solving general square linear
systems Ax = b based on the Lanczos biorthogonalization process defined by
least-norm subproblems, and that is a natural companion to BiCG and QMR.
Whereas the BiCG (Fletcher, 1976), CGS (Sonneveld, 1989) and BiCGSTAB (van der
Vorst, 1992) iterates may not exist when the tridiagonal projection of A is
singular, BiLQ is reliable on compatible systems even if A is ill-conditioned
or rank deficient. As in the symmetric case, the BiCG residual is often smaller
than the BiLQ residual and, when the BiCG iterate exists, an inexpensive
transfer from the BiLQ iterate is possible. Although the Euclidean norm of the
BiLQ error is usually not monotonic, it is monotonic in a different norm that
depends on the Lanczos vectors. We establish a similar property for the QMR
(Freund and Nachtigal, 1991) residual. BiLQ combines with QMR to take advantage
of two initial vectors and solve a system and an adjoint system simultaneously
at a cost similar to that of applying either method. We derive an analogous
combination of USYMLQ and USYMQR based on the orthogonal tridiagonalization
process (Saunders, Simon, and Yip, 1988). The resulting combinations, named
BiLQR and TriLQR, may be used to estimate integral functionals involving the
solution of a primal and an adjoint system. We compare BiLQR and TriLQR with
Minres-qlp on a related augmented system, which performs a comparable amount of
work and requires comparable storage. In our experiments, BiLQR terminates
earlier than TriLQR and MINRES-QLP in terms of residual and error of the primal
and adjoint systems.

applications in cryptography and hardness of approximation. An important open
problem is characterizing the power of no-signaling proofs. It is known that
2-prover no-signaling proofs are characterized by PSPACE, and that no-signaling
proofs with $poly(n)$-provers are characterized by EXP. However, the power of
$k$-prover no-signaling proofs, for $2&lt;k&lt;poly(n)$ remained an open problem.
</p>
<p>We show that $k$-prover no-signaling proofs (with negligible soundness) for
$k=O(\sqrt{\log n})$ are contained in PSPACE. We prove this via two different
routes that are of independent interest. In both routes we consider a
relaxation of no-signaling called sub-no-signaling. Our main technical
contribution (which is used in both our proofs) is a reduction showing how to
convert any sub-no-signaling strategy with value at least $1-2^{-\Omega(k^2)}$
into a no-signaling one with value at least $2^{-O(k^2)}$.
</p>
<p>In the first route, we show that the classical prover reduction method for
converting $k$-prover games into $2$-prover games carries over to the
no-signaling setting with the following loss in soundness: if a $k$-player game
has value less than $2^{-ck^2}$ (for some constant~$c&gt;0$), then the
corresponding 2-prover game has value at most $1 - 2^{dk^2}$ (for some
constant~$d&gt;0$). In the second route we show that the value of a
sub-no-signaling game can be approximated in space that is polynomial in the
communication complexity and exponential in the number of provers.

set $V$ into $k$ non-empty parts such that the subgraph induced by each part is
connected, and the partition is maximally balanced in the way that the maximum
cardinality of these $k$ parts is minimized. We refer this problem to as {\em
min-max balanced connected graph partition} into $k$ parts and denote it as
{\sc $k$-BGP}. The general vertex-weighted version of this problem on trees has
been studied since about four decades ago, which admits a linear time exact
algorithm; the vertex-weighted {\sc $2$-BGP} and {\sc $3$-BGP} admit a
$5/4$-approximation and a $3/2$-approximation, respectively; but no
approximability result exists for {\sc $k$-BGP} when $k \ge 4$, except a
trivial $k$-approximation. In this paper, we present another
$3/2$-approximation for our cardinality {\sc $3$-BGP} and then extend it to
become a $k/2$-approximation for {\sc $k$-BGP}, for any constant $k \ge 3$.
Furthermore, for {\sc $4$-BGP}, we propose an improved $24/13$-approximation.
To these purposes, we have designed several local improvement operations, which
could be useful for related graph partition problems.

is friendly (positive edge) or antagonistic (negative edge). The model is
simple but powerful and it can capture novel and interesting structural
properties of real-world phenomena. The analysis of signed networks has many
applications from modeling discussions in social media, to mining user reviews,
and to recommending products in e-commerce sites. In this paper we consider the
problem of discovering polarized communities in signed networks. In particular,
we search for two communities (subsets of the network vertices) where within
communities there are mostly positive edges while across communities there are
mostly negative edges. We formulate this novel problem as a "discrete
eigenvector" problem, which we show to be NP-hard. We then develop two
intuitive spectral algorithms: one deterministic, and one randomized with
quality guarantee $\sqrt{n}$ (where $n$ is the number of vertices in the
graph), tight up to constant factors. We validate our algorithms against
non-trivial baselines on real-world signed networks. Our experiments confirm
that our algorithms produce higher quality solutions, are much faster and can
scale to much larger networks than the baselines, and are able to detect
ground-truth polarized communities.

for Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. In QA
hardware, each decision variable of a QUBO should be mapped to one or more
adjacent qubits in such a way that pairs of variables defining a quadratic term
in the objective function are mapped to some pair of adjacent qubits. However,
qubits have limited connectivity in existing QA hardware. This has spurred work
on preprocessing algorithms for embedding the graph representing problem
variables with quadratic terms in the hardware graph representing qubits
adjacencies, such as the Chimera graph in hardware produced by D-Wave
Systems.In this paper, we use integer linear programming to search for an
embedding of the problem graph into certain classes of minors of the Chimera
graph, which we call template embeddings. One of these classes corresponds to
complete bipartite graphs, for which we show the limitation of the existing
approach based on minimum Odd Cycle Transversals (OCTs). Some of the
formulations presented are exact, and thus can be used to certify the absence
of a minor embedding. On an extensive test set consisting of random graphs from
five different classes of varying size and sparsity, we can embed 38% more
graphs than a state-of-the-art OCT-based approach.

lower bound, no such a clear measure exists for the compressibility of
repetitive sequences other than the uncomputable Kolmogorov's complexity. Since
statistical entropy does not capture repetitiveness, ad-hoc measures like the
size $z$ of the Lempel-Ziv parse are frequently used to estimate it. Recently,
a more principled measure, the size $\gamma$ of the smallest {\em attractor} of
a string $S[1..n]$, was introduced. Measure $\gamma$ lower bounds all the
previous relevant ones (e.g., $z$), yet $S$ can be represented and indexed
within space $O(\gamma\log(n/\gamma))$, which also upper bounds most measures.
While $\gamma$ is certainly a better measure of repetitiveness, it is
NP-complete to compute, and it is not known if $S$ can always be represented in
$O(\gamma)$ space.
</p>
<p>In this paper we study a smaller measure, $\delta \le \gamma$, which can be
computed in linear time. We show that $\delta$ captures better the concept of
compressibility in repetitive strings: We prove that, for some string families,
it holds $\gamma = \Omega(\delta \log n)$. Still, we can build a representation
of $S$ of size $O(\delta\log(n/\delta))$, which supports direct access to any
$S[i]$ in time $O(\log(n/\delta))$ and finds the $occ$ occurrences of any
pattern $P[1..m]$ in time $O(m\log n + occ\log^\epsilon n)$ for any constant
$\epsilon&gt;0$. Further, such representation is worst-case optimal because, in
some families, $S$ can only be represented in $\Omega(\delta\log n)$ space. We
complete our characterization of $\delta$ by showing that $\gamma$, $z$ and
other measures of repetitiveness are always $O(\delta\log(n/\delta))$, but in
some string families, the smallest context-free grammar is of size
$g=\Omega(\delta \log^2 n / \log\log n)$. No such a lower bound is known to
hold for $\gamma$.

two notions of time complexity: the total computation time without parallelism

$O(\rho^{3\omega/2}n^{\omega/2})$ time with high probability, where $\rho$ is

holds for any subgraph of $G$, as long as a geometric representation is at

matrix via Gaussian elimination, with the fact that geometric intersection
graphs have small separators. We also show that in many interesting cases, the
maximum matching problem in a general geometric intersection graph can be
reduced to the case of bounded density. In particular, a maximum matching in
the intersection graph of any family of translates of a convex object in the

algorithms given the development of the GraphBLAS library and other sparse
matrix methods. An exemplar for these approaches is Breadth-First Search (BFS).
The algebraic BFS algorithm is simply a recursion of matrix-vector
multiplications with the $n \times n$ adjacency matrix, but the many redundant
operations over nonzeros ultimately lead to suboptimal performance. Therefore
an optimal algebraic BFS should be of keen interest especially if it is easily
integrated with existing matrix methods.
</p>
<p>Current methods, notably in the GraphBLAS, use a Sparse Matrix Sparse Vector
(SpMSpV) multiplication in which the input vector is kept in a sparse
representation in each step of the BFS. But simply applying SpMSpV in BFS does
not lead to optimal runtime. Each nonzero in the vector must be masked in
subsequent steps. This has been an area of recent research in GraphBLAS and
other libraries. While in theory these masking methods are asymptotically
optimal on sparse graphs, many add work that leads to suboptimal runtime. We
give a new optimal, algebraic BFS for sparse graphs that is also a constant
factor faster than theoretically optimal SpMSpV methods, closing a gap in the
literature.
</p>
<p>Our method multiplies progressively smaller submatrices of the adjacency
matrix at each step, taking $O(m)$ algebraic operations on a sparse graph of
$O(m)$ edges as opposed to $O(mn)$ operations of other sparse matrix
approaches. Thus for sparse graphs it matches the bounds of the best-known
sequential algorithm and on a Parallel Random Access Machine (PRAM) it is
work-optimal. Compared to a leading GraphBLAS library our method achieves up to
24x faster sequential time and for parallel computation it can be 17x faster on
large graphs and 12x faster on large-diameter graphs.

<div class="content">
<p>In <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2018/03/16/drawing-clustered-graphs.html">a paper from last year</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustered_planarity">clustered planarity</a>, with Giordano Da Lozzo, Mike Goodrich, and Sid Gupta, we provided subexponential-time algorithms for arbitrary instances, and fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for instances whose embedded width and number of clusters are both bounded.</p>

<p>Now, in my newest preprint, “C-planarity testing of embedded clustered graphs with bounded dual carving-width” (with the same authors, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02057">arXiv:1910.02057</a>), we’ve eliminated the dependence on the number of clusters (using a different width parameter) and found a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm with just a single parameter.</p>

<p>It was just in time: while our paper was in submission, last July, Rado Fulek and Csaba Tóth put up their own preprint, “Atomic embeddability, clustered planarity, and thickenability” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13086">arXiv:1907.13086</a>) announcing a solution to the clustered planarity problem in polynomial time without dependence on parameters. I <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/102537368093048271">posted about it briefly at the time</a>, and can’t find much else more recent about it, but I assume it’s in submission to somewhere good. So our results may be only of historic value…</p>

<p>Our paper was presented at IPEC 2019 (part of the <a href="http://algo2019.ak.in.tum.de/">ALGO 2019 conference in Munich</a>) last month, and won IPEC best paper award. The late timing of the preprint is because (somewhat unusually for a CS conference) IPEC makes their proceedings versions due after the conference rather than before, so they can take into account feedback from the conference.
The arXiv version is more complete than the proceedings version will be, because of page limits in the proceedings, but we prepared it at the same time.</p>

<h3><a class="entryheader" href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/10/what-comes-first-theory-or-practice-its.html">What comes first theory or practice? Its Complicated!</a></h3>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
Having majored in pure math I had the impression that usually the theory comes first and then someone works out something to work in practice. While this is true sometimes it is often NOT true and this will not surprise any of my blog readers.  Even so, I want to tell you about some times it surprised me. This says more about my ignorance than about math or applications or whatnot.<br />
<br />
1) Quantum<br />
<br />
a) Factoring was proven to be in BQP way before actual quantum computers could do this in reasonable time (we're still waiting).<br />
<br />
b) Quantum Crypto- This really is out there. I do not know what came first, the theory or the practice. Or if they were in tandem.<br />
<br />
c) (this one is the inspiration for the post)  When I first heard the term <i>Quantum Supremacy</i> I thought it meant the desire for a THEOREM that problem A is in BQP but is provably not in P.  For example, if someone proved factoring is not in P (unlikely this will be proven, and hey- maybe  factoring is in P). Perhaps some contrived problem like those constructed by diagonalization (my spell checker thinks that's not a word. Having worked in computability theory, I think it is. Darn- my spellchecker thinks computability is not word.) Hence when I heard that Google had a paper proving Quantum Supremacy (I do not recall if I actually heard the word  <i>proven) </i>I assumed that there was some <i>theoretical </i>breakthrough. I was surprised and not in the slightest disappointed to find out it involved actual quantum computers.<br />
<br />
<b>Question</b>: When the term <i>Quantum Supremacy</i> was first coined, did they mean theoretical, or IRL, or both?<br />
<br />
2) Ramsey Theory<br />
<br />
a) For Ramsey's Theorem and Van Der waerden's theorem and Rado's theorem and others I could name, first a theorem showed a upper bound on a number, then later computers and perhaps some math got better bounds on that number.<br />
<br />
b) Consider the following statement:<br />
<br />
For all c there exists P such that for all c-colorings of {1,...,P} there exists x,y,z the same color such that x<sup>2</sup> +y<sup>2</sup> = z<sup>2</sup>.<br />
<br />
Ronald Graham conjectured the c=2 case and offered $100 in the 1980's. (I do not know if he had any comment on the general case.)  I assumed that it would be proven with ginormous bounds on the P(c) function, and then perhaps some reasonable bound would be found by clever programming and some math. (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_Pythagorean_triples_problem">here</a> for the Wikipedia Entry about the problem, which also has pointers to other material).<br />
<br />
Instead the c=2 case was proven with an exact bound, P(2)=7825, by a computer program, in 2016. The proof is 200 terabytes. So my prediction was incorrect.<br />
<br />
As for the result<br />
<br />
PRO: We know the result is true for c=2 and we even know the exact bound. Wow! and for Ramsey Theory its unusual to have exact bounds!<br />
<br />
CON: It would be good to have a human-readable proof. This is NOT an anti-technology statement. For one thing, a human-readable proof might help us get the result for c=3 and beyond.<br />
<br />
3) This item is a cheat in that I knew the empirical results first. However, I will tell you what I am sure I would have thought (and been wrong) had I not know them.<br />
<br />
Given k, does the equation<br />
<br />
<br />
x<sup>3</sup> +y<sup>3</sup> +z<sup>3</sup> = k<br />
<br />
have a solution in Z? I would have thought that some hard number theory would determine<br />
for which k it has a solution (with a proof that does not give the actual solutions)  and for then a computer programs would try to find the solutions. Instead (1) some values of k are ruled out by simple mod considerations, and (2) as for the rest, computers have found solutions for some of them. Lipton-Regan (<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/09/30/writing-33-as-a-sum-of-cubes/">here</a>) and Gasarch (<a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/04/x-3-y-3-z-3-33-has-solution-in-z-and.html">here</a>) have blogged about the k=33 case. Lipton-Regan also comment on the more recent k=42 case.<br />

<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from 
<a class="entryheader" href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog" title="Shtetl-Optimized">Scott Aaronson</a>
<p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>A couple weeks ago I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rationalists-Artificial-Intelligence-Geeks-World/dp/1474608779/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">The AI Does Not Hate You: Superintelligence, Rationality, and the Race to Save the World</a>, the first-ever book-length examination of the modern <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationalist_movement">rationalist community</a>, by British journalist <a href="https://twitter.com/TomChivers?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Tom Chivers</a>.  I was planning to review it here, before it got preempted by the news of <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4317">quantum supremacy</a> (and subsequent news of <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4342">classical non-supremacy</a>).  Now I can get back to rationalists.</p>



<p>Briefly, I think the book is a triumph.  It’s based around in-person conversations with many of the notable figures in and around the rationalist community, in its Bay Area epicenter and beyond (although apparently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a> only agreed to answer technical questions by Skype), together of course with the voluminous material available online.  There’s a good deal about the 1990s origins of the community that I hadn’t previously known.</p>



<p>The title is taken from Eliezer’s aphorism, “The AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made of atoms which it can use for something else.”  In other words: as soon as anyone succeeds in building a superhuman AI, if we don’t take extreme care that the AI’s values are “aligned” with human ones, the AI might be expected to obliterate humans almost instantly as a byproduct of pursuing whatever it <em>does</em> value, more-or-less as we humans did with woolly mammoths, moas, and now gorillas, rhinos, and thousands of other species.</p>



<p>Much of the book relates Chivers’s personal quest to figure out how seriously he should take this scenario.  Are the rationalists just an unusually nerdy doomsday cult?  Is there some non-negligible chance that they’re actually right about the AI thing?  If so, how much more time do we have—and is there even anything meaningful that can be done today?  Do the dramatic advances in machine learning over the past decade change the outlook?  Should Chivers be worried about his own two children?  How does this risk compare to the more “prosaic” civilizational risks, like climate change or nuclear war?  I suspect that Chivers’s exploration will be most interesting to readers who, like me, regard the answers to <em>none</em> of these questions as obvious.</p>



<p>While it sounds extremely basic, what makes <em>The AI Does Not Hate You</em> so valuable to my mind is that, as far as I know, it’s nearly the only examination of the rationalists ever written by an outsider that tries to assess the ideas on a scale from true to false, rather than from quirky to offensive.  Chivers’s own training in academic philosophy seems to have been crucial here.  He’s not put off by people who act weirdly around him, even needlessly cold or aloof, nor by utilitarian thought experiments involving death or torture or weighing the value of human lives.  He just cares, relentlessly, about the ideas—and about remaining a basically grounded and decent person while engaging them.  Most strikingly, Chivers clearly feels a need—anachronistic though it seems in 2019—actually to <em>understand</em> complicated arguments, be able to repeat them back correctly, before he attacks them.</p>



<p>Indeed, far from failing to understand the rationalists, it occurs to me that the central criticism of Chivers’s book is likely to be just the opposite: he understands the rationalists so well, extends them so much sympathy, and ends up endorsing so many aspects of their worldview, that he must simply <em>be</em> a closet rationalist himself, and therefore can’t write about them with any pretense of journalistic or anthropological detachment.  For my part, I’d say: it’s true that <em>The AI Does Not Hate You</em> is what you get if you treat rationalists as extremely smart (if unusual) people from whom you might learn something of consequence, rather than as monkeys in a zoo.  On the other hand, Chivers does perform the journalist’s task of constantly challenging the rationalists he meets, often with points that (if upheld) would be fatal to their worldview.  One of the rationalists’ best features—and this precisely matches my own experience—is that, far from clamming up or storming off when faced with such challenges (“lo! the visitor is not one of us!”), the rationalists positively relish them.</p>



<p>It occurred to me the other day that we’ll never know how the rationalists’ ideas would’ve developed, had they continued to do so in a cultural background like that of the late 20th century.  As Chivers points out, the rationalists today are effectively caught in the crossfire of a much larger cultural war—between, to their right, the recrudescent know-nothing authoritarians, and to their left, what one could variously describe as woke culture, call-out culture, or sneer culture.  On its face, it might seem laughable to conflate the rationalists with today’s resurgent fascists: many rationalists are driven by their utilitarianism to advocate open borders and massive aid to the Third World; the rationalist community is about as welcoming of alternative genders and sexualities as it’s humanly possible to be; and leading rationalists like Scott Alexander and Eliezer Yudkowsky strongly condemned Trump for the obvious reasons. </p>



<p>Chivers, however, explains how the problem started.  On rationalist Internet forums, many misogynists and white nationalists and so forth encountered nerds willing to <em>debate their ideas politely</em>, rather than immediately banning them as more mainstream venues would.  As a result, many of those forces of darkness (and they probably don’t mind being called that) predictably congregated on the rationalist forums, and their stench predictably wore off on the rationalists themselves.  Furthermore, this isn’t an easy-to-fix problem, because debating ideas on their merits, extending charity to ideological opponents, etc. is sort of the rationalists’ <em>entire shtick</em>, whereas denouncing and no-platforming anyone who can be connected to an ideological enemy (in the modern parlance, “punching Nazis”) is the entire shtick of those condemning the rationalists.</p>



<p>Compounding the problem is that, as anyone who’s ever hung out with STEM nerds might’ve guessed, the rationalist community tends to skew WASP, Asian, or Jewish, non-impoverished, and male.  Worse yet, while many rationalists live their lives in progressive enclaves and strongly support progressive values, they’ll also undergo extreme anguish if they feel forced to subordinate truth to those values.</p>



<p>Chivers writes that all of these issues “blew up in spectacular style at the end of 2014,” right here on this blog.  Oh, what the hell, I’ll just quote him:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Scott Aaronson is, I think it’s fair to say, a member of the Rationalist community.  He’s a prominent theoretical computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, and writes a very interesting, maths-heavy blog called Shtetl-Optimised.</p><p>People in the comments under his blog were discussing feminism and sexual harassment.  And Aaronson, in a comment in which he described himself as a fan of Andrea Dworkin, described having been terrified of speaking to women as a teenager and young man.  This fear was, he said, partly that of being thought of as a sexual abuser or creep if any woman ever became aware that he sexually desired them, a fear that he picked up from sexual-harassment-prevention workshops at his university and from reading feminist literature.  This fear became so overwhelming, he said in the comment that came to be known as Comment #171, that he had ‘constant suicidal thoughts’ and at one point ‘actually begged a psychiatrist to prescribe drugs that would chemically castrate me (I had researched which ones), because a life of mathematical asceticism was the only future that I could imagine for myself.’  So when he read feminist articles talking about the ‘male privilege’ of nerds like him, he didn’t recognise the description, and so felt himself able to declare himself ‘only’ 97 per cent on board with the programme of feminism.</p><p>It struck me as a thoughtful and rather sweet remark, in the midst of a long and courteous discussion with a female commenter.  But it got picked up, weirdly, by some feminist bloggers, including one who described it as ‘a yalp of entitlement combined with an aggressive unwillingness to accept that women are human beings just like men’ and that Aaronson was complaining that ‘having to explain my suffering to women when they should already be there, mopping my brow and offering me beers and blow jobs, is so tiresome.’</p><p>Scott Alexander (<em>not</em> Scott Aaronson) then wrote a furious 10,000-word defence of his friend… (p. 214-215)</p></blockquote>



<p>And then Chivers goes on to explain Scott Alexander’s central thesis, in <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/01/untitled/">Untitled</a>, that privilege is not a one-dimensional axis, so that (to take one example) society can make many women in STEM miserable while <em>also</em> making shy male nerds miserable in different ways.</p>



<p>For nerds, perhaps an alternative title for Chivers’s book could be “The Normal People Do Not Hate You (Not All of Them, Anyway).”  It’s as though Chivers is demonstrating, through understated example, that taking delight in nerds’ suffering, wanting them to be miserable and alone, mocking their weird ideas, is not simply the default, well-adjusted human reaction, with any other reaction being ‘creepy’ and ‘problematic.’  Some might even go so far as to apply the latter adjectives to the sneerers’ attitude, the one that dresses up schoolyard bullying in a social-justice wig.</p>



<p>Reading Chivers’s book prompted me to reflect on my own relationship to the rationalist community.  For years, I interacted often with the community—I’ve known Robin Hanson since ~2004 and Eliezer Yudkowsky since ~2006, and our blogs bounced off each other—but I never considered myself a member.  I never ranked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer">paperclip-maximizing AIs</a> among humanity’s more urgent threats—indeed, I saw them as a distraction from an all-too-likely climate catastrophe that will leave its survivors lucky to have stone tools, let alone AIs.  I was also repelled by what I saw as the rationalists’ cultier aspects.  I even once toyed with the idea of changing the name of this blog to “More Wrong” or “Wallowing in Bias,” as a play on the rationalists’ <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/">LessWrong</a> and <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/">OvercomingBias</a>.</p>



<p>But I’ve drawn much closer to the community over the last few years, because of a combination of factors:</p>



<ol><li>The comment-171 affair.  This was not the sort of thing that could provide any new information about the likelihood of a dangerous AI being built, but <em>was</em> (to put it mildly) the sort of thing that can tell you who your friends are.  I learned that empathy works a lot like intelligence, in that those who boast of it most loudly are often the ones who lack it.</li><li>The astounding progress in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">deep learning</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">GANs</a>, which caused me (like everyone else, perhaps) to update in the direction of human-level AI in our lifetimes being an actual live possibility,</li><li>The rise of <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">Scott Alexander</a>.  To the charge that the rationalists are a cult, there’s now the reply that Scott, with his constant equivocations and doubts, his deep dives into data, his clarity and self-deprecating humor, is perhaps the least culty cult leader in human history.  Likewise, to the charge that the rationalists are basement-dwelling kibitzers who accomplish nothing of note in the real world, there’s now the reply that Scott has attracted a huge mainstream following (Steven Pinker, Paul Graham, presidential candidate Andrew Yang…), purely by offering up what’s self-evidently some of the best writing of our time.</li><li>Research.  The AI-risk folks started publishing some research papers that I found interesting—some with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565">relatively approachable problems</a> that I could see myself trying to think about if quantum computing ever got boring.  This shift seems to have happened at roughly around the same time my former student, <a href="https://paulfchristiano.com/">Paul Christiano</a>, “defected” from quantum computing to AI-risk research. </li></ol>



<p>Anyway, if you’ve spent years steeped in the rationalist blogosphere, read Eliezer’s <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences">“Sequences,”</a> and so on, <em>The AI Does Not Hate You</em> will probably have little that’s new, although it might still be interesting to revisit ideas and episodes that you know through a newcomer’s eyes.  To anyone else … well, reading the book would be a lot faster than spending all those years reading blogs!  I’ve heard of some rationalists now giving out copies of the book to their relatives, by way of explaining how they’ve chosen to spend their lives.</p>



<p>I <em>still</em> don’t know whether there’s a risk worth worrying about that a misaligned AI will threaten human civilization in my lifetime, or my children’s lifetimes, or even 500 years—or whether everyone will look back and laugh at how silly some people once were to think that (except, silly in which way?).  But I do feel fairly confident that <em>The AI Does Not Hate You</em> will make a positive difference—possibly for the world, but at any rate for a little well-meaning community of sneered-at nerds obsessed with the future and with following ideas wherever they lead.</p></div>

The probabilistic degree of a Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ is defined to be the smallest $d$ such that there is a random polynomial $\mathbf{P}$ of degree at most $d$ that agrees with $f$ at each point with high probability. Introduced by Razborov (1987), upper and lower bounds on probabilistic degrees of Boolean functions --- specifically symmetric Boolean functions --- have been used to prove explicit lower bounds, design pseudorandom generators, and devise algorithms for combinatorial problems. 
		
In this paper, we characterize the probabilistic degrees of all symmetric Boolean functions up to polylogarithmic factors over all fields of fixed characteristic (positive or zero).</div>

A decision list is an ordered list of rules. Each rule is specified by a term, which is a conjunction of literals, and a value. Given an input, the output of a decision list is the value corresponding to the first rule whole term is satisfied by the input. Decision lists generalize both CNFs and DNFs, and have been studied both in complexity theory and in learning theory.

The size of a decision list is the number of rules, and its width is the maximal number of variables in a term. We prove that decision lists of small width can always be approximated by decision lists of small size, where we obtain sharp bounds (up to constants). This in particular resolves a conjecture of Gopalan, Meka and Reingold (Computational Complexity, 2013) on DNF sparsification.

An ingredient in our proof is a new random restriction lemma, which allows to analyze how DNFs (and more generally, decision lists) simplify if a small fraction of the variables are fixed. This is in contrast to the more commonly used switching lemma, which requires most of the variables to be fixed.</div>

<div class="content">
Buhrman, Cleve and Wigderson (STOC'98) observed that for every Boolean function $f : \{-1, 1\}^n \to \{-1, 1\}$ and $\bullet : \{-1, 1\}^2 \to \{-1, 1\}$ the two-party bounded-error quantum communication complexity of $(f \circ \bullet)$ is $O(Q(f) \log n)$, where $Q(f)$ is the bounded-error quantum query complexity of $f$. Note that the bounded-error randomized communication complexity of $(f \circ \bullet)$ is bounded by $O(R(f))$, where $R(f)$ denotes the bounded-error randomized query complexity of $f$. Thus, the BCW simulation has an extra $O(\log n)$ factor appearing that is absent in classical simulation. A natural question is if this factor can be avoided. H{\o}yer and de Wolf (STACS'02) showed that for the Set-Disjointness function, this can be reduced to $c^{\log^* n}$ for some constant $c$, and subsequently Aaronson and Ambainis (FOCS'03) showed that this factor can be made a constant. That is, the quantum communication complexity of the Set-Disjointness function (which is $NOR_n \circ \wedge$) is $O(Q(NOR_n))$.

Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, we show that when $ \bullet = \oplus$, then the extra $\log n$ factor in the BCW simulation is unavoidable. In other words, we exhibit a total function $F : \{-1, 1\}^n \to \{-1, 1\}$ such that $Q^{cc}(F \circ \oplus) = \Theta(Q(F) \log n)$.

To the best of our knowledge, it was not even known prior to this work whether there existed a total function $F$ and 2-bit function $\bullet$, such that $Q^{cc}(F \circ \bullet) = \omega(Q(F))$.</div>

<p>One of my favorite parables ever since childhood was that of the four blind men and the elephant, with each man announcing the local image evoked in his mind’s eye on touching a different part of the elephant. This parable has provided an interesting metaphor even for serious scientific matters, a well-known one being wave-particle duality in physics.</p>
<p>But when it comes to matching markets, the parable has taken an unusual twist, with the proverbial elephant undergoing a metamorphosis of its own! The “blind men’’ in this case are entire disciplines which can lay claim to the field of matching markets. Of course, the obvious one is economics – the founders of this field, namely Gale and Shapley, were mathematical economists and <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2012/summary/">the 2012 Nobel Prize in Economics</a> was awarded to Alvin Roth and Lloyd Shapley for work on these markets.</p>
<p>A key enabler was researchers in systems and networking. Their scientific revolutions of the Internet and mobile computing put matching markets on an exciting, new journey and their systems run these centralized markets on powerful computers.</p>
<p>The discipline of algorithm design has had an umbilical connection to matching markets: At the birth of this field lies the highly sophisticated <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4169/amer.math.monthly.120.05.386?journalCode=uamm20">Gale-Shapley</a> stable matching algorithm (1962), whose pivotal game-theoretic property of incentive compatibility follows as a free gift from polynomial time solvability — it was established <a href="http://pareto.uab.es/jmasso/pdf/DubinsFreedmanAMM1981.pdf">two decades</a> after the discovery of the algorithm! Yet most researchers, including those in theoretical computer science, are not aware that algorithm design is also a legitimate claimant to this field. Indeed, the very “engine’’ that runs almost each one of these markets is a <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/rmklectures2019-fall-1">sophisticated algorithm</a> chosen from the “gold mine’’ of matching theory! Besides stable matching, this includes maximum matching and online matching and their numerous variants.</p>
<p>Looking back at the huge expansion of matching markets over the last decade-and-a-half, one can see that all three disciplines were faced with numerous challenges: understanding the incentive structure of a new market; finding ways of dealing with terra-bytes of data, and choosing and delivering within milli-seconds the “right’’ ads to show with a user query; and designing an algorithm for the latest variant of online matching. And they all delivered!</p>
<p>The rich and diverse set of research talks given at the recent <a href="https://agtb.wordpress.com/2019/10/02/matching-markets-simons-driven-by-theory-driving-the-economy/">Simons program</a> on matching markets is proof enough that the elephant is still evolving!</p></div>

<p>I get a lot of questions about how I spent last summer. Normally I just take off to the Bay Area the day my last Spring class is over and fly back the day before my Fall class begins.
However, last summer I decided I’ve been in the US long enough to learn everything it has to offer and it was time to explore life across the pond and spend three months at the Alan Turing Institute in London. Then I had two interns coming over to Bloomington so I spent my first ever summer month here. 
Since it is that time of year, a quick reminder to <a href="https://cs.indiana.edu/apply/graduate-application.html">apply by Dec 15</a> if you are interested in doing a Ph.D. and stay tuned for the internship call announcement (probably similar deadline).</p>

<h1 id="summer-interns-in-bloomington">Summer Interns in Bloomington</h1>

<p>IU has started a <a href="https://sice.indiana.edu/research/student-research/fellowship.html">Global Talent Attraction Program (GTAP)</a> – fantastic program for international summer interns. The program gives you a $4000 stipend and you spend 2 months here at IU. There were a lot of strong applicants so it took me a while to interview all candidates. In the end, the two interns I got were <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/Chameleon2460">Jakub Boguta</a> (U. Warsaw, ACM ICPC gold this year, must be tough to be in the lead for 4 hours and not win) and <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/josdas">Stanislav Naumov</a> (SPb ITMO, ACM ICPC finalist, who spent summer at Google and just arrived on campus). Also, <a href="https://www.eleves.ens.fr/home/farthaud/">Farid Arthaud</a> joined us from ENS Paris, Ulm with a short recommendation of being “probably the best third-year CS student in France”. If you think you are the best in your country, have U.S. citizenship and don’t need to get paid, shoot me an email ;) Despite it being hot and humid here in Bloomington during the summer, we had a great time.</p>

<div align="center"><img width="400" alt="interns" src="http://grigory.github.io/blog/pics/interns.jpg" /></div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>We decided to dive into deep learning for image classification and figured out how to get more mileage out of standard pretrained neural nets by using them to produce hierarchical clusterings (with guarantees). If this sounds fun, you can apply for GTAP next year (picture by Farid).</p>

<h1 id="london-and-the-alan-turing-institute">London and the Alan Turing Institute</h1>

<p>Overall, this was a great experience as it quickly became clear that my neural net is overfit to the US lifestyle. I think of UK as throwing in some perturbations to your visual and verbal input (some may seem adversarial, but mostly just random) which, as we know, is good for robustness, generalization and what not.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Q</b>: Is grass greener there? <b>A</b>: Yes, of course. Especially, if you live next to the Regent’s Park.</li>
  <li><b>Q</b>: Is it your cup of tea? <b>A</b>: No, I still only function on Redbull, but the afternoon teas are a great experience. Proximity to cutting-edge tech, CS research and startups still matters most to me. However, if you are into math or finance, your mileage will almost certainly vary. Also, London seems perfect for a short-term visit/sabbatical, especially if you want to take a break from the tech hype, write a book, explore Europe, etc.</li>
  <li><b>Q</b>: What’s up with the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/">Alan Turing Institute</a> and DeepMind? <b>A</b>: These two are probably the most happening places in the UK right now in academia and industry respectively. They are within a 5-minute walk from each other in King’s Cross. I was staying right across the road and it was perfect except for no AC. ATI serves as a meeting hub for researchers from all of the top UK schools (Cambridge, Oxford, Warwick, UCL, Edinburgh, etc.).
ATI is based inside the British library, which was the largest public building constructed in the UK in the 20th century. ATI has its own space inside the library which is equipped similarly to Google/FB offices. Except no free food, only drinks – would you want to have free British food anyway?</li>

K and I took a 2-hour train down there directly from King’s Cross (St. Pancras station, another reason to stay in King’s Cross). We’ve enjoyed our time greatly, especially in Versailles and ENS Paris, Ulm. The Salvador Dali Museum in Montmartre was another highlight of this trip.</li>

<div class="content">
In [20] Goldwasser, Grossman and Holden  introduced pseudo-deterministic interactive proofs for search problems where a powerful prover can convince a probabilistic polynomial time verifier that a solution to a search problem is canonical.  They studied  search problems for which polynomial time algorithms are not known and for which many solutions are possible. They showed that whereas there exists a constant round pseudo deterministic proof for graph isomorphism where the canonical solution is the lexicographically smallest isomorphism, the existence of pseudo-deterministic interactive proofs for NP-hard problems would imply the collapse of the polynomial time hierarchy.

In this paper, we turn our attention to studying  doubly-efficient pseudo-deterministic proofs for polynomial time search problems:  pseudo-deterministic proofs with the extra requirement that the prover runtime is polynomial  and the verifier runtime to verify that a solution is canonical is significantly lower  than the complexity of finding any solution, canonical or otherwise. Naturally this question is particularly interesting for search problems for which a lower bound on its worst case complexity  is known or has been widely conjectured. 

We show doubly-efficient pseudo-deterministic algorithms for a host of natural problems whose complexity has long been conjectured. In particular:

We show a doubly efficient pseudo-deterministic proof for linear programming where the canonical solution which the prover will provide is  the lexicographically greatest optimal solution for the LP. To this end, we show how through perturbing the linear program and strong duality this solution can be both  computed efficiently by the prover, and verified by the verifier.  
The time of the verifier is $O(d^2 )$ for a linear program with integer data and at most $d$ variables and constraints, whereas the time to solve such linear program is $\tilde{O}(d^{\omega} )$ by randomized algorithms [11] for $\omega$  the exponent for fast matrix multiplication .


We show a doubly efficient pseudo-deterministic proof for 3-SUM and problems reducible to 3-SUM where the prover is a $O(n^2)$ time algorithm and the verifier takes time $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$. 


We show a doubly-efficient pseudo-deterministic proof for the hitting set problem} where the verifier runs in time $\tilde{O}(m)$ and the prover runs in time $\tilde{O}(m^2)$ where $ m = \sum_{S \in \mathcal{S}} |S| + \sum_{T \in \mathcal{T}} |T|$ for inputs  collections of sets $\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{T}$.

We show a doubly-efficient pseudo-deterministic proof for the Zero Weight Triangle problem where the verifier runs in time $\tilde{O}(n^{2 + \omega/3})$ and the prover runs in randomized time $\tilde{O}(n^3)$. The Zero Weight Triangle problem is equivalent to the All-Pairs Shortest Path problem, a well-studied problem that is the foundation of many hardness results in graph algorithms [39,38], under sub-cubic reductions.</div>

We study the problem of finding monotone subsequences in an array from the viewpoint of sublinear algorithms. For fixed $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we show that the non-adaptive query complexity of finding a length-$k$ monotone subsequence of $f \colon [n] \to \mathbb{R}$, assuming that $f$ is $\varepsilon$-far from free of such subsequences, is $\Theta((\log n)^{\lfloor \log_2 k \rfloor})$. Prior to our work, the best algorithm for this problem, due to Newman, Rabinovich, Rajendraprasad, and Sohler (2017), made $(\log n)^{O(k^2)}$ non-adaptive queries; and the only lower bound known, of $\Omega(\log n)$ queries for the case $k = 2$, followed from that on testing monotonicity due to Erg\"un, Kannan, Kumar, Rubinfeld, and Viswanathan (2000) and Fischer (2004).</div>

<p><s>Five</s> Six papers this month: results on testing separations, linearity testing in \(\mathbb{R}^n\), testing for regular languages, graph property testing, topological property testing, and Boolean rank. </p>



<p><strong>Hard properties with (very) short PCPPs and their applications</strong>, by Omri Ben-Eliezer, Eldar Fischer, Amit Levi, and Ron D. Rothblum (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/088/">arXiv</a>). Probably, the most significant takeaway from this work is a (largest possible) separation between standard and tolerant property testing. PCPPs (Probabilistically Checkable Proofs of Proximity) are the “NP” variant of property testing, where the tester is aided by a proof string. Consider property \(\mathcal{P}\). If \(x \in \mathcal{P}\), there must be a proof string that makes the tester accept (with probability 1). If \(x\) is far from \(\mathcal{P}\) (in the usual property testing sense), for any proof string, the tester must reject with sufficiently high probability. PCPPs have played a role in the classical constructions of PCPs, but have also found uses in getting a better understanding of property testing itself. And this paper shows how PCPP constructions can be used to get property testing separations. The main result in this paper is a property \(\mathcal{P}\) that (basically) requires \(\Omega(n)\) queries to “property test”, but has a PCPP system where the proof length is \(\widetilde{O}(n)\). (\(n\) is the input length.) The main construction uses collections of random linear codes. Significantly, these constructions show a strong separation between standard vs tolerant property testing, and standard vs erasure-resilient property testing. (The latter is a recent variant by <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/16M1075661?journalCode=smjcat">Dixit et al</a>, where certain parts of the input are hidden from the tester.) There is a property that is testable in a constant number of queries, but requires \(\widetilde{\Omega}(n)\) queries to test tolerantly (for any non-trivial choice of parameters). An analogous result holds for erasure-resilient testing.</p>



<p><strong>Distribution-Free Testing of Linear Functions on R^n</strong>, by Noah Fleming and Yuichi Yoshida (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03391">arXiv</a>). Linearity testing is arguably <em>the</em> canonical problem in property testing, yet there is still much to be learned about it. This paper considers functions \(f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\), and the <em>distribution-free setting</em>. (In this setting, distance is measured according is an unknown distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) over the input, and the tester can access samples from this distribution. For \(\mathbb{R}^n\), the “standard” distribution would the \(n\)-dimensional Gaussian.) The main result is that linearity testing can be done in the distribution-free setting with \(\widetilde{O}(1/\varepsilon)\) queries, assuming that the distribution is continuous. The primary technical tool, an interesting result in its own right, is that additivity \((f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y))\) can be tested in \(\widetilde{O}(1/\varepsilon)\) queries. The significance of the testing result is cemented by an \(\Omega(n)\) lower bound for sample-based testers.</p>



<p><strong>Sliding window property testing for regular languages</strong> by Moses Ganardi, Danny Hucke, Markus Lohrey, Tatiana Starikovskaya (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10261">arXiv</a>). Fix a regular language \(\mathcal{R}\). Consider the streaming model, and the basic question of recognizing whether the string (being streamed) is in \(\mathcal{R}\). Simple, you will say! Run the DFA recognizing \(\mathcal{R}\) in constant space. Now, suppose there is a sliding window length of \(n\). The aim is to determine if the past \(n\) symbols (the “active window”) form a string in \(\mathcal{R}\). Suprisingly (at least to me), there is a full characterization of the space required for randomized algorithms, and (depending on \(\mathcal{R}\)), it is either \(\Theta(1)\), \(\Theta(\log\log n)\), \(\Theta(\log n)\), or \(\Theta(n)\).  In the interest of beating these lower bounds, suppose we wish to property test on the active window. It turns out the answer is quite nuanced. There are deterministic \(O(\log n)\)-space testers and randomized two-sided \(O(1/\varepsilon)\)-space testers for all regular languages. For randomized one-sided testers, there are multiple possibilities for the optimal space complexity, and there is a full characterization of these regular languages.</p>



<p><strong>A characterization of graph properties testable for general planar graphs with one-sided error (It’s all about forbidden subgraphs)</strong> by Artur Czumaj and Christian Sohler (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.10647.pdf">arXiv</a>). Property testing of sparse graphs has been receiving more attention, but most results focus on the bounded degree setting. Unfortunately, many of these results break quite dramatically on sparse graphs with unbounded degrees. This paper focuses on property testing, within the class of unbounded degree planar graphs. (Meaning, the input is always assumed to be planar.) The results achieve a significant goal: as the title suggests, there is a complete characterization of properties that are constant-query testable with one-sided error. The easier part is in showing that all such properties can be reduced to testing \(H\)-freeness. The harder (remarkable) result is \(H\)-freeness can be tested in general planar queries with constant queries. (This is non-trivial even for triangle-freeness.) And, as is easy to conjecture but hard to prove, these results carry over for all minor-closed families.  As a small indication of the challenge, most testers for bounded-degree graphs work by doing constant depth BFSes. When high degree vertices are present, this method fails, and we really need new ideas to deal with such graphs.</p>



<p><strong>Near Coverings and Cosystolic Expansion – an example of topological property testing</strong> by Irit Dinur and Roy Meshulam (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/126/">ECCC</a>). In most algebraic settings, property testing results can be seen as local to global theorems. When do local constraints on a large object imply a global condition? This paper gives a topological instantiation of this phenomenon. We need to define the <em>cover</em> of a simplicial complex \(X\). For concreteness, think of a 2D simplicial complex \(X\), which is a hypergraph with hyperedges of size at most 3, where subsets of hyperedges are also present. A 2-cover is a simplicial complex \(X’\) with the following property. It has two copies of each vertex of \(X\). Each hyperedge of \(X\) must have two “corresponding” disjoint copies in \(X’\). Let the copies of vertex \(v\) be \(v_0, v_1\). Then, for every hyperedge (say) \((u,v,w)\) of \(X\), there must be two disjoint hyperedges in \(X’\) involving copies of the corresponding vertices. One can consider the property testing twist: if the neighborhoods of “most” vertices \(v\) in \(X\) satisfy these condition (with respect to the neighborhoods of the copies of \(v\) in \(X’\)), then is \(X’\) close to being a cover of \(X\)? Indeed, this paper proves that such a “property testing condition” holds iff \(X\) is a high-dimensional expander.</p>



<p><strong>Property testing of the Boolean and binary rank</strong> by Michal Parnas, Dana Ron, and Adi Shraibman (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11632">arXiv</a>). The Boolean rank of a matrix \(M\) is a fundamental quantity that appears in many lower bound constructions. (Recall that an \(n \times m\) Boolean matrix \(M\) has a rank \(r\) if \(M\) can be expressed as \(X \cdot Y\), where \(X \in \mathbb{F}_2^{n \times d}\) and \(Y \in \mathbb{F}_2^{d \times m}\).) In the real-valued setting, results show that one can property test rank in \(poly(d/\varepsilon)\) queries. This paper proves an analogous result for the Boolean rank. There is a surprise element here: over reals, the rank can be computed in polynomial time, and many of the geometric intuitions can be brought over to the property testing problem. On the other hand, the Boolean rank is NP-hard to compute exactly, yet we can still get a tester with \(poly(d)\) query complexity. The paper also gives results for <em>binary rank</em>. For the binary rank, we require the component matrices \(X, Y\) to be Boolean, but algebraic operations are over the reals. In the case, the tester has query complexity \(2^{2d}\) (with varying dependencies on \(\varepsilon\) for adaptive/non-adaptive testers). The intriguing open problem is whether \(poly(d)\)-query testers exist for binary rank.</p>
