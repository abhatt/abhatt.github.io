<p>As life is tentatively returning to normal, I would like to once again post technical material here. Before returning to online optimization, I would like to start with something from 2015 that we never wrote up properly, that has to do with <em>graph curvature</em> and with <em>Buser inequalities in graphs</em>.</p>

It is important in the spectral theory of graphs that this eigenvalue has a variational characterization as the solution of the following optimization problem:</p>

<p> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bcut%28S%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{cut(S)}" class="latex" /> denotes the number of edges with one endpoint in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" /> and one endpoint outside <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" />. We have talked about these quantities several times, so we will just jump to the fact that the following <em>Cheeger inequalities</em> hold:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac+%7B%5Clambda_2+%7D2+%5Cleq+%5Cphi%28G%29+%5Cleq+%5Csqrt+%7B2+%5Clambda_2%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \frac {\lambda_2 }2 \leq \phi(G) \leq \sqrt {2 \lambda_2} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Those inequalities are called Cheeger inequality because the upper bound is the discrete analog of a result of Cheeger concerning Riemann manifolds. There were previous posts about this <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2013/03/20/the-cheeger-inequality-in-manifolds/">here</a> and <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2013/03/21/proof-of-the-cheeger-inequality-in-manifolds/">here</a>, and for our current purposes it will be enough to recall that, roughly speaking, a Riemann manifold defines a space on which we can define real-valued and complex-valued functions, and such functions can be integrated and differentiated. Subsets <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" /> of a Riemann manifold have, if they are measurable, a well defined volume, and their boundary <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpartial+S%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\partial S}" class="latex" /> a well defined lower-dimensional volume; it possible to define a Cheeger constant of a manifold in a way that is syntactically analogous to the definition of edge expansion:</p>

<p>It is also possible to define a Laplacian operator <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{L}" class="latex" /> on smooth functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%3A+M+%5Crightarrow+%7B%5Cmathbb+C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{f: M \rightarrow {\mathbb C}}" class="latex" />, and if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\lambda_2}" class="latex" /> is the second smallest eigenvalue of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{L}" class="latex" /> we have the characterization</p>

<p> which is syntactically almost the same inequality and, actually, has a syntactically very similar proof (the extra <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\sqrt 2}" class="latex" /> factor comes from the fact that things are normalized slightly differently).</p>
<p>The “dictionary” between finite graphs and compact manifolds is that vertices correspond to points, degree correspond to dimensionality, adjacent vertices <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{v}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{w}" class="latex" /> correspond to “infinitesimally close” points along one dimension, and the set of edges in the cut <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28S%2CV-S%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{(S,V-S)}" class="latex" /> correspond to the boundary <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpartial+S%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\partial S}" class="latex" /> of a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" />, “volume” corresponds to number of edges (both when we think of volume of the boundary and volume of a set), vectors <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Cin+%7B%5Cmathbb+R%7D%5EV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x\in {\mathbb R}^V}" class="latex" /> correspond to smooth functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%3A+M+%5Crightarrow+%7B%5Cmathbb+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{f: M \rightarrow {\mathbb R}}" class="latex" />, and the collection of values of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> at the neighbors of a vertex <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B+x_v+%3A+%28u%2Cv%29+%5Cin+E+%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\{ x_v : (u,v) \in E \}}" class="latex" /> corresponds to the gradient <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cnabla+f%28u%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\nabla f(u)}" class="latex" /> of a function at point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{u}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>Having made this long premise, the point of this post is that the inequality</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cphi%28G%29+%5Cgeq+%5Cfrac+%7B%5Clambda_2%7D2+%5C+%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \phi(G) \geq \frac {\lambda_2}2 \ , " class="latex" /></p>
<p> which is the easy direction to show in the graph case, does not hold for manifolds.</p>
<p>The easy proof for graphs is that if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28S%2CV-S%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{(S,V-S)}" class="latex" /> is the cut that realizes the minimum edge expansion, we can take <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%3D+%7B%5Cbf+1%7D_S%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x = {\bf 1}_S}" class="latex" />, or rather the projection of the above vector on the space orthogonal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{{\bf 1}}" class="latex" />, and a two-line calculation gives the inequality.</p>
<p>If, however, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" /> is a subset of points of the manifold that realizes the Cheeger constant, we cannot define <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28%5Ccdot%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{f(\cdot)}" class="latex" /> to be the indicator of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" />, because the function would not be smooth and its gradient would be undefined.</p>
<p>We could think of rescuing the proof by taking a smoothed version of the indicator of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" />, something that goes to 1 on one side and to 0 on the other side of the cut, as a function of the distance from the boundary. The “quadratic form” of such a function, however, would depend not just on the area of the boundary of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" />, but also on how quickly the volume of the subset of the manifold at distance <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\delta}" class="latex" /> from the boundary of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" /> grows as a function of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\delta}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>If the Ricci curvature of the manifold is negative, this volume grows very quickly, and the quadratic form of the smoothed function is very bad. The graph analog of this would be a graph made of two expanders joined by a bridge edge, and the problem is that the analogy between graphs and manifolds breaks down because “infinitesimal distance” in the manifold corresponds to any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bo%28%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{o(\log n)}" class="latex" /> distance on the graph, and although the bridge edge is a sparse cut in the graph, it is crossed by a lot of paths of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bo%28%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{o(\log n)}" class="latex" />, or at least this is the best intuition that I have been able to build about what breaks down here in the analogy between graphs and manifolds.</p>
<p>If the Ricci curvature of the manifold is non-negative and the dimension is bounded, there is however an inequality in manifolds that goes in the direction of the “easy graph Cheeger inequality,” and it has the form</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Clambda_2+%5Cleq+10+%5Cphi%5E2+%28M%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \lambda_2 \leq 10 \phi^2 (M) " class="latex" /></p>
<p> This is the <em>Buser inequality</em> for manifolds of non-negative Ricci curvature, and note how strong it is: it says that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%28M%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\phi(M)}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7B%5Clambda_2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\sqrt{\lambda_2}}" class="latex" /> approximate each other up to the constant factor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Csqrt%7B10%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2\sqrt{10}}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>If the Ricci curvature <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{R}" class="latex" /> is negative, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> is the dimension of the manifold, then one has the inequality</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Clambda_2+%5Cleq+2+%5Csqrt%7B%7CR%7C+%5Ccdot+%28n-1%29%7D+%5Ccdot+%5Cphi%28M%29+%2B+10+%5Cphi%5E2+%28M%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \lambda_2 \leq 2 \sqrt{|R| \cdot (n-1)} \cdot \phi(M) + 10 \phi^2 (M) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Given the importance that curvature has in the study of manifolds, there has been considerable interest in defining a notion of curvature for graphs. For example curvature relates to how quickly balls around a point grow with the diameter the ball, a concept that is of great importance in graphs as well; curvature is a locally defined concept that has a global consequences, and in graph property testing one is precisely interested in understanding global properties based on local ones; and a Buser-type inequality in graphs would be very interesting because it would provide a class of graphs for which Fiedler’s algorithm provides constant-factor approximation for sparsest cut.</p>
<p>There have been multiple attempts at defining notions of curvature for graphs, the main ones being Olivier curvature and Bakry-Emery curvature. Each captures some but not all of the useful properties of Ricci curvature in manifolds. My (admittedly, poorly informed) intuition is that curvature in manifold is defined “locally” but, as we mentioned above, “local” in graphs can have multiple meanings depending on the distance scale, and it is difficult to come up with a clean and usable definition that talks about multiple distance scales.</p>
<p>Specifically to the point of the Buser inequality, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.2561.pdf">Bauer et al</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.00516.pdf">Klartag et al</a> prove Buser inequalities for graphs with respect to the Bakry-Emery definition. Because Cayley graphs of Abelian groups happen to have curvature 0 according to this definition, their work gives the following result:</p>

<p>In particular, the above statement implies that if we have a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{d}" class="latex" />-regular Abelian Cayley graph then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt+%7B%5Clambda_2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\sqrt {\lambda_2}}" class="latex" /> provides an approximation of the sparsest cut up to a multiplicative error <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt+d%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{O(\sqrt d)}" class="latex" /> and that Fiedler’s algorithm is an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt+d%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{O(\sqrt d)}" class="latex" /> approximate algorithm for sparsest cut in Abelian Cayley graphs.</p>
<p>At some point in 2015 (or maybe 2014, during the Simons program on spectral graph theory?), I read the paper of Bauer at al. and wondered about a few questions. First of all, is there a way to prove the above theorem without using any notion of curvature?</p>
<p>Secondly, the theorem implies that Fiedler’s algorithm has a good approximation, but it does so in a very unusual way: we have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\lambda_2}" class="latex" /> that is a continuous relaxation of the sparsest cut problem, and we have Fiedler’s algorithm that, as analyzed by Cheeger’s inequality, provides a somewhat bad rounding, and finally the Buser inequality is telling us that the relaxation has very poor integrality gap on all Abelian Cayley graphs, and so even though the rounding seems bad it is actually good compared to the integral optimum. There should be an underlying reason for all this, meaning some other relaxation that has an actual integrality gap for sparsest cut that is at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt+d%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{O(\sqrt d)}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>I mentioned these questions to Shayan Oveis Gharan, and we were able to prove that if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BARV%28G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{ARV(G)}" class="latex" /> is the value of the Arora-Rao-Vazirani (or Goemans-Linial) semidefinite programming relaxation of sparsest cut, then, for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{d}" class="latex" />-regular Cayley graphs, we have</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Clambda_2+%5Cleq+O%28d%29+%5Ccdot+%28ARV%28G%29%29%5E2+%5Cleq+O%28d%29+%5Ccdot+%5Cphi%5E2+%28G%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \lambda_2 \leq O(d) \cdot (ARV(G))^2 \leq O(d) \cdot \phi^2 (G) " class="latex" /></p>
<p> which proves the above theorem and, together with the Cheeger inequality <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda_2+%5Cgeq+%5Cphi%5E2%28G%29%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\lambda_2 \geq \phi^2(G)/2}" class="latex" />, also shows</p>

<p> that is, the ARV relaxation has integrality gap at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt+d%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{O(\sqrt d)}" class="latex" /> on Abelian Cayley graphs.

<p id="block-79f77829-3f22-4392-8cc9-3f466129d855">A nice array of papers for this month, ranging from distribution testing, dense graph property testing, sublinear graph algorithms, and various mixtures of them. Let us now sample our spread!</p>



<p id="block-db4c65bf-46c4-4c3e-ad70-d3348de84ff3"><strong>A Lower Bound on the Complexity of Testing Grained Distributions</strong> by Oded Goldreich and Dana Ron (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/129/">ECCC</a>). A discrete distribution is called \(m\)-grained if all probabilities are integer multiples of \(1/m\). This paper studies the complexity of testing this property of distributions. For simplicity, consider the property of being \(n/2\)-grained, where the support size is \(n\). The classic lower bound for testing uniformity shows that \(\Omega(\sqrt{n})\) samples are required to distinguish the uniform distribution from a distribution uniform on \(n/2\) elements. Thus, we get a lower bound of \(\Omega(\sqrt{n})\) for testing \(n/2\)-grainedness (if I am permitted to use that word). This paper proves a lower bound of \(\Omega(n^c)\), for all constant \(c &lt; 1\). It is conjectured that the lower bound is actually \(\Omega(n/\log n)\), which would match the upper bound (for any label-invariant property).</p>



<p><strong>Testing Distributions of Huge Objects</strong> by Oded Goldreich and Dana Ron (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/133/">ECCC</a>). This paper introduced a new model that marries distribution testing with property testing on strings. The “object” of interest is a distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) over strings of length \(n\). We wish to test if \(\mathcal{D}\) possesses some property. The tester can get a random string \(x\) from the distribution, and can query any desired index of \(x\). The distance between distributions is defined using the earthmover distance (where we use the Hamming distance between strings). This model is called the DoHO (Distributions of Huge Objects) model. There are many questions posed and connections drawn to classical property testing and distribution testing. What I find interesting is a compelling application: the distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) may represent noisy or perturbed versions of a single object. The DoHO model gives a natural generalization of standard property testing to noisy objects. This paper considers problems such as testing if \(\mathcal{D}\) is: a random perturbation of a string, or a random cyclic shift, or a random isomorphism of a graph. </p>



<p><strong>Sublinear Time and Space Algorithms for Correlation Clustering via Sparse-Dense Decompositions</strong> by Sepehr Assadi and Chen Wang (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.14528.pdf">arXiv</a>). Correlation clustering is a classic problem where edges in a graph are labeled ‘+’ or ‘-‘, denoting whether these edges should be uncut or cut. The aim is to cluster the graph minimizing the total “disagreements” (cut ‘+’ edges or uncut ‘-‘ edges). This paper gives an \(O(1)\)-approximation algorithm that runs in \(O(n\log^2n)\) time; this is the first sublinear time approximation algorithm for this problem. Correlation clustering has seen results for the property testing/sublinear algorithms community, first by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5105">Bonchi, Garcia Soriano, and Kutzkov</a>. But previous results were essentially on the dense graph model, giving \(O(\epsilon n^2)\) error assuming adjacency matrix input. This paper considers access to the adjacency list of ‘+’ edges. Interestingly (from a technical standpoint), the key tool is a new <em>sparse-dense</em> decomposition. Such decompositions emerged from the seminal work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08886">Assadi-Chen-Khanna</a> for sublinear \((\Delta+1)\)-colorings, and it is great to see applications beyond coloring.</p>



<p><strong>Sublinear-Time Computation in the Presence of Online Erasures</strong> by Iden Kalemaj, Sofya Raskhodnikova, and Nithin Varma (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08745">arXiv</a>). Can property testing be done when portions of the input are hidden? This question was first raised by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05786">Dixit-Raskhodnikova-Thakurta-Varma</a>, who gave a model of <em>erasure-resilient testing.</em> There is an adversary who hides (erases) part of the input function; queries to those parts just yield a dummy symbol. This paper defines an online version of this model. There is an erasure parameter \(t\). On each query by the property tester, the adversary can erase \(t\) values of the function. Consider the property of classic linearity of functions \(f:\{0,1\}^d \rightarrow \{0,1\}\). The BLR tester queries triples of pairs \((x,y, x \oplus y)\). Observe how this tester is easily defeated by our adversary, by erasing the value \(f(x\oplus y)\). One of the main results of this paper is a \(O(1/\varepsilon)\)-query tester for linearity, that works for any constant erasure parameter \(t\). Note that this matches the bound for the standard setting. There are a number of results for other classic properties, such as monotonicity (sortedness) and Lipschitz.</p>



<p>S<strong>ublinear Time Eigenvalue Approximation via Random Sampling</strong> by Rajarshi Bhattacharjee, Cameron Musco, and Archan Ray (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07647">arXiv</a>). Consider the problem of estimating all the eigenvalues of a real, symmetric \(n \times n\) matrix \(M\) with bounded entries, in sublinear time. The main result shows that the eigenvalues of a uniform random \(O(\epsilon^{-4}\log n)\) principal submatrix can be used to approximate all eigenvalues of \(M\) up to additive error \(\epsilon n\). One can think of this as a sort of concentration inequality for eigenvalues. This result follows (and builds upon) work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06441">Bakshi-Chepurko-Jayaram</a> on property testing semidefiniteness. The key idea is that eigenvectors corresponding to large eigenvalues have small infinity norm: intuitively, since all entries in \(M\) are bounded, such an eigenvector must have its mass spread out among many coordinates. Hence, we can get information about it by randomly sampling a few coordinates. The paper also shows that approach of taking principal submatrices requires taking \(\Omega(\epsilon^{-2})\) columns/rows.</p>



<p><strong>Deterministic Graph Coloring in the Streaming Model</strong> by Sepehr Assadi, Andrew Chen, and Glenn Sun (arXiv). This is technically not a sublinear algorithms paper<em> (well ok, streaming is sublinear, but we tend not to cover the streaming literature. Maybe we should? – Ed.)</em> But, I think that the connections are of interest to our community of readers. The main tool of sublinear \((\Delta+1)\)-coloring algorithm of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08886">Assadi-Chen-Khanna</a> is the palette sparsification lemma (\(\Delta\) is the maximum degree). This lemma shows that vertices can randomly shorten their ”palette” of colors, after which all colorings from these palettes lead to very few monochromatic edges. This is an immensely powerful tool, since one can get immediately sublinear complexity algorithms in many models: adjacency list, streaming, distributed. Is the randomness necessary? Note that these algorithms run in \(\Omega(n)\) time/space, so it is conceivable that deterministic sublinear algorithms exists. This paper shows that randomization is necessary in the semi-streaming model (space \(O(n poly(\log n))\)). Indeed, there exist no deterministic semi-streaming algorithms that can achieve even \(\exp(\Delta^{o(1)})\) colorings.</p>

of differentially private machine learning that only protects the privacy of
the labels in the training set. Our mechanisms cluster the examples in the
training set using their (non-private) feature vectors, randomly re-sample each
label from examples in the same cluster, and output a training set with noisy
labels as well as a modified version of the true loss function. We prove that
when the clusters are both large and high-quality, the model that minimizes the
modified loss on the noisy training set converges to small excess risk at a
rate that is comparable to the rate for non-private learning. We describe both
a centralized mechanism in which the entire training set is stored by a trusted
curator, and a distributed mechanism where each user stores a single labeled
example and replaces her label with the label of a randomly selected user from
the same cluster. We also describe a learning problem in which large clusters
are necessary to achieve both strong privacy and either good precision or good
recall. Our experiments show that randomizing the labels within each cluster
significantly improves the privacy vs. accuracy trade-off compared to applying
uniform randomized response to the labels, and also compared to learning a
model via DP-SGD.

community of \emph{general} structure planted in a random graph. The detection
problem is formalized as a hypothesis testing problem, where under the null
hypothesis, the graph is a realization of an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph
$\mathcal{G}(n,q)$ with edge density $q\in(0,1)$; under the alternative, there
is an unknown structure $\Gamma_k$ on $k$ nodes, planted in $\mathcal{G}(n,q)$,
such that it appears as an \emph{induced subgraph}. In case of a successful
detection, we are concerned with the task of recovering the corresponding
structure. For these problems, we investigate the fundamental limits from both
the statistical and computational perspectives. Specifically, we derive lower
bounds for detecting/recovering the structure $\Gamma_k$ in terms of the
parameters $(n,k,q)$, as well as certain properties of $\Gamma_k$, and exhibit
computationally unbounded optimal algorithms that achieve these lower bounds.
We also consider the problem of testing in polynomial-time. As is customary in
many similar structured high-dimensional problems, our model undergoes an
"easy-hard-impossible" phase transition and computational constraints can
severely penalize the statistical performance. To provide an evidence for this
phenomenon, we show that the class of low-degree polynomials algorithms match
the statistical performance of the polynomial-time algorithms we develop.

K_{2,3}\}$. The class of outerplanar graphs is arguably the simplest class of
graphs for which no explicit kernelization size bounds are known. By exploiting
the combinatorial properties of outerplanar graphs we present elementary
reduction rules decreasing the size of a graph. This yields a constructive
kernel with $\mathcal{O}(k^4)$ vertices and edges. As a corollary, we derive
that any minor-minimal obstruction to having an outerplanar deletion set of
size $k$ has $\mathcal{O}(k^4)$ vertices and edges.

aim to optimize the parameters of CCGs so that the selfish behavior of
non-atomic players attains desirable equilibria. This model is essential for
designing such social infrastructures as traffic and communication networks.
Nevertheless, computational approaches to the model have not been thoroughly
studied due to two difficulties: (I) bilevel-programming structures and (II)
the combinatorial nature of CCGs. We tackle them by carefully combining (I) the
idea of \textit{differentiable} optimization and (II) data structures called
\textit{zero-suppressed binary decision diagrams} (ZDDs), which can compactly
represent sets of combinatorial strategies. Our algorithm numerically
approximates the equilibria of CCGs, which we can differentiate with respect to
parameters of CCGs by automatic differentiation. With the resulting
derivatives, we can apply gradient-based methods to Stackelberg models of CCGs.
Our method is tailored to induce Nesterov's acceleration and can fully utilize
the empirical compactness of ZDDs. These technical advantages enable us to deal
with CCGs with a vast number of combinatorial strategies. Experiments on
real-world network design instances demonstrate the practicality of our method.

</p>
<p>(i) $\mathcal{P} = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \colon A x \leq b\}$, where $A \in
\mathbb{Z}^{(n+m) \times n}$, $b \in \mathbb{Z}^{(n+m)}$, and $rank(A) = n$,

all the rank minors of $A$ be bounded by $\Delta$ in the absolute values. We
show that $|\mathcal{P} \cap \mathbb{Z}^n|$ can be computed with an algorithm,
having the arithmetic complexity bound $$ O\bigl(d^{m + 4} \cdot \Delta^4 \cdot
\log(\Delta) \bigr), $$ where $d = \dim(\mathcal{P})$, which outperforms the
previous best known complexity bound $O(d^{m + O(1)} \cdot
d^{\log_2(\Delta)})$.
</p>
<p>We do not directly compute the short rational generating function for
$\mathcal{P} \cap \mathbb{Z}^n$, but compute its particular representation in
the form of exponential series that depends on only one variable. The
parametric versions of the above problem are also considered.

sets of points as geometric shapes, with a special focus on convex sets and
polyhedral approximations. LazySets provides methods to apply common set
operations, convert between different set representations, and efficiently
compute with sets in high dimensions using specialized algorithms based on the
set types. LazySets is the core library of JuliaReach, a cutting-edge software
addressing the fundamental problem of reachability analysis: computing the set
of states that are reachable by a dynamical system from all initial states and
for all admissible inputs and parameters. While the library was originally
designed for reachability and formal verification, its scope goes beyond such
topics. LazySets is an easy-to-use, general-purpose and scalable library for
computations that mix symbolics and numerics. In this article we showcase the
basic functionality, highlighting some of the key design choices.

for the design of several quantum algorithms. Often, the running time of
quantum algorithms in this framework is characterized by the quantum hitting
time: the time required by the quantum walk to find a vertex of interest with a
high probability. In this article, we provide improved upper bounds for the
quantum hitting time that can be applied to several CTQW-based quantum
algorithms. In particular, we apply our techniques to the glued-trees problem,
improving their hitting time upper bound by a polynomial factor: from $O(n^5)$
to $O(n^2\log n)$. Furthermore, our methods also help to exponentially improve
the dependence on precision of the continuous-time quantum walk based algorithm
to find a marked node on any ergodic, reversible Markov chain by Chakraborty et

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: Every multivariate polynomial P(X) can be written as a sum of monomials, i.e. a sum of products of variables and field constants. In general, the size of such an expression is the number of monomials that have a non-zero coefficient in P.</p>
<p>What happens if we add another layer of complexity, and consider sums of products of sums (of variables and field constants) expressions? Now, it becomes unclear how to prove that a given polynomial P(X) does not have small expressions. In this result, we solve exactly this problem.</p>
<p>More precisely, we prove that certain explicit polynomials have no polynomial-sized “Sigma-Pi-Sigma” (sums of products of sums) representations. We can also show similar results for Sigma-Pi-Sigma-Pi, Sigma-Pi-Sigma-Pi-Sigma and so on for all “constant-depth” expressions.</p>
<p>The talk is based on a joint work of Nutan Limaye, Srikanth Srinivasan, and Sébastien Tavenas.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>Today the Italian academic community, along with lots of other people, was delighted to hear that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Parisi">Giorgio Parisi</a> is one of the three recipients of the 2021 Nobel Prize for Physics.</p>
<p>Parisi has been a giant in the area of understanding “complex” and “disordered” systems. Perhaps, his most influential contribution has been his “replica method” for the analysis of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. His ideas have led to several breakthroughs in statistical physics by Parisi and his collaborators, and they have also found applications in computer science: to tight analyses on a number of questions about combinatorial optimization on random graphs, to results on random constraint satisfaction problems (including the famous connection with random k-SAT analyzed by Mezard, Parisi and Zecchina) and random error correcting codes, and to understanding the solution landscape in optimization problems arising from machine learning. Furthermore these ideas have also led to the development and analysis of algorithms.</p>
<p>The news was particularly well received at Bocconi, where most of the faculty of the future CS department has done work that involved the replica method. (Not to be left out, even I <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05648">have recently used replica methods</a>.)</p>
<p>Mezard and Montanari have written a <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~montanar/RESEARCH/book.html">book-length treatment</a> on the interplay between ideas from statistical physics, algorithms, optimization, information theory and coding theory that arise from this tradition. Readers of <em>in theory</em> looking for a shorter exposition aimed at theoretical computer scientists will enjoy these <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2021/08/11/replica-method-for-the-machine-learning-theorist-part-1-of-2/">notes posted by Boaz Barak</a>, or <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2018/03/14/statistical-physics-dictionary/">this even shorter post by Boaz</a>.</p>
<p>In this post, I will try to give a sense to the reader of what the replica method for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model looks like when applied to the average-case analysis of optimization problems, stripped of all the physics. Of course, without the physics, nothing makes any sense, and the interested reader should look at Boaz’s posts (and to references that he provides) for an introduction to the context. I did not have time to check too carefully what I wrote, so be aware that several details could be wrong.</p>
<p>What is the typical value of the max cut in a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG_%7Bn%2C%5Cfrac+12%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G_{n,\frac 12}}" class="latex" /> random graph with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> vertices?</p>
<p>Working out an upper bound using union bounds and Chernoff bound, and a lower bound by thinking about a greedy algorithm, we can quickly convince ourselves that the answer is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac+%7Bn%5E2%7D%7B4%7D+%2B+%5CTheta%28n%5E%7B1.5%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\frac {n^2}{4} + \Theta(n^{1.5})}" class="latex" />. Great, but <em>what is the constant in front of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7B1.5%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n^{1.5}}" class="latex" />?</em> This question is answered by the <em>Parisi formula</em>, though this fact was not rigorously established by Parisi. (Guerra proved that the formula gives an upper bound, Talagrand proved that it gives a tight bound.)</p>
<p>Some manipulations can reduce the question above to the following question: suppose that I pick a random <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Ctimes+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n\times n}" class="latex" /> symmetric matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" />, say with zero diagonal, and such that (up to the symmetry requirement) the entries are mutually independent and each entry is equally likely to be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{+1}" class="latex" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{-1}" class="latex" />, or perhaps each entry is distributed according to a standard normal distribution (the two versions can be proved to be equivalent), what is the typical value of</p>

<p>As a first step, we could replace the maximum with a “soft-max,” and note that, for every choice of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%3E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\beta&gt;0}" class="latex" />, we have</p>

<p> The above upper bound gets tighter and tighter for larger <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\beta}" class="latex" />, so if we were able to estimate</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+%5Cmax+_%7Bx+%5Cin+%5C%7B%2B1%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%7D+%5C+%5C+x%5ET+M+x+%5Cleq+%5Cfrac+1+%5Cbeta+%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+%5Clog+%5Csum_%7Bx+%5Cin+%5C%7B%2B1%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%7D+e%5E%7B%5Cbeta+x%5ET+Mx%7D+%5Cleq+%5Cfrac+1+%5Cbeta+%5Clog+%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+%5Csum_%7Bx+%5Cin+%5C%7B%2B1%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%7D+e%5E%7B%5Cbeta+x%5ET+Mx%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \mathop{\mathbb E} \max _{x \in \{+1,1\}^n } \ \ x^T M x \leq \frac 1 \beta \mathop{\mathbb E} \log \sum_{x \in \{+1,1\}^n } e^{\beta x^T Mx} \leq \frac 1 \beta \log \mathop{\mathbb E} \sum_{x \in \{+1,1\}^n } e^{\beta x^T Mx} " class="latex" /></p>
<p> and then use linearity of expectation and independence of the entries of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> to get to</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cleq+%5Cfrac+1+%5Cbeta+%5Clog+%5Csum_%7Bx+%5Cin+%5C%7B%2B1%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%7D+%5Cprod_%7B1%5Cleq+i+%3C+j%5Cleq+n%7D+%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+e%5E%7B2%5Cbeta+M_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+x_i+x_j+%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \leq \frac 1 \beta \log \sum_{x \in \{+1,1\}^n } \prod_{1\leq i &lt; j\leq n} \mathop{\mathbb E} e^{2\beta M_{i,j} x_i x_j } " class="latex" /></p>
<p> Now things simplify quite a bit, because for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%3Cj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{i&lt;j}" class="latex" /> the expression <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+x_i+x_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M_{i,j} x_i x_j}" class="latex" />, in the Rademacher setting, is equally likely to be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{+1}" class="latex" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{-1}" class="latex" />, so that, for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta+%3D+o%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\beta = o(1)}" class="latex" />, we have</p>

<p> and</p>

<p> so that</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac+1+%5Cbeta+%5Clog+%5Csum_%7Bx+%5Cin+%5C%7B%2B1%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%7D+%5Cprod_%7B1%5Cleq+i+%3C+j%5Cleq+n%7D+%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+e%5E%7B2%5Cbeta+M_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+x_i+x_j+%7D+%5Cleq+%5Cfrac+%7BO%28n%29%7D%7B%5Cbeta%7D+%2B+O%28%5Cbeta+n%5E2%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \frac 1 \beta \log \sum_{x \in \{+1,1\}^n } \prod_{1\leq i &lt; j\leq n} \mathop{\mathbb E} e^{2\beta M_{i,j} x_i x_j } \leq \frac {O(n)}{\beta} + O(\beta n^2) " class="latex" /></p>
<p> which, choosing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta+%3D+1%2F%5Csqrt+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\beta = 1/\sqrt n}" class="latex" />, gives an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E%7B1.5%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{O(n^{1.5})}" class="latex" /> upper bound which is in the right ballpark. Note that this is exactly the same calculations coming out of a Chernoff bound and union bound. If we optimize the choice of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\beta}" class="latex" /> we unfortunately do not get the right constant in front of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7B1.5%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n^{1.5}}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>So, if we call</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++F+%3A%3D+%5Csum_%7Bx+%5Cin+%5C%7B%2B1%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%7D+e%5E%7B%5Cbeta+x%5ET+Mx%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  F := \sum_{x \in \{+1,1\}^n } e^{\beta x^T Mx} " class="latex" /></p>
<p> we see that we lose too much if we do the step</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+%5Clog+F+%5Cleq+%5Clog+%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+F+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \mathop{\mathbb E} \log F \leq \log \mathop{\mathbb E} F " class="latex" /></p>
<p> But what else can we do to get rid of the logarithm and to reduce to an expression in which we take expectations of products of independent quantities (if we are not able to exploit the assumption that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> has mutually independent entries, we will not be able to make progress)?</p>
<p>The idea is that if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%3E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k&gt;0}" class="latex" /> is a small enough quantity (something much smaller than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F%5Clog+F%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1/\log F}" class="latex" />), then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{F^k}" class="latex" /> is close to 1 and we have the approximation</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Clog+F%5Ek+%5Capprox+F%5Ek-1+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \log F^k \approx F^k-1 " class="latex" /></p>
<p> and we obviously have</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Clog+F%5Ek+%3D+k+%5Clog+F+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \log F^k = k \log F " class="latex" /></p>
<p> so we can use the approximation</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Clog+F+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac+1k+%28F%5Ek+-+1%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \log F \approx \frac 1k (F^k - 1) " class="latex" /></p>
<p> and</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+%5Clog+F+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac+1k+%28%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+F%5Ek+-+1%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \mathop{\mathbb E} \log F \approx \frac 1k (\mathop{\mathbb E} F^k - 1) " class="latex" /></p>
<p> Let’s forget for a moment that we want <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> to be a very small parameter. If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> was an integer, we would have</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+F%5Ek+%3D+%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+%5Cleft%28+%5Csum_%7Bx+%5Cin+%5C%7B%2B1%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%7D+e%5E%7B%5Cbeta+x%5ET+Mx%7D+%5Cright%29%5Ek+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bx%5E%7B%281%29%7D%2C%5Cldots+x%5E%7B%28k%29%7D+%5Cin+%5C%7B%2B1%2C-1%5C%7D%5En%7D+%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+e%5E%7B%5Cbeta+%5Ccdot+%28+x%5E%7B%281%29+T%7D+M+x%5E%7B%281%29%7D+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+x%5E%7B%28k%29T%7D+M+x%5E%7B%28k%29%7D%29+%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \mathop{\mathbb E} F^k = \mathop{\mathbb E} \left( \sum_{x \in \{+1,1\}^n } e^{\beta x^T Mx} \right)^k = \sum_{x^{(1)},\ldots x^{(k)} \in \{+1,-1\}^n} \mathop{\mathbb E} e^{\beta \cdot ( x^{(1) T} M x^{(1)} + \cdots + x^{(k)T} M x^{(k)}) } " class="latex" /></p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%3D+%5Csum_%7Bx%5E%7B%281%29%7D%2C%5Cldots+x%5E%7B%28k%29%7D+%5Cin+%5C%7B%2B1%2C-1%5C%7D%5En%7D+%5C+%5C+%5Cprod_%7Bi%3C+j%7D+%5C+%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+e%5E%7B2%5Cbeta+M_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+%5Ccdot+%28+x%5E%7B%281%29%7D_i+x%5E%7B%281%29%7D_j+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+x%5E%7B%28k%29%7D_i+x%5E%7B%28k%29%7D_j+%29%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  = \sum_{x^{(1)},\ldots x^{(k)} \in \{+1,-1\}^n} \ \ \prod_{i&lt; j} \ \mathop{\mathbb E} e^{2\beta M_{i,j} \cdot ( x^{(1)}_i x^{(1)}_j + \cdots + x^{(k)}_i x^{(k)}_j )} " class="latex" /></p>
<p> Note that the above expression involves choices of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />-tuples of feasible solutions of our maximization problem. These are the “replicas” in “replica method.”</p>
<p>The above expression does not look too bad, and note how we were fully able to use the independence assumption and “simplify” the expression. Unfortunately, it is actually still very bad. In this case it is preferable to assume the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_%7Bi%2Cj%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M_{i,j}}" class="latex" /> to be Gaussian, write the expectation as an integral, do a change of variable and some tricks so that we reduce to computing the maximum of a certain function, let’s call it <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%28z%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G(z)}" class="latex" />, where the input <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{z}" class="latex" /> is a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+%5Ctimes+k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k \times k}" class="latex" /> matrix, and then we have to guess what is an input of maximum value for this function. If we are lucky, the maximum is equivalent by a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{z}" class="latex" /> in which all entries are identical, the <em>replica symmetric solution</em>. In the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model we don’t have such luck, and the next guess is that the optimal <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{z}" class="latex" /> is a block-diagonal matrix, or a <em>replica symmetry-breaking solution</em>. For large <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />, and large number of blocks, we can approximate the choice of such matrices by writing down a system of differential equations, the <em>Parisi equations</em>, and we are going to assume that such equations do indeed describe an optimal <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{z}" class="latex" /> and so a solution to the integral, and so they give as a computation of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+F%5Ek+-+1%29%2Fk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{(\mathop{\mathbb E} F^k - 1)/k}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>After all this, we get an expression for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D+F%5Ek+-+1%29%2Fk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{(\mathop{\mathbb E} F^k - 1)/k}" class="latex" /> for every sufficiently large integer <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />, as a function of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> up to lower order errors. What next? Remember how we wanted <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> to be a tiny real number and not a sufficiently large integer? Well, we take the expression, we forget about the error terms, and we set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%3D0%5Cldots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k=0\ldots}" class="latex" /></p></div>

<p>1. Huge congratulations to the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2021/summary/">winners</a> of this year’s Nobel Prize in Physics: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syukuro_Manabe">Syukuro Manabe</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Hasselmann">Klaus Hasselmann</a> for climate modelling, and separately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Parisi">Giorgio Parisi</a> for statistical physics.  While I don’t know the others, I had the great honor to get to know Parisi three years ago, when he was chair of the committee that awarded me the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3955">Tomassoni-Chisesi Prize in Physics</a>, and when I visited Parisi’s department at Sapienza University of Rome to give the prize lecture and collect the award.  I remember Parisi’s kindness, a lot of good food, and a lot of discussion of the interplay between theoretical computer science and physics.  Note that, while much of Parisi’s work is beyond my competence to comment on, in computer science he’s very well-known for applying statistical physics methods to the analysis of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0212002">survey propagation</a>—an algorithm that revolutionized the study of random 3SAT when it was introduced two decades ago.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>2. Two weeks ago, a group at Google <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11525">put out a paper</a> with a new efficient classical algorithm to simulate the recent Gaussian BosonSampling experiments from USTC in China.  They argued that this algorithm called into question USTC’s claim of BosonSampling-based quantum supremacy.  Since then, I’ve been in contact with Sergio Boixo from Google, Chaoyang Lu from USTC, and Jelmer Renema, a Dutch BosonSampling expert and friend of the blog, to try to get to the bottom of this.  Very briefly, the situation seems to be that Google’s new algorithm outperforms the USTC experiment on one particular metric: namely, <em>total variation distance from the ideal marginal distribution, if (crucially) you look at only a subset of the optical modes</em>, <em>say 14 modes out of 144 total</em>.  Meanwhile, though, if you look at the k<sup>th</sup>-order correlations for large values of k, then the USTC experiment continues to win.  With the experiment, the correlations fall off exponentially with k but still have a meaningful, detectable signal even for (say) k=19, whereas with Google’s spoofing algorithm, you choose the k that you want to spoof (say, 2 or 3), and then the correlations become nonsense for larger k.</p>



<p>Now, given that you were only ever <em>supposed</em> to see a quantum advantage from BosonSampling if you looked at the k<sup>th</sup>-order correlations for large values of k, and given that we already knew, from the work of Leonid Gurvits, that <em>very</em> small marginals in BosonSampling experiments would be easy to reproduce on a classical computer, my inclination is to say that USTC’s claim of BosonSampling-based quantum supremacy still stands.  On the other hand, it’s true that, with BosonSampling especially, more so than with qubit-based random circuit sampling, we currently lack an adequate theoretical understanding of what the <em>target</em> should be.  That is, which numerical metric should an experiment aim to maximize, and how well does it have to score on that metric before it’s plausibly outperforming any fast classical algorithm?  One thing I feel confident about is that, whichever metric is chosen—Linear Cross-Entropy or whatever else—it needs to capture the k<sup>th</sup>-order correlations for large values of k.  No metric that’s insensitive to those correlations is good enough.</p>

<p>3. Like many others, I was outraged and depressed that MIT <a href="https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/mit-abandons-its-mission-and-me">uninvited Dorian Abbot</a> (see also <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/mit-cancels-geophysicists-lecture-after-activists-outrage-over-his-views-diversity-1635371">here</a>), a geophysicist at the University of Chicago, who was slated to give the Carlson Lecture in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences about the atmospheres of extrasolar planets.  The reason for the cancellation was that, totally unrelatedly to his scheduled lecture, Abbot had <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/diversity-problem-campus-opinion-1618419">argued in <em>Newsweek</em></a> and elsewhere that Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives should aim for equality for opportunity rather than equality of outcomes, a Twitter-mob decided to go after him in retaliation, and they succeeded.  It should go without saying that it’s perfectly reasonable to <strong>disagree</strong> with Abbot’s stance, to <strong>counterargue</strong>—if those very concepts haven’t gone the way of floppy disks.  It should also go without saying that the MIT EAPS department chair is <em>free</em> to bow to social-media pressure, as he did, rather than standing on principle … just like I’m <em>free</em> to criticize him for it.  To my mind, though, cancelling a scientific talk because of the speaker’s centrist (!) political views completely, 100% validates the right’s narrative about academia, that it’s become a fanatically intolerant echo chamber.  To my fellow progressive academics, I beseech thee in the bowels of Bertrand Russell: <em>why would you commit such an unforced error?</em></p>



<p>Yes, one can <em>imagine</em> views (e.g., open Nazism) so hateful that they might justify the cancellation of unrelated scientific lectures by people who hold those views, as many physicists after WWII refused to speak to Werner Heisenberg.  But it seems obvious to me—as it would’ve been obvious to everyone else not long ago—that no matter where a reasonable person draws the line, Abbot’s views as he expressed them in <em>Newsweek</em> don’t come within a hundred miles of it.  To be more explicit still: if Abbot’s views justify deplatforming him as a planetary scientist, then <strong>all my quantum computing and theoretical computer science lectures deserve to be cancelled too</strong>, for the many attempts I’ve made on this blog over the past 16 years to share my honest thoughts and life experiences, to write like a vulnerable human being rather than like a university press office.  While I’m sure some sneerers gleefully embrace that implication, I ask everyone else to consider how deeply they believe in the idea of academic freedom at all—keeping in mind that such a commitment <em>only ever gets tested</em> when there’s a chance someone might denounce you for it.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update:</span></strong> Princeton’s James Madison Program has <a href="https://jmp.princeton.edu/events/climate-and-potential-life-other-planets">volunteered</a> to host Abbot’s Zoom talk in place of MIT.  The talk is entitled “Climate and the Potential for Life on Other Planets.”  Like probably hundreds of others who heard about this only because of the attempted cancellation, I plan to attend!</p>

<p> (Disclosure - Harry Lewis was my PhD advisor.)</p><p><br /></p><p>It seems like just a few weeks ago I I blogged about a book of Harry Lewis's that was recently available (see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/08/what-are-most-important-46-papers-in.html">here</a>).  And now I am blogging about another one. Writing two books in two years seems hard! I can only think of one other computer scientist who has done that recently (see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Muffin-Morsels-Problem-Mathematics-ebook/dp/B08BJ4G2Z1/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=gasarch&amp;qid=1626492618&amp;sr=8-2">here</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Problems-Point-Exploring-Computer-Science/dp/9813279729/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=gasarch+point&amp;qid=1626492655&amp;sr=8-2">here</a>).</p><p><br /></p><p>In 2008 Abelson, Ledeen, and Lewis wrote </p><p><i>Blown to Bits: Your Life, Liberty, and Happiness after the Digital Explosion</i></p><p>which I reviewed in SIGACT news, see <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/bitsbook.pdf">here</a></p><p><br /></p><p>Both computers and society have changed since 2008. Hence an update was needed. </p><p>In 2021 Adelson, Ledeen, Lewis, and Seltzer wrote a second edition.</p><p><br /></p><p>Should you buy the new version if you bought the old version? </p><p>1) Not my problem- I got them both for free since I reviewed them. </p><p>2) Not your problem- The second edition is available free-on-line <a href="https://www.bitsbook.com/thebook/">here</a>. Is that a link to some dark corner of the dark web? No, its the formal webpage about the book. So the book is available free-on-line legally, if you care (and even if you don't care). </p><p>3) If you like paper, the book is on amazon. (If you don't like paper, the book is still on amazon). </p><p><br /></p><p>I reviewed it in SIGACT news. A non-paywalled link: <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/b2bits2.pdf">here</a> (is that link legal? I have no idea.) </p><p>In this post I'll just mention two things that changed since the last book</p><p>1) Shared Music and pirating were an issue back in 2008.  It does not seem to be anymore since there is now a variety of services that seem to make pirating not worth it: itunes, streaming services, and some bands give it away for free and ask you to pay what its worth. Movies are still struggling with this issue. </p><p>2) AI systems that reinforce existing bias is a new problem.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>I just added to Wikipedia two articles on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan%E2%80%93P%C3%B3lya_number">Jordan–Pólya numbers</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibbinary_number">fibbinary numbers</a>, two integer sequences used in <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/09/24/which-integer-sequences.html">my recent paper on Egyptian fractions</a>. Jordan–Pólya numbers are the products of factorials, while the fibbinary numbers are the ones with binary representations having no two consecutive 1’s. The OEIS page on the fibbinary numbers, <a href="https://oeis.org/A003714">A003714</a>, lists many ways of generating this sequence algorithmically, of which most are boring or slow (generate all binary numbers and test which ones belong to the sequence; you can test if a variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> is fibbinary by checking that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x&amp;(x&gt;&gt;1)</code> is zero). I thought it might be interesting to highlight two of those methods that are a little more clever and generate these numbers in small numbers of operations.</p>

<p>Some functional languages, and in part Python even though it’s mostly not functional, have a notion of a stream, a potentially infinite sequence of values generated by a coroutine. In Python, you can program these using <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/">simple generators</a> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yield</code> keyword. I wrote here long ago about <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2011/10/02/generating-permutations-with.html">methods for using generators recursively</a>: a generator can call itself, manipulate the resulting sequence of values, and pass them on to its output. It’s actually a very old idea, used for instance to generate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_number">regular numbers</a> by Dijkstra <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~black/AdvancedProgramming/Lectures/Smalltalk%20II/Dijkstra%20on%20Hamming%27s%20Problem.pdf">in his 1976 book <em>A Discipline of Programming</em></a>. Reinhard Zumkeller used the same idea to generate the fibbinary numbers in Haskell, based on the observation that the sequence of positive fibbinary numbers can be generated, starting from the number 1, by two operations, doubling smaller values or replacing a smaller value \(x\) with \(4x+1\). Here is is, translated into Python:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">heapq</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">merge</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">affine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">stream</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">stream</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">b</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">fibbinary</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">merge</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">affine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fibbinary</span><span class="p">(),</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="n">affine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fibbinary</span><span class="p">(),</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)):</span>
        <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">x</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It’s elegant, but has a couple of minor flaws. First, it omits the number \(0\), and while it can be modified to include \(0\), the modifications make the code messier. But second, it takes more than a constant amount of time per element to generate each sequence element. A fibbinary number \(x\) has to be generated from a sequence of smaller elements by repeated doubling and quadrupling, and that takes \(\log x\) steps per element. Even if we assume those steps to take constant time each, generating the first \(n\) elements in this way takes time \(\Theta(n\log n)\). It’s better than the \(\Theta(n^{\log_\varphi 2})\approx n^{1.44}\) that you would get from generate-and-test, but still not as good as we might hope for. One way to fix this would be to memoize the generator, so that the recursive calls look at a stored copy of the sequence generated by the outer call rather than generating the same sequence redundantly, but this again makes the code messier and also takes more storage than necessary.</p>

<p>Instead, Jörg Arndt observed that you can generate each fibbinary number directly from the previous one by a process closely resembling binary addition. Adding one to a binary number sets the first available bit from zero to one, and zeros out all the smaller bits; here, a bit is available if it is already zero. Finding the next fibbinary number does the same thing, but with a different definition of availability: a bit is available if both it and the next larger bit are zero. We can find the available bit using binary addition on a modified word that fills in bits whose neighbor is nonzero. Using this idea, we can generate the fibbinary numbers in a constant number of bitwise binary word-level operations per number. Here it is again in Python, translated from Arndt’s C++ and simplified based on <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@efroach76/107037399683569338">a comment by efroach76</a>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">fibbinary</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">x</span>
        <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">~</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">y</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It’s even possible to use the same idea to generate the fibbinary numbers in a constant amortized number of bit-level operations per number, although this ends up being a little less efficient in practice because high-level languages end up translating all these bit operations into word operations anyway.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">fibbinary</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">x</span>
        <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
        <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">&amp;=~</span> <span class="n">y</span>
            <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
        <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">|=</span> <span class="n">y</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The inner loop ends immediately at fibbinary numbers whose successor is odd (at positions given by the ones of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_word">Fibonacci word</a>), whose fraction of the total is \(1-1/\varphi\approx 0.382\), where \(\varphi\) is the golden ratio. It ends in two steps for the remaining values when their next bit is odd, in the same proportion, and so on. So the average number of steps for the inner loop adds in a geometric series to \(O(1)\).</p>

In this note, we show the mixing of three-term progressions $(x, xg, xg^2)$ in every finite quasirandom group, fully answering a question of Gowers. More precisely, we show that for any $D$-quasirandom group $G$ and any three sets $A_1, A_2, A_3 \subset G$, we have
\[ \left|\Pr_{x,y\sim G}\left[ x \in A_1, xy \in A_2, xy^2 \in A_3\right] - \prod_{i=1}^3 \Pr_{x\sim G}\left[x \in A_i\right] \right| \leq \left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{D}}\right)^{\frac14}.\] 
Prior to this, Tao answered this question when the underlying quasirandom group is $\mathrm{SL}_{d}(\mathbb{F}_q)$. Subsequently, Peluse extended the result to all nonabelian finite simple groups. In this work, we show that a slight modification of Peluse's argument is sufficient to fully resolve Gower's quasirandom conjecture for 3-term progressions. Surprisingly, unlike the proofs of Tao and Peluse, our proof is elementary and only uses basic facts from nonabelian Fourier analysis.</div>

There is a sense of tangible joy among the participants just to be sharing the same physical space, let alone the fantastic environs of the Institute. The renewed energy is all there to witness in the programs this semester on <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/si2021"><u>Computational Complexity of Statistical Inference</u></a> (CCSI) and <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/gmos2021"><u>Geometric Methods in Optimization and Sampling</u></a> (GMOS), both of which are now in full swing. Although masking is maintained, it doesn’t seem to change the quintessential Simons program experience even a little bit. I am referring, of course, to the constant feeling of missing out on all the incredibly interesting activities going on, much of which one is unable to fit into their schedule.</p>



<p>At least some of the palpable energy can be attributed to over 40 postdocs and research fellows who have arrived at the Institute this semester, many of whom will stay on for a year or two. This extraordinary group of young researchers covers the whole gamut of topics, ranging from cryptography, quantum computing, and fairness to machine learning, data structures, algorithms, and complexity theory. Each of these postdocs and fellows gave a 10-minute presentation at the “Meet the Fellows’’ welcome event that the Institute held on September 8 and 9. Check out their <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/events/meet-fellows-welcome-event-wednesday-schedule"><u>talks</u></a> for glimpses of the cutting edge in all these subfields of theory.</p>



<p><strong>An advance in algebraic circuit complexity</strong><br />
	This time around, there is some good news from the front lines on circuit complexity, one of the most challenging arenas within theoretical computer science.</p>



<p>An algebraic circuit consists of gates, each of which carries out either addition or multiplication over some field, say real numbers. The depth of the circuit is the length of the longest path from the output to one of its inputs. Naturally, an algebraic circuit computes a polynomial over its inputs.</p>



<p>In the world of Boolean circuits with AND/OR/NOT gates, lower bounds against constant depth circuits, aka AC0 circuit lower bounds, have been known since the 1980s and are one of the most influential results in complexity theory. For general algebraic circuits over a large field (say reals), even superpolynomial lower bounds for depth three circuits had remained elusive. In a <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/081/">remarkable paper</a>, Nutan Limaye, Srikanth Srinivasan, and Sébastien Tavenas have obtained the first superpolynomial lower bounds against general algebraic circuits of all constant depths over fields of characteristic zero (say reals). Furthermore, the lower-bound result is shown for a simple polynomial known as “iterated matrix multiplication” whose input consists of \(d\) matrices \(X_1,\ldots,X_d\) of dimension \(n \times n\), and the goal is to compute a fixed entry of their product \(X_1 \cdot X_2 \cdots X_d\). The same work also obtains a depth hierarchy theorem for algebraic circuits showing that for every depth <em>D</em>, there is an explicit polynomial that can be computed by a depth <em>D</em> circuit of size <em>s</em>, but requires circuits of size superpolynomial in <em>s</em> if the depth is <em>D</em>-1.</p>



<p><strong>Remarkable work of Matthew Brennan</strong><br /> The theory community suffered a terrible loss this year with the tragic and untimely passing of one of our rising stars, Matthew Brennan. While still a graduate student at MIT, Matthew almost single-handedly pushed forward an ambitious research program at the intersection of computational complexity and statistics. Here we will try to give a glimpse of Matthew’s extensive body of research.</p>



<span id="more-595"></span>



<p></p>



<p>To set the context, traditionally the field of computational complexity has been concerned with characterizing how much memory or computational power is needed, while statistics sheds light on how much data are needed. The interplay between computational and statistical resources and their underlying trade-offs is only recently coming into focus.</p>



<p>Many statistical estimation tasks exhibit information-computation gaps wherein the accuracy obtained by efficient algorithms is strictly worse than the estimate that one could in principle extract from the data if there were no computational limitations. In other problems, there is an apparent trade-off between the number of samples needed for an estimation task and the computational power of the estimation algorithm.</p>



<p>Identifying and rigorously establishing the presence of these information-computation trade-offs is a fundamental challenge that has drawn much interest in theoretical computer science and statistics. To rigorously establish an information-computation gap, one would need to prove lower bounds against efficient algorithms for statistical estimation problems.</p>



<p>Here on, there are two routes that one could take. First, one can prove limitations for specific classes of algorithms like MCMC, spectral methods, semidefinite programming, statistical queries, and so on. This approach has been highly successful, yielding precise lower bounds in many models and numerous relations discovered between the models.</p>



<p>Alternatively, one can take the grander route: assume the intractability of a well-studied computational problem and use <em>reductions</em> to establish hardness of the statistical estimation problem at hand. In a seminal work, Berthet and Rigollet showed a reduction from the planted clique problem to the sparse principal component analysis (sparse PCA), thereby establishing the presence of an information-computation gap for a version of sparse PCA.</p>



<p>In its most canonical setup, the input to the sparse PCA problem consists of samples from a \(d\)-dimensional Gaussian with covariance \(\Sigma = I_d + \theta vv^T\), where \(v\) is a \(k\)-sparse unit vector and \(\theta\) denotes the signal strength. A simple hypothesis testing variant of the problem asks to distinguish \(n\) samples drawn from this spiked covariance matrix and \(n\) samples drawn from the standard Gaussian distribution.</p>



<p>Notice that statistical estimation problems like sparse PCA are most interesting when their inputs are drawn from some natural distribution like the Gaussian distribution. Therefore, a reduction from a hard problem <em>A</em> to a statistical estimation problem <em>B</em> will not only have to map instances of <em>A</em> to instances of <em>B</em>, but also have to produce the right distribution over instances of <em>B</em>. For example, ideally a reduction from planted clique to sparse PCA must map instances of planted clique (random graphs with cliques) to random vectors drawn from an appropriate Gaussian measure. How could a reduction ever do this, one might ask.</p>



<p>In fact, this is why one might decide not to take the grand route of using reductions to understand the complexity of statistical problems. While reductions have been exceptionally successful in establishing tight hardness results for <em>NP</em>-complete optimization problems, building a similar web of reductions for statistical problems like sparse PCA seemed hopeless to me. Not for Matthew, who courageously took this challenge head-on and succeeded!</p>



<p>Despite efforts following the seminal work of Berthet and Rigollet, showing a tight hardness result for sparse PCA in its most canonical Gaussian setup seemed out of reach. In a series of works, Matthew and coauthors developed a set of simple reduction tools that when put together led to a tight characterization of the complexity of the sparse PCA problem in its most canonical setup, over the entire range of parameters!</p>



<p>More recently, Matthew and his advisor, Guy Bresler, proposed a generalized planted clique conjecture referred to as “secret leakage planted clique” that can serve as a starting point for a web of reductions encompassing a variety of problems such as tensor PCA, robust sparse mean estimation, and semirandom community recovery. Not only have these works developed a set of useful reduction techniques for statistical problems, but most importantly, they have demonstrated that reductions can indeed be harnessed toward tight hardness results for statistical problems. Matthew was a recipient of the best student paper award at the Conference on Learning Theory (COLT) on two separate occasions for this line of work.</p>



<p>Matthew’s work is one of the central themes of this semester’s program on Computational Complexity of Statistical Inference. His work has laid the foundations of a theory of reductions for statistical problems, something for us to build on over the coming years. While his ideas are ever present this semester, his presence at the program is sorely missed.</p></div>

<p>If you have Netflix and interested in the academic world, I recommend <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81206259">The Chair</a>, a six-episode dramatic series starring Sandra Oh as a new English department chair at a "lower tier ivy league university". The series takes many artistic liberties and compresses much in a short time period but gets much about academics right such as the tension between faculty and the administration with the chair caught in the middle, the need to create majors that attract students, faculty past their prime teaching the same courses in the same way for decades, faculty who get themselves in a hole and keep digging, alumni donors controlling academic decisions, pressure to build a diverse faculty, faculty feeling under appreciated and getting outside offers, and a wonderful exposition of how the field has changed over the past thirty years given to someone who had dropped out before finishing their PhD to take on a different career.</p><p>When I served as department chair at Georgia Tech, I dealt with most if not all of these issues above, though not at the same time. I had some challenges that today's English department doesn't face: how to handle enrollments that more than doubled while barely able to hire more faculty than were departing, not that I would trade in a second for the existential crisis that English departments are going through. </p><p>When I left Georgia Tech after seven years, I had outlasted every other current chair in the Colleges of Computing, Science and Engineering. Not sure what this says about me or about Georgia Tech.</p><p>Being chair is the most challenging job in academia. The faculty technically report to you but you aren't their boss in any traditional sense--they came to academia because of the freedom to work on what they want and they won't give it up. It's virtually impossible to fire anyone with tenure. The joke goes that a chair needs two umbrellas, one to block stuff coming from the administration going to the faculty and the other to block the stuff from the faculty from going to the administration. Since I left it has gotten much uglier in the University System of Georgia which has no mask or vaccine mandates and glad I'm not the chair to deal with that.</p><p>This all sounds like I'm discouraging of becoming a department chair and it certainly isn't a job for anyone but it can be a very rewarding job. You can help shape the future of the department by the faculty you hire and the vision you set and create an environment that helps your faculty and students succeed. </p></div>

Maryna Viazovska was the first person to prove an exact bound on sphere packing in a dimension higher than 3. She <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.04246.pdf">achieved</a> this for dimension 8 in 2016 by making an improvement of <b>0.00001</b> over one previous <a href="https://annals.math.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/annals-v157-n2-p09.pdf">paper</a> by Henry Cohn and Noam Elkies. This also led to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06518.pdf">solution</a> in dimension 24, joint with Cohn and Abhinav Kumar, Stephen Miller, and Danylo Radchenko.</p>
<p>
Today we talk about partial progress—baby steps—and its relation to solving conjectures.</p>
<p>
This post is a continuation of our recent <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/08/10/p-vs-np-proof-claims/">thoughts</a> about how those who claim to have solved a major problem almost always claim to have solved the whole thing in one large leap. We’ve thought about declaring a rule that any claim on a major open problem, at least about complexity lower bounds, must first be a <em>partial result</em>. We will give concrete suggestions in that direction at the end. But on reflection, we’ll curb the dogmatics a little.</p>
<p>
In her 2016 <em>Quanta</em> <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/sphere-packing-solved-in-higher-dimensions-20160330">article</a> on Viazovska’s breakthrough, Erica Klarreich quotes Peter Sarnak:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “It’s stunningly simple, as all great things are. You just start reading the paper and you know this is correct.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
We hasten to add that the paper’s correctness is evident amid the context that others had established over the previous two decades, going back at least to Thomas Hales’s voluminous proof of Johannes Kepler’s conjecture for dimension 3. To quote Klarreich:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Researchers have known for more than a decade what the missing ingredient in the proof [of optimality for dimensions 8 and 24] should be—an “auxiliary” function that can calculate the largest allowable sphere density—but they couldn’t find the right function. … [F]inding the right modular form allowed Viazovska to prove [the case of 8] in a mere 23 pages. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Thus Viazovska brought in a new tool to the problem, <em>modular forms</em>, which had already proved their merit in resolving the Fermat conjecture. But she still needed to choose the right modular form among many candidates. Klarreich quotes her as saying it is difficult even just to explain how she knew which one to use. This brings us back to the challenge of explaining—or debunking—the flash of insight that claimers claim to have. At least in this case, per Sarnak’s quote, the proof was in the pudding.</p>

<p>
To complete the mixing of our original message, the examples we chose happen to involve improvements by tiny amounts. We’ve even understated Viazovska’s above: reckoned against a later <a href="https://annals.math.princeton.edu/2009/170-3/p01">paper</a> by Cohn and Elkies, her improvement was </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++0.000000000000000000000000000001.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  0.000000000000000000000000000001. " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
The recent <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2020/10/26/a-vast-and-tiny-breakthrough/">post</a> where we discussed the phrase “the proof is in the pudding” involves a number with six more <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{0}" class="latex" />s than that. These are <b>not</b> what we mean by “baby steps.” But let us tell our next story, which also involves Cohn.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Steps Toward Matrix Multiplication </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We have <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/11/29/a-breakthrough-on-matrix-product/">covered</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/12/03/the-meaning-of-omega/">other</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2012/02/01/a-brief-history-of-matrix-product/">work</a> on the exponent <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Comega%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\omega}" class="latex" /> of matrix product. This means the infimum of all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{e}" class="latex" /> such that any two <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Ctimes+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n \times n}" class="latex" /> matrices can be multiplied in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5Ee%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{O(n^e)}" class="latex" /> unit operations. In 1990, Don Coppersmith and Shmuel Winograd <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717108800132">brought</a> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Comega%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\omega}" class="latex" /> down below <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2.375477%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2.375477}" class="latex" />. The current best bound <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Comega+%3C+2.37286%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\omega &lt; 2.37286}" class="latex" /> is from a SODA 2021 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05846">paper</a> by Josh Alman and Virginia Williams; its abstract highlights the improvement by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.00001%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{0.00001}" class="latex" /> from the previous best.</p>
<p>
In 2005, however, Cohn wrote a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0511460.pdf">paper</a> with Robert Kleinberg, Balazs Szegedy, and Christopher Umans on ideas for taking <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Comega%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\omega}" class="latex" /> all the way down to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2}" class="latex" /> in one jump. This diverges from both the reading of “baby step” as “tiny improvement” and our idea meaning limited-but-definite partial progress. Their strategy for the full jump has come in and out of clouds since then. But their paper has motivated the subsequent partial progress in several ways. We have <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2010/03/27/fast-matrix-products-and-other-amazing-results/">mentioned</a> this paper <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/04/30/test-of-time/">several</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2012/06/22/cricket-400-and-complexity-theory/">times</a>, notably <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2018/08/30/limits-on-matrix-multiplication/">here</a>. </p>
<p>
The objective need not be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2}" class="latex" /> versus <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2.372...%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2.372...}" class="latex" />, however. There is a notable milepost just above <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2.30%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2.30}" class="latex" />. It comes from a STOC 2015 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5414">paper</a> by Andris Ambainis, Yuval Flimus, and François Le Gall. It shows that a wide class of techniques of the kind used since 1990 cannot achieve better than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Comega+%3C+2.3078%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\omega &lt; 2.3078}" class="latex" />. </p>
<p>
Other recent <a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2018/8360/pdf/LIPIcs-ITCS-2018-25.pdf">work</a> by Alman and Williams shows both a dimension along which the road down to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2}" class="latex" /> may still be open but other limits in other directions. Even their new <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.00001%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{0.00001}" class="latex" /> improvement has new ideas that may be exploited more generally. This is a feature of partial progress that contrasts with what we said <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/08/10/p-vs-np-proof-claims/">recently</a> about not learning much from whole-jump attempts: partial progress always shows a higher learning curve.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Some Partial Progress Objectives </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Cohn also has a page of informal <a href="http://math.mit.edu/~cohn/Thoughts/">thoughts</a> on how to perform research, including <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~cohn/Thoughts/advice.html">advice</a> for those who claim to have solved some open problem. We want to add this advice:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Make sure ahead of time that your advance really covers the intermediate ground it jumps through. Even better, walk back your claim a little so that it proves something only a step or so beyond previous knowledge. </em>

Here are a few examples of such things to prove in complexity theory:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%5Cneq+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}" class="latex" />: The claim is that SAT requires exponential time. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>A Baby Step</b>: Prove SAT cannot be done in linear time. Or that it cannot be done in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n^2}" class="latex" /> time.
</li></ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Circuit Lower Bounds</b>: The claim is that some concrete problem in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" /> requires super-polynomial size general circuits. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>A Baby Step</b>: Prove that some concrete problem cannot be done in a linear size boolean circuit–or one of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B6n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{6n}" class="latex" />.
</li></ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Factoring</b>: The claim is that factoring a general number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N}" class="latex" /> requires super-polynomial time in the bit-length of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N}" class="latex" />. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>A Baby Step</b>: Prove that factoring cannot be done in linear time. Or not in quadratic time. See <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~cohn/Thoughts/factoring.html">this</a>.
</li></ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Graph Isomorphism</b>: The claim is that there is polynomial-time algorithm to tell whether two graphs are isomorphic. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>A Baby Step</b>: Prove the case where the graphs have degree a fixed constant.
</li></ul>
<p>
This is an example of a baby step that is already done. Note: it was not an easy step. It is a famous result of Eugene Luks—see his 1982 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022000082900095">paper</a>. </p>
<p></p><p><br />
We could go deeper into known computational complexity issues to find more. The idea applies to problems from mathematics in general. Here is one:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Riemann Hypothesis”</b> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis">claim</a> is of course that 	<p></p>

<p>only happens for negative even integers and for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{s}" class="latex" /> with real part <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1/2}" class="latex" />. The latter are the zeroes in the <i>critical strip</i> where the real part is between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{0}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1}" class="latex" />. The sum is convergent for real part <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3E+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{&gt; 1}" class="latex" /> and its analytic continuation for other <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{s}" class="latex" /> is understood.</p>

<b>A Baby Step</b>: Prove that it is impossible for just two zeroes to be off the half line. Or that only a finite number can be off the half line.

</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What are some additional first steps? </p>
<p>
Have we also—unintendedly but effectively—made a case for the value of tiny improvements? At least when they are conceptual improvements?</p>
<p>
Here is the answer to the puzzle in the previous <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/09/26/a-possible-ramsey-insight-into-p-versus-np/">post</a>: Barbara wins. She forces the sum of every row to be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{0}" class="latex" />.

We study a natural and quite general model of branch-and-bound algorithms. In this model, an algorithm attempts to minimize (or maximize) a function $f : D \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ by making oracle queries to a heuristic $h_f$ satisfying 
\[
    \min_{x \in S} f(x) \leq h_f(S) \leq \gamma \cdot \min_{x \in S} f(x)
\]
for some $\gamma \geq 1$ and any subset $S$ in some allowed class of subsets $\mathcal{S}$ of the domain $D$. We show tight upper and lower bounds on the number of queries $q$ needed to find even a $\gamma'$-approximate minimizer for quite large $\gamma'$ in a number of interesting settings, as follows.

- For arbitrary functions $f : \{0,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, where $\mathcal{S}$ contains all subsets of the domain, we show that no branch-and-bound algorithm can achieve $\gamma' \approx\gamma^{n/\log q}$, while a simple greedy algorithm achieves essentially $\gamma^{n/\log q}$.

- For a large class of MAX-CSPs, where $\mathcal{S} := \{ S_w\}$ contains each set of assignments to the variables induced by a partial assignment $w$, we show that no branch-and-bound algorithm can do significantly better than essentially a random guess, even for  $\gamma \approx 1+\sqrt{\log(q)/n}$.

- For the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), where $\mathcal{S} := \{S_p\}$ contains each set of tours extending a path $p$, we show that no branch-and-bound algorithm can achieve $\gamma' \approx (\gamma-1) n/\log q$. We also prove a nearly matching upper bound in our model. 

Behind these results is a "useless oracle lemma," which allows us to argue that under certain conditions the heuristic $h_f$ is "useless," and which might be of independent interest.

We also note two alternative interpretations of our model and results. If we interpret the heuristic $h_f$ as an oracle for an approximate decision problem, then our results unconditionally rule out a large and natural class of approximate search-to-decision reductions (which we think of as "branch-and-bound" search-to-decision reductions). We therefore show an oracle model in which approximate search and decision are strongly separated. (In particular, our lower bound for TSP can be viewed as a negative answer to a question posed by Bellare and Goldwasser (SIAM J. Comput. 1994), though only in an oracle model.) By instead interpreting $h_f$ as a data structure, we see that our results unconditionally rule out black-box search-to-decision reductions for data structures.</div>

<p>Though a multifaceted and complex discipline, Statistics’ greatest contribution is a rigorous framework for summarization. Statistics gives us reasonable procedures to estimate properties of a general population by examining only a few individuals from the population. In this regard, statistics is algorithmic: it provides randomized algorithms for extrapolation. In this blog, I’ll review some elementary stats (with as little mathematical formalism as possible), and try to crystalize why this algorithmic view is illuminating. In future blogs, I’ll build upon this algorithm perspective in applying it to more interesting examples in experiment design and prediction.</p>

<p>For a simple starter example, we know that every person on Earth has a height, defined as the distance from the bottom of their feet to the top of their head when standing upright. Suppose we would like to know the mean of the height of all living people. This would require us tracking down every living individual, getting out a tape measure, and measuring the distance from the bottom of their feet to the top of their head. To avoid such exhaustive counting we could instead devise an efficient algorithm to estimate this quantity. What if we selected a subset at random, and used this subset to estimate the mean? That is, we could collect a random sample of individuals from the population and measure the average height of all of the individuals in the sample.</p>

<p>The average height measured on this random sample is a random quantity. Thus it must have a mean and variance like we associate with other random quantities. If we were to sample each individual uniformly at random from all living humans, the expected mean height of the sample would be precisely the average height in the general population. Moreover, the variance of the average height of the sample will shrink proportionally to the number of sampled individuals. The more individuals you measure, the closer the average height on the sample will be to the average over the population.</p>

<p>Statistics provides powerful formulas that let us precisely quantify how close the sample average will be to the population average. For instance, we know a person’s height is a positive number and that there are no people who are taller than nine feet. With these two facts, a simple application of a formula called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoeffding%27s_inequality"><em>Hoeffding’s inequality</em></a> tells us that if we sample the heights of thirty thousand individuals, our sample average will be within an inch of the true average height with probability at least 83%. This assertion is true no matter how large the population of individuals. The required sample size is dictated only by the variability of height, not by the number of total individuals.</p>

<p>You could replace “height” in this example with almost any attribute that you are able to measure well. For quantities with reasonable variability, a uniform sample from a general population will give a high quality estimate of the average value. Statistics provides a powerful framework to reason about population-level properties by examining properties of small subsets.</p>

<p>In this example, statistics provided an algorithm for estimation. We began with a quantity whose average value we would like to estimate. We specified how much this quantity can vary in the population under study. Using formulas from statistics, we computed the number of individuals we needed to examine in order to have an estimate of appropriate quality. We then can proceed to do our best to extract a random sample of individuals of this size from the population, measure these individuals, and report the mean of the sample. This is a full procedure for estimating the mean value of the general population.</p>

<p>This algorithmic description of statistical summarization probably seems uncontroversial, but it differs from how statistics is often taught or conceptualized. As I’ve discussed in <a href="https://www.argmin.net/2021/09/13/effect-size/">previous</a> <a href="https://www.argmin.net/2021/09/21/models-are-wrong/">blogs</a>, the statistical model is oftentimes given highest precedence. In this model-based framing of statistics, the world is governed by probabilistic rules. With enough effort, these rules can be specified by a generative statistical model, and we assume that measurement is equivalent to sampling from this generative model. The generative model will have properties like a mean, and the law-of-large numbers will tell us that if we sample enough times from the model, we can accurately estimate the mean and other properties.</p>

<p>This distinction between modeling the sampling and modeling the population may appear to be splitting hairs. In some sense, the two viewpoints only differ conceptually as the algorithms for estimating the mean height in a population will be identical. However, our interpretation of these two views is different: in the algorithmic view, one can use statistics to understand the physical world no matter how the general population arose. As our height example highlights, only the most minimal modeling assumptions are needed to make use of statistical methods. In the modeling view, we shoehorn ourselves into modeling all processes with probability distributions. Not only is this unnecessary, but validating probabilistic models is also quite difficult. As I described in my last two blog posts (<a href="https://www.argmin.net/2021/09/13/effect-size/">1</a>) (<a href="https://www.argmin.net/2021/09/21/models-are-wrong/">2</a>), proposed statistical models are never validated in the vast majority of scientific studies.</p>

<p>The algorithmic view of statistics moreover illuminates the aspects of randomness that we have under our control. For example, there are whole branches of computer science dedicated to deterministically generating numbers that look random for all intents and purposes. Random number generation is something we can control. We can focus on understanding how our measurements fail to be ideal, rather than focusing on how the natural world doesn’t obey our models. This empowers the statistical practitioner to tune their procedures to be more robust against the limitations of what that can measure.</p>

<p>I want to once more emphasize that the algorithmic perspective I’ve presented here is not novel at all. Thinking about the combinatorics of random permutations and how they could be used to design randomized experiments is nearly one hundred years old, and, for example, prevalent in the works of <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2342192">Jerzy Neyman</a> and the eccentric eugenicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Experiments">Ronald Fisher</a> by the 1930s. Fisher’s rambling discursion on the woman who can tell if milk was added to a cup before tea describes a randomization procedure that does not model the appearance of tea in cups, the composition of tea cups, nor the psychic abilities of the tea expert. It purely counts permutations and uses exact statistics to provide a way to evaluate validity of a claim. I’ll review in more detail how to use these effectively <em>model-free</em> ideas for experimentation in the next post.</p>

<p>There are obviously issues with the algorithmic view. Statistical sampling methods work best when the variability of the quantity of interest is low. In such a case, small experiments quickly reveal insights about the population. When variances are large or effectively unbounded, the number of samples required for high precision estimates might be impractical and our estimators and algorithms need to be rethought. There are many phenomena that obey “power law” scaling, and such quantities are harder to work with in this rudimentary experimental framework. The uniform sampling algorithm we have described will have unbounded variance, and hence the average on the sample will no longer be an accurate measure of the average of the population. More sophisticated means must be deployed to estimate means of quantities with such high variation.</p>

<p>Another drawback of statistical sampling is the requirement that samples be sampled uniformly. Uniform sampling is an idealization and is often hard to implement in practice. For example, what does it mean to collect an i.i.d. sampling of registered voters in a poll? Some voters may not respond to your phone calls. Even more problematic is when you cannot define the population well in advance, as would be the case of the vague notion of “likely” voters. More sophisticated statistical analyses can provide guarantees on non-uniform sampling strategies, but care must be taken to ensure that the statistical bounds we compute reflect the reality of the implementation of the data collection. Understanding our sampling capabilities is crucial to understanding the validity of our estimates.</p>

<p>With these caveats in mind, our algorithmic framing of statistics gives us a focused way to think about experiment design and prediction methods. In the next blogs, I’ll explore these both in depth.</p></div>

<p>While every statistics course leads with how correlation does not imply causation, the methodological jump from observation to causal inference is small. Using the same algorithmic summarization and statistical analysis tools that we use to estimate averages, we can construct a reliable algorithm for evaluating the causal effect of interventions—actions that change the fate of individuals in a population. The crucial addition needed to evaluate cause and effect is the ability to intervene itself.</p>

<p>Let’s say that we have devised some intervention that can be applied to any individual in a population. We’d like to evaluate the impact of the intervention on the broader population by testing it on a small subset of individuals. As an example following on from the <a href="https://www.argmin.net/2021/09/28/summarization/">last post</a>, the reader can think of height as the property we’d like to affect, and milk consumption as the treatment. We cannot apply the treatment to every individual or else we’d never be able to disentangle whether the treatment caused the outcome or not. The solution is to restrict our attention to a subset of the population, and leverage randomized assignment to eliminate confounding effects.</p>

<p>The simplest mathematical formulation of experiment design often referred to in terms of <em>potential outcomes</em> and was originally conceived by <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2245382">Jerzy Neyman</a> (a character who will likely appear in every blog post in this series). Suppose if we apply a treatment to an individual, the quantity of interest takes value $A$. If we don’t apply the treatment, the quantity of interest is equal to $B$. Then we can define a quantity $Y$ which is equal to $A$ if the treatment is applied and equal to $B$ if the treatment is not applied. $Y$ is a deterministic quantity like height. However, there is an odd conditional effect: the value of $Y$ changes depending on whether we applied the treatment or not.</p>

<p>As a simple example, let $A$ denote the height of a person at age 18 if they drank milk growing up and $B$ denote their height if they did not drink milk. Now, obviously, one person can only take one of these paths! But we can imagine the two alternate realities where the same child either drank a cup of milk a day or drank a cup of water instead. The goal of an experimenter is to determine what would happen to a general individual had they taken either of the two paths in the road. The two potential outcomes here are the outcome if the treatment is applied and the outcome if the treatment is not applied.</p>

<p>While the potential outcomes formulation is tautological, it lets us apply the same ideas and statistics we used for computing the mean to the problem of estimating more complex treatment effects. For any individual, the treatment effect is a relation between the quantities A and B, commonly just the difference $A-B$. If the difference is positive, we see that applying the treatment increases the outcome variable for this individual. If a child drank a lot of milk, perhaps they are taller as an adult than if they only drank water. But, as we’ve discussed, our main hitch is that we can never simultaneously observe $A$ and $B$: once we choose whether to apply the treatment or not, we can only measure the corresponding treated or untreated condition.</p>

<p>This is where statistics can enter. Statistical algorithms can be applied to estimate <em>average</em> treatment effects across the general population. We can examine trends in small groups of individuals and extrapolate the insights to the broader population.</p>

<p>For such extrapolation, there are a variety of conventions for defining population level treatment effects. For example, we can define the <em>average treatment effect</em> to be the difference between the mean of $A$ and the mean of $B$. For those more comfortable seeing this written out as a formula, we can write</p>

\[\small{
\text{Average Treatment Effect} = \text{mean}(A)-\text{mean}(B)}\]

<p>In our milk example, this would be the difference in the mean of the population height if everyone drank milk versus no one drank milk.</p>

<p>Other population level quantities of interest arise when $A$ and $B$ represent binary outcomes. This could be, say, whether a person is over six feet tall as an adult. Or, for a more salient contemporary example, this could be whether a patient catches a disease or not in a vaccine study. In this case, $A$ is whether the patient catches the disease after receiving a vaccine and $B$ is whether the patient catches the disease after receiving a placebo.</p>

<p>The odds that an individual catches the disease is the number of people who catch the disease divided by the number who do not. The odds ratio for a treatment is the odds when every person receives the vaccine divided by the odds when no one receives the vaccine. We can write this out as a formula in terms of our quantities $A$ and $B$: when $A$ and $B$ can only take values 0 or 1, $\text{mean}(A)$ is the number of individuals for which $A=1$ divided by the total number of individuals. Hence, we can write the odds ratio as</p>

\[\small{
\text{Odds Ratio} = \frac{\text{mean}(A)}{1-\text{mean}(A)} \cdot \frac{ 1-\text{mean}(B)}{\text{mean}(B)}}\]

<p>This measures the decrease (or increase!) of the odds of a bad event happening when the treatment is applied. When the odds ratio is less than 1, the odds of a bad event are lower if the treatment is applied. When the odds ratio is greater than 1, the odds of a bad event are higher if the treatment is applied.</p>

<p>Similarly, the risk that an individual catches the disease is the ratio of the number of people who catch the disease to the total population size. Risk and odds are similar quantities, but some disciplines prefer one to the other by convention. The risk ratio is the fraction of bad events when a treatment is applied divided by the fraction of bad events when not applied. Again, in a formula,</p>

\[\small{
  \text{Risk Ratio} = \frac{\text{mean}(A)}{\text{mean}(B)}}\]

<p>The risk ratio measures the increase or decrease of relative risk of a bad event when the treatment is applied. In the recent context of vaccines, this ratio is popularly reported differently. The effectiveness of a treatment is one minus the risk ratio.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.argmin.net/2021/09/13/effect-size/">This is precisely the number used when people say a vaccine is 95% effective.</a> It is equivalent to saying that the proportion of those treated who fell ill was 20 times less than the proportion of those not treated who fell ill. Importantly, it does not mean that one has a 5% chance of contracting the disease.</p>

<p>Randomized algorithms give us cut and dry techniques to construct high accuracy estimators of population-level effects. Specifically, we can frame the estimation of the various measures of treatment effects as a particular statistical sampling strategy.</p>

<p>Think of the potential outcomes framework as doubling the size of the population. Each individual has an outcome under treatment and not under treatment. Hence, if we randomly select a sample and then randomly assign a treatment to each individual of the sample, we can compute the mean values of all subjects assigned to the treatment and all patients assigned to control. As long as $A$ and $B$ are bounded, such means of our samples are reasonable estimates of all of the treatment effects provided the number of samples is large enough.</p>

<p>The two stage process of building a sample and then randomizing assignment is equivalent to computing a random sample of the potential outcomes population. Randomized assignment allows us to probe population level effects without observing both outcomes of each individual. It’s an algorithmic strategy to extract information: Experiments are algorithms.</p>

<p>Just like in the <a href="https://www.argmin.net/2021/09/28/summarization/">last post</a>, this sampling method does not assume anything about the randomness of A and B. This randomized experiment design assumes that we can select samples at random from the population and assign treatments at random. But the individual treatment effects can be either deterministic or random. We do not need a probabilistic view of the universe in order to take advantage of the power of randomized experiments and prediction. Statistics still serve as a way to reason about the proportion of beneficial and adverse effects of interventions.</p>

<p>Moreover, elementary statistics allows us to quantify how confident we should be in the point estimate generated by our experiment with very little knowledge about the processes behind A and B. If the outcomes are binary, we can compute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval">exact confidence intervals</a> for our outcomes, regardless of how they are distributed. For example, returning to my favorite example of the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577">Pfizer vaccine trial</a>, the confidence intervals used were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Clopper%E2%80%93Pearson_interval">Clopper-Pearson intervals</a>, which are directly derived from the binomial distribution. The effect size was so large that simple statistics revealed an impressively large effect.</p>

<p>There are certainly limitations with the randomized experiment paradigm. Reliability estimating treatment effects needs the variability of the outcomes to be low, average effects may hide important variation across the population, and temporal dynamics and feedback effects can impact causal conclusions. In future posts, I’ll dive into these critiques in more detail.</p>

<p>Despite the potential limitations, it’s remarkable how causal effects can be measured with some rudimentary sampling and statistics. The same ideas used to estimate a mean can immediately be applied to estimate average effects of interventions. In both cases, we needed only modest knowledge of the effects under study to design algorithmic measures and to establish confidence intervals on their outcomes. In the next post, we’ll explore whether a similar program can be applied to the art of prediction and machine learning. (Spoiler alert: it’s complicated!)</p>

<p>Finally, I have to discuss an elephant I’ve left in the room. Determining cause and effect becomes impossibly challenging once we <em>can’t</em> intervene. For example, suppose we are trying to understand the effectiveness of a vaccine outside a well controlled clinical trial. In the wild, we have no control over who takes the vaccine, but instead can sample from a general population where a vaccine is available and count the number of people who got sick. Determining cause and effect from such <em>observational data</em> requires more modeling, knowledge, and statistical machinery. And no matter how sophisticated the analysis, arguments about hidden confounding variables and other counterfactuals are inevitable. Whenever naysayers are yelling how correlation doesn’t imply causation, it’s always targeting an observational study rather than a randomized controlled trial. For a comprehensive introduction to the deep complexity of this topic, let me shamelessly plug the causality chapter in <a href="http://mlstory.org"><em>Patterns, Predictions, and Actions</em></a>, which features both my favorite introduction to observational causal inference penned by Moritz and a version of this blog on experiments.</p></div>

Assume that $X_0,X_1$ (respectively $Y_0,Y_1$) are $d_X$ (respectively $d_Y$) indistinguishable for circuits of a given size. It is well known that the product distributions $X_0Y_0,\,X_1Y_1$ are $d_X+d_Y$ indistinguishable for slightly smaller circuits. However, in probability theory where unbounded adversaries are considered through statistical distance, it is folklore knowledge that in fact $X_0Y_0$ and $X_1Y_1$ are $d_X+d_Y-d_X\cdot d_Y$ indistinguishable, and also that this bound is tight.

We formulate and prove the computational analog of this tight bound. Our proof is entirely different from the proof in the statistical case, which is non-constructive. As a corollary, we show that if $X$ and $Y$ are $d$ indistinguishable, then $k$ independent copies of $X$ and $k$ independent copies of $Y$ are almost $1-(1-d)^k$ indistinguishable for smaller circuits, as against $d\cdot k$ using the looser bound. Our bounds are useful in settings where only weak (i.e. non-negligible) indistinguishability is guaranteed. We demonstrate this in the context of cryptography, showing that our bounds yield simple analysis for amplification of weak oblivious transfer protocols.</div>
