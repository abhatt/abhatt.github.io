Matching decision problem, as a multilinear polynomial over the Reals. We show
that in this polynomial, both the number of monomials and the magnitude of
their coefficients are at most exponential in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$. As an
application, we obtain a new upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(n^{1.5} \sqrt{\log
n})$ on the approximate degree of the bipartite perfect matching function,
improving the previous best known bound of $\mathcal{O}(n^{1.75})$. We deduce
that, beyond a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\log n})$ factor, the polynomial method
cannot be used to improve the lower bound on the bounded-error quantum query
complexity of bipartite perfect matching.

stochastic rewards problem, that is, the one sided online bipartite matching
problem where edges adjacent to an online node must be probed to determine if
they exist, based on known edge probabilities. If a probed edge exists, it must
be used in the matching (if possible). We consider the competitiveness of
online algorithms in four different models. Namely, we consider the following
stochastic reward problems: when the stochastic graph is not known and the
order of online arrivals is determined uniformly at random (i.e., the ROM
model); when the stochastic graph is known to the algorithm and the order of
arrival of online vertices is determined adversarially; when the stochastic
graph is known and the order of arrival of online vertices is determined
uniformly at random; and finally when the online vertices are generated i.i.d.
from a known distribution on the vertices of a known stochastic (type) graph.
In all these settings, the algorithm does not have any control on the ordering
of the online nodes. We study these models under various assumptions on the
patience (number of given probes) of the online vertices, and whether edges or
offline vertices are weighted in determining the stochastic reward. Our main
contribution is to establish new and improved competitive bounds in these four

<p>In all settings, there is one ideal benchmark (the optimal offline probing
algorithm) relative to which the competitive ratio is defined. For establishing
competitive ratios we introduce a new LP relaxation which upper bounds the
performance of the ideal benchmark.

homology, has been generalized to measure the distance between functors modeled
on many posets or even small categories. Existing theories require that such a
poset have a superlinear family of translations or a similar structure.
However, many posets of interest to topological data analysis, such as zig-zag
posets and the face relation poset of a cell-complex, do not admit interesting
translations, and consequently don't admit a nice theory of interleavings. In
this paper we show how one can side-step this limitation by providing a general
theory where one maps to a poset that does admit interesting translations, such
as the lattice of down sets, and then defines interleavings relative to this
map. Part of our theory includes a rigorous notion of discretization or
"pixelization" of poset modules, which in turn we use for interleaving
inference. We provide an approximation condition that in the setting of
lattices gives rise to two possible pixelizations, both of which are guaranteed
to be close in the interleaving distance. Finally, we conclude by considering
interleaving inference for cosheaves over a metric space and give an explicit
description of interleavings over a grid structure on Euclidean space.

optimization: the goal is to connect a set $T$ of terminals in a graph $G$ by a
tree of minimum size. Karpinski and Zelikovsky (1996) studied the
$\delta$-dense version of {\sc Steiner Tree}, where each terminal has at least
$\delta |V(G)\setminus T|$ neighbours outside $T$, for a fixed $\delta &gt; 0$.
They gave a PTAS for this problem.
</p>
<p>We study a generalization of pairwise $\delta$-dense {\sc Steiner Forest},

set $T_1,\dots,T_k$ are connected, and every terminal in $T_i$ has at least
$\delta |T_j|$ neighbours in $T_j$, and at least $\delta|S|$ nodes in $S =

algorithm for $\delta = 1/2$ and any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. We also consider the
$\delta$-dense Group Steiner Tree problem as defined by Hauptmann and show that
the problem is $\mathsf{APX}$-hard.

of two Boolean matrices (MW for short) has a number of important applications,
in particular the all-pairs lowest common ancestor (LCA) problem in directed
acyclic graphs (dags). The best known upper time-bound on the MW problem for
n\times n Boolean matrices of the form O(n^{2.575}) has not been substantially
improved since 2006. In order to obtain faster algorithms for this problem, we
study quantum algorithms for MW and approximation algorithms for MW (in the
standard computational model). Some of our quantum algorithms are input or
output sensitive. Our fastest quantum algorithm for the MW problem, and
consequently for the related problems, runs in time
\tilde{O}(n^{2+\lambda/2})=\tilde{O}(n^{2.434}), where \lambda satisfies the
equation \omega(1, \lambda, 1) = 1 + 1.5 \, \lambda and \omega(1, \lambda, 1)
is the exponent of the multiplication of an n \times n^{\lambda}$ matrix by an
n^{\lambda} \times n matrix. Next, we consider a relaxed version of the MW
problem (in the standard model) asking for reporting a witness of bounded rank
(the maximum witness has rank 1) for each non-zero entry of the matrix product.
By reducing the relaxed problem to the so called k-witness problem, we provide
an algorithm that reports for each non-zero entry C[i,j] of the product matrix
C a witness of rank O(\lceil W_C(i,j)/k\rceil ), where W_C(i,j) is the number
of witnesses for C[i,j], with high probability. The algorithm runs in
\tilde{O}(n^{\omega}k^{0.4653} +n^2k) time, where \omega=\omega(1,1,1).

compute a set $S \subset V$ of cardinality $\left\lvert S\right\rvert \leq k$
such that the weight of edges inside $S$ is maximized. This is a fundamental
NP-hard problem whose approximability, inspite of many decades of research, is
yet to be settled. The current best known approximation algorithm due to
Bhaskara et al. (2010) computes a $\mathcal{O}\left({n^{1/4 +
\epsilon}}\right)$ approximation in time
$n^{\mathcal{O}\left(1/\epsilon\right)}$.
</p>
<p>We ask what are some "easier" instances of this problem? We propose some
natural semi-random models of instances with a planted dense subgraph, and
study approximation algorithms for computing the densest subgraph in them.
These models are inspired by the semi-random models of instances studied for
various other graph problems such as the independent set problem, graph
partitioning problems etc. For a large range of parameters of these models, we
get significantly better approximation factors for the Densest $k$-subgraph
problem. Moreover, our algorithm recovers a large part of the planted solution.

rules in the literature of multi-winner elections. The problem of determining
if there exists a committee of size k that has a Chamberlin-Courant
(respectively, Monroe) score of at most r is known to be NP-complete. We
consider the following natural problems in this setting: a) given a committee S
of size k as input, is it an optimal k-sized committee, and b) given a
candidate c and a committee size k, does there exist an optimal k-sized
committee that contains c?
</p>
<p>In this work, we resolve the complexity of both problems for the
Chamberlin-Courant and Monroe voting rules in the settings of rankings as well
as approval ballots. We show that verifying if a given committee is optimal is
coNP-complete whilst the latter problem is complete for $\Theta_{2}^{P}$. We
also demonstrate efficient algorithms for the second problem when the input
consists of single-peaked rankings. Our contribution fills an essential gap in
the literature for these important multi-winner rules.

constraints on a set of identical machines to minimize the makespan objective
function. Understanding the exact approximability of the problem when the
number of machines is a constant is a well-known question in scheduling theory.
Indeed, an outstanding open problem from the classic book of Garey and Johnson
asks whether this problem is NP-hard even in the case of 3 machines and
unit-length jobs. In a recent breakthrough, Levey and Rothvoss gave a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, which runs in nearly quasi-polynomial
time, for the case when job have unit lengths. However, a substantially more
difficult case where jobs have arbitrary processing lengths has remained open.
</p>
<p>We make progress on this more general problem. We show that there exists a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm (with similar running time as that of
Levey and Rothvoss) for the non-migratory setting: when every job has to be
scheduled entirely on a single machine, but within a machine the job need not
be scheduled during consecutive time steps. Further, we also show that our
algorithmic framework generalizes to another classic scenario where, along with
the precedence constraints, the jobs also have communication delay constraints.
Both of these fundamental problems are highly relevant to the practice of
datacenter scheduling.

tasks, traditionally performed by employees or contractors, to a large group of
smart-phone users by means of an open call. With the increasing complexity of
the crowdsourcing applications, requesters find it essential to harness the
power of collaboration among the workers by forming teams of skilled workers
satisfying their complex tasks' requirements. This type of MCS is called
Collaborative MCS (CMCS). Previous CMCS approaches have mainly focused only on
the aspect of team skills maximization. Other team formation studies on social
networks (SNs) have only focused on social relationship maximization. In this
paper, we present a hybrid approach where requesters are able to hire a team
that, not only has the required expertise, but also is socially connected and
can accomplish tasks collaboratively. Because team formation in CMCS is proven
to be NP-hard, we develop a stochastic algorithm that exploit workers knowledge
about their SN neighbors and asks a designated leader to recruit a suitable
team. The proposed algorithm is inspired from the optimal stopping strategies
and uses the odds-algorithm to compute its output. Experimental results show
that, compared to the benchmark exponential optimal solution, the proposed
approach reduces computation time and produces reasonable performance results.

In its
most basic form the goal is to fit a degree $d$ polynomial to a response
variable $y$ in terms of an $n$-dimensional input vector $x$. This is extremely
well-studied with many applications and has sample and runtime complexity
$\Theta(n^d)$. Can one achieve better runtime if the intrinsic dimension of the
data is much smaller than the ambient dimension $n$? Concretely, we are given
samples $(x,y)$ where $y$ is a degree at most $d$ polynomial in an unknown
$r$-dimensional projection (the relevant dimensions) of $x$. This can be seen
both as a generalization of phase retrieval and as a special case of learning
multi-index models where the link function is an unknown low-degree polynomial.
Note that without distributional assumptions, this is at least as hard as junta
learning.
</p>
<p>In this work we consider the important case where the covariates are
Gaussian. We give an algorithm that learns the polynomial within accuracy
$\epsilon$ with sample complexity that is roughly $N = O_{r,d}(n
\log^2(1/\epsilon) (\log n)^d)$ and runtime $O_{r,d}(N n^2)$. Prior to our
work, no such results were known even for the case of $r=1$. We introduce a new
filtered PCA approach to get a warm start for the true subspace and use
geodesic SGD to boost to arbitrary accuracy; our techniques may be of
independent interest, especially for problems dealing with subspace recovery or
analyzing SGD on manifolds.

<div>I asked my Grad Ramsey Theory class to email me about whatever thoughts they have on the pandemic that they want to share with the world, with the intend of making some of them into a blog post. I thought there would be several short thoughts for one post. And I may still do that post. But I got a FANTASTIC long answer from one Emily Mae Kaplitz. Normally I would ask to shorten or edit a guest post, but I didn't do that here since that might make it less authentic.</div><div><br /></div><div>Here is Emily Kaplitz's email (with her enthusiastic permission)</div><div><br /></div><div>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br /></div><div>Ok so this might be super ranty, (It definitely is.) but I think it is super important to bring up in a blog post written by an academic that will be probably read by other academics. </div><div><br /></div><div>The students that are being most affected by this pandemic with online learning are disability students. As a disability student, we carefully cultivate the way that we learn best based off of years of trial and error. This is harder than anything else, we have to face in our lifetime. Most of the time disability students are left on the back burner and that statement is so much more prevalent right now. My friends brother is autistic. He is struggling so much right now because he is at home. Disability students learn what environment works best for them and at home is usually not the best place. We have to split our lives into different boxes that each have different tools to help us get our brains to focus and work well when we need them too. Disability students will rely on everything being planned out, so that they can succeed. Teachers and professors cannot understand the stress and strain that having to work at home puts on the student. Every time I go to another school, it is a struggle to figure out what new thing I need to add into the mix and what old thing I need to throw away. It's exhausting, but when I go from one school to another I at least know that the basics are the same. I sit in a classroom, the professors lecturer, and then I do work at home that is assigned to me. Changing to online changes that dynamic so much. A professor cannot see when a student is visibly struggling with a topic because we'll all behind computers. A neurotypical person might ask, "well why don't you just ask a question? Why don't you just let the professor know that you don't understand". Let me answer that simply. If all your life you've been silenced because of something that you cannot control, is your first reaction to speak out or to stay silent. It is so hard for disability students to ask a question after we've been labeled the dumb kid. Every time we ask a question, we always have the thought of: is this going to make me sound stupid. We've worked so hard to eliminate that word from our vocabulary and from others who will throw that word back at us. Disability students are being left in the hands of their parents and teachers/professors who do not understand us and our needs even if they try to or want to. It is so hard for us to explain what our normal is because we don't live your normal and therefore don't know the difference. Many disability students have their confidence slashed the moment they enter a classroom and realize that they are not like the other kids. Even more so because they don't understand why they aren't. Disability students are one of the most hard-working individuals when we have a cheerleader to cheer us on because it's hard. It's harder than anything anyone has to do. Because no one listens to you when you are stupid and no one cares for you if you're not easy to care for unless they are given a specific reason to. Fighting a losing battle every day is awful. Now imagine all of your weapons that you have carefully crafted over the years have been taken away and you are left defenseless. While we have things like ADS that are supposed to help support us, it's not enough. Just like putting a Band-Aid on an open infected wound will not be enough. Now more than ever we need to learn from this as academics. We need to learn that helping disability students does not only help disability students. It helps all students because all students learn differently. All students if given the chance can excel at any field that we put them in. We just have to figure out the best way to get that student to shine. That is one of the reasons why I am a PhD student right now. I saw in the tutoring center at my undergrad how many students came to me with so much frustration about something they are doing in class. Both students with disabilities and without. These students are constantly apologizing because they don't understand something. In one session by just changing the way that we talk about a subject the student was able to get it in less time than the professor taught it. I've had students come to me after an exam and tell me that the only reason they got the grade that they did was because in their head was my voice coaching them on a subject. We are not teaching optimally. We are teaching the way that it has been done for years and years and years and that is not the best way to teach. It might be the best way to teach the strongest links but really the link that matters the most is the weakest link that will snap under pressure because you can't pull a tractor with a broken link. Disability students think differently. Imagine how many impossible problems we can solve when we have people that think differently. But that's just my two cents as a disability student who is struggling and sees other disability students struggling every day. And really just wants to help all students succeed.</div><div><br /></div><div>I blame any misspellings, grammar errors, and run on sentences on my speech to text and text to speech. This was a long email and if we were on tumblr, I would post a potato at the end. Since we aren't, I will leave this email with this. Thank you for taking the time to read this rant. Even if you don't include this in your blog post, I believe one person reading this has made the difference.</div><div><br /></div><div>Thanks!</div><div><br /></div><div>Emily Mae Kaplitz</div></div>

For every constant c &gt; 0, we show that there is a family {P_{N,c}} of polynomials whose degree and algebraic circuit complexity are polynomially bounded in the number of variables, and that satisfies the following properties:
* For every family {f_n} of polynomials in VP, where f_n is an n variate polynomial of degree at most n^c with bounded integer coefficients and for N = \binom{n^c + n}{n}, P_{N,c} -vanishes- on the coefficient vector of f_n.
* There exists a family {h_n} of polynomials where h_n is an n variate polynomial of degree at most n^c with bounded integer coefficients such that for N = \binom{n^c + n}{n}, P_{N,c} -does not vanish- on the coefficient vector of h_n.

In other words, there are efficiently computable defining equations for polynomials in VP that have small integer coefficients.
In fact, we also prove an analogous statement for the seemingly larger class VNP. Thus, in this setting of polynomials with small integer coefficients, this provides evidence -against- a natural proof like barrier for proving algebraic circuit lower bounds, a framework for which was proposed in the works of Forbes, Shpilka and Volk (2018), and Grochow, Kumar, Saks and Saraf (2017).

Our proofs are elementary and rely on the existence of (non-explicit) hitting sets for VP (and VNP) to show that there are efficiently constructible, low degree defining equations for these classes, and also extend to finite fields of small size.</div>

Motivated by the question of data quantization and "binning," we revisit the problem of identity testing of discrete probability distributions. Identity testing (a.k.a. one-sample testing), a fundamental and by now well-understood problem in distribution testing, asks, given a reference distribution (model) $\mathbf{q}$ and samples from an unknown distribution $\mathbf{p}$, both over $[n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$, whether $\mathbf{p}$ equals $\mathbf{q}$, or is significantly different from it.

In this paper, we introduce the related question of identity up to binning, where the reference distribution $\mathbf{q}$ is over $k \ll n$ elements: the question is then whether there exists a suitable binning of the domain $[n]$ into $k$ intervals such that, once "binned," $\mathbf{p}$ is equal to $\mathbf{q}$. We provide nearly tight upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity of this new question, showing both a quantitative and qualitative difference with the vanilla identity testing one, and answering an open question of Canonne (2019). Finally, we discuss several extensions and related research directions.</div>

= (V, E)$, and a shortest paths tree $\widehat{K}$ rooted at a node $s$, and
the goal is to output for every node $t \in V$ and for every edge $e$ in
$\widehat{K}$ the length of the shortest path from $s$ to $t$ avoiding $e$.
</p>
<p>We present an $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n} + n^2)$ time randomized combinatorial
algorithm for unweighted directed graphs. Previously such a bound was known in
the directed case only for the seemingly easier problem of replacement path
where both the source and the target nodes are fixed.
</p>
<p>Our new upper bound for this problem matches the existing conditional
combinatorial lower bounds. Hence, (assuming these conditional lower bounds)
our result is essentially optimal and completes the picture of the SSRP problem
in the combinatorial setting.
</p>
<p>Our algorithm extends to the case of small, rational edge weights. We
strengthen the existing conditional lower bounds in this case by showing that
any $O(mn^{1/2-\epsilon})$ time (combinatorial or algebraic) algorithm for some
fixed $\epsilon &gt;0$ yields a truly subcubic algorithm for the weighted All
Pairs Shortest Paths problem (previously such a bound was known only for the
combinatorial setting).

Given a collection of preferences (rankings of a set of alternatives), we aim
at determining a connected graph G on which the preferences are single-peaked,
in the sense that all the preferences are traversals of G. Note that a
collection of preferences is always single-peaked on the complete graph. We
propose an Integer Linear Programming formulation (ILP) of the problem of
minimizing the number of edges in G or the maximum degree of a vertex in G. We
prove that both problems are NP-hard in the general case. However, we show that
if the optimal number of edges is m-1 (where m is the number of candidates)
then any optimal solution of the ILP is integer and thus the integrality
constraints can be relaxed. This provides an alternative proof of the
polynomial-time complexity of recognizing single-peaked preferences on a tree.
We prove the same result for the case of a path (an axis), providing here also
an alternative proof of polynomiality of the recognition problem. Furthermore,
we provide a polynomial-time procedure to recognize single-peaked preferences
on a pseudotree (a connected graph that contains at most one cycle). We also
give some experimental results, both on real and synthetic datasets.

spins from a finite set. The interactions between neighbouring spins give rise
to weights, so a spin assignment can also be viewed as a weighted graph
homomorphism. The problem of approximating the partition function (the
aggregate weight of spin assignments) or of sampling from the resulting
probability distribution is typically intractable for general graphs.
</p>
<p>In this work, we consider arbitrary spin systems on bipartite expander
$\Delta$-regular graphs, including the canonical class of bipartite random
$\Delta$-regular graphs. We develop fast approximate sampling and counting
algorithms for general spin systems whenever the degree and the spectral gap of
the graph are sufficiently large. Our approach generalises the techniques of
Jenseen et al. and Chen et al. by showing that typical configurations on
bipartite expanders correspond to "bicliques" of the spin system; then, using
suitable polymer models, we show how to sample such configurations and
approximate the partition function in $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ time, where $n$ is the
size of the graph.

time- and space-efficiency, while introducing a possibility of false positive
and false negative answers. Correctness proofs of such structures involve
subtle reasoning about bounds on probabilities of getting certain outcomes.
Because of these subtleties, a number of unsound arguments in such proofs have
been made over the years. In this work, we address the challenge of building
rigorous and reusable computer-assisted proofs about probabilistic
specifications of AMQs. We describe the framework for systematic decomposition
of AMQs and their properties into a series of interfaces and reusable
components. We implement our framework as a library in the Coq proof assistant
and showcase it by encoding in it a number of non-trivial AMQs, such as Bloom
filters, counting filters, quotient filters and blocked constructions, and
mechanising the proofs of their probabilistic specifications. We demonstrate
how AMQs encoded in our framework guarantee the absence of false negatives by
construction. We also show how the proofs about probabilities of false
positives for complex AMQs can be obtained by means of verified reduction to
the implementations of their simpler counterparts. Finally, we provide a
library of domain-specific theorems and tactics that allow a high degree of
automation in probabilistic proofs.

isomorphism problem}$ (denoted $\mathrm{SUB}(G)$) asks, given an $n$-vertex
graph $H$ and a coloring $V(H) \to V(G)$, whether $H$ contains a properly
colored copy of $G$. The complexity of this problem is tied to parameterized
versions of $\mathit{P}$ ${=}?$ $\mathit{NP}$ and $\mathit{L}$ ${=}?$
$\mathit{NL}$, among other questions. An overarching goal is to understand the
complexity of $\mathrm{SUB}(G)$, under different computational models, in terms
of natural invariants of the pattern graph $G$.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we establish a close relationship between the $\textit{formula
complexity}$ of $\mathrm{SUB}$ and an invariant known as $\textit{tree-depth}$
(denoted $\mathrm{td}(G)$). $\mathrm{SUB}(G)$ is known to be solvable by
monotone $\mathit{AC^0}$ formulas of size $O(n^{\mathrm{td}(G)})$. Our main
result is an $n^{\tilde\Omega(\mathrm{td}(G)^{1/3})}$ lower bound for formulas
that are monotone $\textit{or}$ have sub-logarithmic depth. This complements a
lower bound of Li, Razborov and Rossman (SICOMP 2017) relating tree-width and
$\mathit{AC^0}$ circuit size. As a corollary, it implies a stronger
homomorphism preservation theorem for first-order logic on finite structures
(Rossman, ITCS 2017).
</p>
<p>The technical core of this result is an $n^{\Omega(k)}$ lower bound in the
special case where $G$ is a complete binary tree of height $k$, which we
establish using the $\textit{pathset framework}$ introduced in (Rossman, SICOMP
2018). (The lower bound for general patterns follows via a recent
excluded-minor characterization of tree-depth (Czerwi\'nski et al,
<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1904.13077">arXiv:1904.13077</a>).) Additional results of this paper extend the pathset
framework and improve upon both, the best known upper and lower bounds on the
average-case formula size of $\mathrm{SUB}(G)$ when $G$ is a path.

quantum analogue of the Aanderaa-Karp-Rosenberg conjecture. We show that if $f$
is a nontrivial monotone graph property of an $n$-vertex graph specified by its
adjacency matrix, then $Q(f) = \Omega(n)$, which is also optimal.

outputs the result of the comparison. Problems like sorting and searching have
been studied in this model, and it has been generalized to include the concept
of priced information, where different pairs of items (say database records)
have different comparison costs. These comparison costs can be arbitrary (in
which case no algorithm can be close to optimal (Charikar et al. STOC 2000)),
structured (for example, the comparison cost may depend on the length of the
databases (Gupta et al. FOCS 2001)), or stochastic (Angelov et al. LATIN 2008).
Motivated by the database setting where the cost depends on the sizes of the
items, we consider the problems of sorting and batched predecessor where two
non-uniform sets of items $A$ and $B$ are given as input.
</p>
<p>(1) In the RAM setting, we consider the scenario where both sets have $n$
keys each. The cost to compare two items in $A$ is $a$, to compare an item of
$A$ to an item of $B$ is $b$, and to compare two items in $B$ is $c$. We give
upper and lower bounds for the case $a \le b \le c$. Notice that the case $b=1,
a=c=\infty$ is the famous ``nuts and bolts'' problem.
</p>
<p>(2) In the Disk-Access Model (DAM), where transferring elements between disk
and internal memory is the main bottleneck, we consider the scenario where
elements in $B$ are larger than elements in $A$. The larger items take more
I/Os to be brought into memory, consume more space in internal memory, and are
required in their entirety for comparisons.
</p>
<p>We first give output-sensitive lower and upper bounds on the batched
predecessor problem, and use these to derive bounds on the complexity of
sorting in the two models. Our bounds are tight in most cases, and require
novel generalizations of the classical lower bound techniques in external
memory to accommodate the non-uniformity of keys.

$k\times k$ submatrix of $A$ with the maximum determinant in absolute value.
This problem is motivated by the question of computing the determinant-based
lower bound of [LSV86] on hereditary discrepancy, which was later shown to be
an approximate upper bound as well [Mat13]. The special case where $k$
coincides with one of the dimensions of $A$ has been extensively studied.
[Nik15] gave a $2^{O(k)}$-approximation algorithm for this special case,
matching known lower bounds; he also raised as an open problem the question of
designing approximation algorithms for the general case.
</p>
<p>We make progress towards answering this question by giving the first
efficient approximation algorithm for general $k\times k$ subdeterminant
maximization with an approximation ratio that depends only on $k$. Our
algorithm finds a $k^{O(k)}$-approximate solution by performing a simple local
search. Our main technical contribution, enabling the analysis of the
approximation ratio, is an extension of Pl\"ucker relations for the
Grassmannian, which may be of independent interest; Pl\"ucker relations are
quadratic polynomial equations involving the set of $k\times k$ subdeterminants
of a $k\times n$ matrix. We find an extension of these relations to $k\times k$
subdeterminants of general $m\times n$ matrices.

<div class="content">
<p>The usual definition of a Euclidean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_center">triangle center</a> is a point defined from a triangle in a way that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivariant_map">equivariant</a> under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)">similarity transformations</a>, meaning that applying the transformation to a triangle and then constructing its center produces the same point as constructing the center first and then transforming it. These include familiar points defined from triangles like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthocenter">orthocenter</a> (where perpendiculars to the sides meet), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incenter">incenter</a> (the center of the inscribed circle), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcenter">circumcenter</a> (the center of the circumscribed circle). What I have in mind in this post is a similarly-defined concept, but with a different group of transformations than similarity: the combination of any two separate linear transformations to the two coordinate axes of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_plane">Cartesian plane</a>, or transformations that swap the (transformed) axes. Another way of describing these transformations is that they preserve axis-parallel lines and relative area. They also preserve other lines and parallelism of lines.</p>

<p>One of the standard Euclidean triangle centers turns out to be a Cartesian center as well: the centroid has as its coordinates the average of the three triangle vertex coordinates, and this coordinatewise calculation (independent of the ordering of the three vertices) shows it to be equivariant under Cartesian transformations. It is also the point where the three lines through each vertex and opposite side midpoint meet.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/centroid.svg" alt="Centroid of a triangle" /></p>

<p>Similarly, we can find a Cartesian triangle center from the coordinatewise median of the three vertices.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/median.svg" alt="Median of a triangle" /></p>

<p>The center of the axis-parallel bounding box is also a Cartesian triangle center, again computed coordinatewise as the average of the minimum and maximum coordinates.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/bbcenter.svg" alt="Bounding-box center of a triangle" /></p>

<p>But a Cartesian triangle center does not have to be determined coordinatewise in this way. As an example, denote the three triangle vertices by  and consider the point  with the property that the axis-parallel bounding boxes of the three line segments  all have equal area. For two points  and , the locus of points for which the two bounding boxes have equal area is a line through the other two corners of the bounding box of segment . (To see this, consider a linear transformation that takes this bounding box to a square, and apply symmetry.) The three lines defined in this way from the three pairs of vertices of a non-degenerate triangle always meet in a point, the center we are seeking. (This follows from the shared equality of the three rectangles, but it is also an instance of the dual of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappus%27s_hexagon_theorem">Pappus’s theorem</a>.) And this point is equivariant under Cartesian transformations because these transformations preserve the ratios of areas of bounding rectangles.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/equalbb.svg" alt="Point of equal bounding boxes of a triangle" /></p>

<p>You can tell it’s not a coordinatewise center because, in the figure above, the triangle vertices have equally spaced -coordinates, from which it follows that all coordinatewise centers lie on the horizontal line with median -coordinate, but this center doesn’t.</p>

<p>In general, the geometry of the plane with Cartesian instead of Euclidean transformations does not seem to have been very thoroughly explored. These examples show, I think, that there are interesting things to find there.</p>

<div class="content" lang="en">
<p>Yesterday the Italian prime minister announced the timeline of the loosening of the lockdown. Some manufacturing restarted yesterday, and some customer-facing businesses will gradually reopen between next Monday and the beginning of June.</p>
<p><span id="more-4369"></span></p>
<p>Since the start of the lockdown 51 days ago, it was clear that the condition to “reopen” was to have in place a “test-trace-isolate” plan to find infected people as soon as possible after their contagion, trace their contacts, and isolate them. For this, one needs an infrastructure for large-scale testing with quick turnaround, a well-staffed agency to do manual tracing or an app to do it automatically, and facilities to isolate people who are infected and not in need of hospitalization.</p>
<p>None of this has been done. There hasn’t been a sufficient ramp-up of testing capacity; as far as I know no additional people have been hired and trained for manual contact-tracing; there is an app for digital contact-tracing, but the plan to adopt it appears to have been shelved; if people test positive and are well they are asked to stay home, potentially with their family members, who are free to leave as they please.</p>
<p>All our eggs are in the basket of social distancing. The humor site Kotiomkin posted “Basically, phase 2 will rely on everybody’s common sense. We are fucked”.</p>
<p>The problem is that social distancing requires a common-sense avoidance of close contacts with other people, and the government can give guidelines on how to achieve it, but eventually it has to rely on everybody’s sense of responsibility. Unfortunately, the national mood around regulations is to immediately look for loopholes. </p>
<p>For example the initial lockdown measures stipulated that one could leave home to go buy groceries. Then when the police would stop people tens of miles away from their home, people would say “I drove here to buy groceries”, “but we are thirty miles away from where you live”, “yes but here the groceries are better”. So a subsequent amendment stipulated that one could buy groceries only in the town of residence, making it hard for people living next to a town border, for whom the closest grocery store was across the town line. In fact, every time I have encountered a crazy Italian law or regulation, and asked around for the likely reason it was instituted, it was usually to close a loophole in a previous regulation, which in turn had been put in place to close a loophole in a third regulation, and basically it’s loophole-closing all the way down to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_law">Roman law</a>.</p>
<p>I think that, from this point on, the story of the Italian covid-19 epidemic will not show the future of the rest of the Western world, but will evolve in its own timeline. Meanwhile, there are a couple of lessons that are still relevant, particularly in the comparison between Lombardy and NYC, which continue to track each other remarkably well.</p>
<p><img src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/2020-05-28-nyc-daily.png?w=584" alt="2020-05-28-nyc-daily" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4375" /><img src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/2020-05-28-nyc.png?w=584" alt="2020-05-28-nyc" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4376" /></p>
<p>One is that, at one point, it was decided to move older people with mild cases of covid-19 from hospital to nursing homes, to open up beds in hospitals. Since the personnel of nursing homes are not trained in the safety procedures for infectious diseases, and since nursing homes host older, frail people who are the highest-risk category for this illness, the result was a huge number of deaths in these nursing homes. Now nursing homes in New York are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/nursing-homes-coronavirus.html">being asked to take covid-19 patients from hospitals</a>.</p>
<p>The other is that an analysis of all-cause mortality shows a spike in March such that the difference between the typical March all-cause mortality and the March 2020 all-cause mortality is much bigger than the number of confirmed covid-19 deaths. Now the same phenomenon is being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/27/upshot/coronavirus-deaths-new-york-city.html"> observed in New York City</a>, with numbers similar to Lombardy’s. Notably, the baseline all-case mortality rate in Lombardy is much higher than in New York City (because  population growth has stalled and the demographic skews older), so while the absolute number of additional deaths is similar, the relative increase is a much more dramatic 6x in NYC versus roughly 4x in Lombardy. </p></div>

For a fixed "pattern" graph $G$, the $\textit{colored}$ $G\textit{-subgraph isomorphism problem}$ (denoted $\mathrm{SUB}(G)$) asks, given an $n$-vertex graph $H$ and a coloring $V(H) \to V(G)$, whether $H$ contains a properly colored copy of $G$. The complexity of this problem is tied to parameterized versions of $\mathit{P}$ ${=}?$ $\mathit{NP}$ and $\mathit{L}$ ${=}?$ $\mathit{NL}$, among other questions. An overarching goal is to understand the complexity of $\mathrm{SUB}(G)$, under different computational models, in terms of natural invariants of the pattern graph $G$.

In this paper, we establish a close relationship between the $\textit{formula complexity}$ of $\mathrm{SUB}$ and an invariant known as $\textit{tree-depth}$ (denoted $\mathrm{td}(G)$). $\mathrm{SUB}(G)$ is known to be solvable by monotone $\mathit{AC^0}$ formulas of size $O(n^{\mathrm{td}(G)})$. Our main result is an $n^{\tilde\Omega(\mathrm{td}(G)^{1/3})}$ lower bound for formulas that are monotone $\textit{or}$ have sub-logarithmic depth. This complements a lower bound of Li, Razborov and Rossman (SICOMP 2017) relating tree-width and $\mathit{AC^0}$ circuit size. As a corollary, it implies a stronger homomorphism preservation theorem for first-order logic on finite structures (Rossman, ITCS 2017).

The technical core of this result is an $n^{\Omega(k)}$ lower bound in the special case where $G$ is a complete binary tree of height $k$, which we establish using the $\textit{pathset framework}$ introduced in (Rossman, SICOMP 2018). (The lower bound for general patterns follows via a recent excluded-minor characterization of tree-depth (Czerwi\'nski et al, arXiv:1904.13077).) Additional results of this paper extend the pathset framework and improve upon both, the best known upper and lower bounds on the average-case formula size of $\mathrm{SUB}(G)$ when $G$ is a path.</div>

<p>(I am now on <a href="https://twitter.com/boazbaraktcs">Twitter</a> ,  so you can follow this blog there too if you prefer it. –Boaz)</p>



<p>Between Zoom meetings and deadlines, I thought I’d jot down a few of my impressions so far on what lessons we can draw from this period on how well research and education can work online.  I’ve had a few surprises in both directions – things that worked better than I would have expected, and aspects that were more problematic than I realized. These are personal impressions – please do comment on your own experiences.</p>



<p>As a rule of thumb, the interactions that most successfully replicate online are those that are relatively short and focused (an hour or so – e.g., a focused research meeting, seminar talk, or a lecture in a course).  Other interactions (e.g., faculty meetings) are also fairly easily to port online, perhaps because the original wasn’t that great to begin with.</p>



<p>The things that are harder to replicate are sustained interactions over longer periods. These include more extended and less directed research collaborations, informal workshops, as well as support for students outside lectures in education.</p>



<p><strong>Works well: Research seminars</strong></p>



<p>I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how effective research seminars such as our <a href="https://mltheory.org/">machine learning theory seminar</a> are over Zoom. In particular these were no less interactive than physical seminars – in fact people are offten <em>more</em> comfortable asking questions on chat than they would during in-person seminars. I hope such seminars become common practice even after this period ends- flying a speaker across the country or the world to give an hour talk doesn’t makes much sense given that there is a perfectly satisfactory alternative. </p>



<p><strong>Works well: Lectures</strong></p>



<p>This term I am teaching <a href="https://cs127.boazbarak.org/schedule/">cryptography</a>, and online lectures on Zoom have gone surprisingly well (after  working out some <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2020/03/26/technology-for-theory-covid-19-edition/">technical issues</a>). Students participate on chat and ask questions, and seem to be following the lecture quite well. The important caveat is that lectures only work well for the students that attend and can follow them. For students who need extra support, it’s become much harder to access it.  It’s also much easier for students to (literally) “fall off the screen” and fall behind in a course, which brings me to the next point.</p>



<p><strong>Works less well: Support outside lectures</strong></p>



<p>Lectures are just one component of a course. Most of students’ learning occurs outside the classroom, where students meet together and work on problem sets, or discuss course material. These interactions between students (both related and unrelated to course) are where much of their intellectual growth happens. </p>



<p>All these interactions are greatly diminished online, and I did not yet see a good alternative. I’ve seen reduced attendance in office hours and sections, and reports are that students find it much harder to have the sort of chance discussions and opportunities to find study partners that they value so much.  If anything, this experience had made me <em>less</em> positive about the possibility of online education replacing physical colleges (though there are interesting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva_Schools_at_KGI">hybrid models</a>, where the students are co-located but lecturers are online).</p>



<p><strong>Works less well: unstructured research collaborations</strong></p>



<p>A focused meeting reporting on results or deciding on work allocation works pretty well over Zoom. So far it seems that extended brainstorming meetings, such as talking to someone over several hours in a coffeeshop, are much harder to replicate. In particular, a good part of such meetings is often spent with people staring in silence into their notebooks. As I <a href="https://twitter.com/boazbaraktcs/status/1253330145789673473">wrote</a>,  mutual silence seems to be very hard to do over Zoom.</p>



<p>Generally, informal week-long workshops, where much time is devoted to unstructured discussions, are ones that are most important to hold in person, and are hard (or maybe impossible) to replicate online. I have still not attended an online conference, but I suspect that these aspects of the conference would also be the ones hardest to replicate.</p>



<p><strong>Works well: faculty meetings</strong></p>



<p>I’ve always found it hard to bring a laptop to a faculty meeting and get work done, while listening with one ear to what’s going on. This is so much easier over Zoom <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt="🙂" /></p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en">
<p>Last quarter, I taught <a href="https://omereingold.wordpress.com/cs-353-the-practice-of-theory-research/">a course on research methods</a> in TOC, which gave me an opportunity to think through many aspects of research. I was promoting a human-centric perspective on research: how to facilitate better research by addressing the conditions needed for an individual researcher and groups of researchers to succeed. As science is a communal effort, the communication of science is critical, and thus one of the topics we covered is oral presentations.</p>
<p>There are plenty of resources about research talks, and mostly they emphasize form over matter. How many words in a slide? How many slides in a talk? how to and how not to use font colors? How to and how not to use animation? and so on. While all of these are important, I find that the failing of many research talks is on a much more basic level.</p>
<p>Think back to a research talk you heard recently, or to one you heard a few months ago. You may remember how you felt and what you thought of the talk but what do you remember of this talk in terms of content? Most of us will find that we don’t remember much, I rarely do. Yet in our presentations, we often follow a research-paper-like mold and squeeze in many little details that are somehow important to us, forgetting that they will all vanish in our audience’s memory soon after (or completely missed in the first place). Giving a talk (writing a paper, writing a blog post etc.) is about communication: who is your audience? what are the limitation of the medium? what is the message you want to convey? Since so little stays with the audience long term, it makes sense to make sure that this little will be what seems most important for you to convey.</p>
<p>The idea I am promoting here is not new, and there are various techniques towards this goal. One (which I think Oded Goldreich shared with me), is to think of audience’s attention as a limited currency. Whenever you share a big idea you spend a big token and other ideas cost a smaller token. Imagine you have one or two big tokens and a few smaller tokens. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OFAhBw0OXs">Another approach</a>, emphasizes the notion of <strong>a premise</strong>. The idea promoted here is that a talk needs a premise and this should be the title of the talk. Furthermore, every slide needs a premise and it should be the title of the slide. A premise is a main idea and is a complete sentence. It is not unusual to find a slide titled “Analysis” or “Efficiency” but neither of these is a premise. “Problem X has an efficient algorithm” could be. The talk’s premise could help you distill what you want the audience to take out of your talk. It also helps shape the talk, as everything that doesn’t serve the premise shouldn’t be there. Note that each paper can provoke many different premises and thus many different talks.</p>
<p>Here I want to play with a different idea, that I find intriguing, even if it may seem a bit extreme. It will not be controversial that a good talk (and paper) tells a story. After all, humans understand and remember narratives. But could we take inspiration from the form of storytelling in fiction writing? A vast literature, classifies different kinds of stories and explores their templates (see for example <a href="http://storybistro.com/7-story-frameworks/">this short discussion</a>).  Can we find analogues to these types in scientific research talks?</p>
<p>The type of story that is easiest to relate to is the <strong>Quest/Hero’s Journey</strong> (think Lord of the Rings). These have several distinct ingredients: a call to adventure, tests, allies, enemies, ordeal, reward, victorious return. Some research talks that follow this template do it well and preserve a sense of suspense and excitement, others seem like a long list of problems and the tricks that the work uses to handle them.</p>
<p>I believe that many other story templates can find analogues is research talks as well. Here are my initial attempts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coming of age</strong> stories – this area of research previously only had naive ideas but this works brings significant depth.</li>
<li><strong>The Under<span style="color: #000000;">dog</span></strong><span style="color: #000000;"> (think David and Goliath): a modest technique that concurred a great challenge.</span></li>
<li><strong>Rags to Riches</strong> (think the Ugly Duckling): an area or technique that were not successful prove powerful.
<ul>
<li>Similarly: <strong>Rebirth</strong> (reinvention, renewal).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Comedy</strong> (or the Clarity Tale) – conceptual works shedding a new perspective.</li>
<li><strong>Tragedy</strong> (or the Cautionary Tale) – Some impossibility results come to mind (couldn’t we view Arrow’s impossibility theorem as being tragic?)</li>
<li><strong>Redemption stories</strong>: the field so far has missed the point, was misleading or harmful, but this work makes amends.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you suggest papers and a story type that could fit them?</p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
In a recent work, Kumar, Meka, and Sahai (FOCS 2019) introduced the notion of bounded collusion protocols (BCPs), in which $N$ parties wish to compute some joint function $f:(\{0,1\}^n)^N\to\{0,1\}$ using a public blackboard, but such that only $p$ parties may collude at a time. This generalizes well studied models in multiparty communication complexity, such as the number-in-hand (NIH) and number-on-forehead (NOF) models, which are just endpoints on this rich spectrum. We construct explicit hard functions against this spectrum, and achieve a tradeoff between collusion and complexity. Using this, we obtain improved leakage-resilient secret sharing schemes against bounded collusion protocols. 

Our main tool in obtaining hard functions against BCPs are explicit constructions of leakage resilient extractors against BCPs for a wide range of parameters. Kumar et al. (FOCS 2019) studied  such extractors and called them cylinder intersection extractors. In fact, such extractors directly yield correlation bounds against BCPs. We focus on the following setting: the input to the extractor consists of $N$ independent sources of length $n$, and the leakage function Leak $:(\{0,1\}^n)^N\to\{0,1\}^\mu\in\mathcal{F}$ is a BCP with some collusion bound $p$ and leakage (output length) $\mu$. While our extractor constructions are very general, we highlight some interesting parameter settings:

1. In the case when the input sources are uniform, and $p=0.99N$ parties collude, our extractor can handle $n^{\Omega(1)}$ bits of leakage, regardless of the dependence between $N,n$. The best NOF lower bound (i.e., $p=N-1$) on the other hand requires $N&lt;\log n$ even to handle $1$ bit of leakage.

2. Next, we show that for the same setting as above, we can drop the entropy requirement to $k=$ polylog $n$, while still handling polynomial leakage for $p=0.99N$.  This resolves an open question about cylinder intersection extractors raised by Kumar et al. (FOCS 2019), and we find an application of such low entropy extractors in a new type of secret sharing.

We also provide an explicit compiler that transforms any function with high NOF (distributional) communication complexity into a leakage-resilient extractor that can handle polylogarithmic entropy and substantially more leakage against BCPs. Thus any improvement of NOF lower bounds will immediately yield better leakage-resilient extractors.

Using our extractors against BCPs, we obtain improved $N$-out-of-$N$ leakage-resilient secret sharing schemes. The previous best scheme from Kumar et al. (FOCS 2019) required share size to grow exponentially in the collusion bound, and thus cannot efficiently handle $p=\omega(\log N)$. Our schemes have no dependence of this form, and can thus handle collusion size $p=0.99N$.</div>

We unconditionally prove there exists a promise problem in promise ZSUBEXP that cannot be solved in promise RP. 
The proof technique builds upon Kabanets' easy witness method [Kab01] as implemented by Impagliazzo et. al [IKW02], with a separate diagonalization carried out on each of the two alternatives in the win-win argument. We remark that even though the easy witness method is a key component in many celebrated results in derandomization, we are not aware of any previous unconditional separation like the one we show.

We remark that the result relativizes. We could not prove a similar result for total functions, nor for functions in ZTime(T(n)) for T(n) below a half-exponential function (i.e., T such that T(T(n)) &lt; 2^n).</div>

<div class="content">
We consider the following question: using a source of labeled data and interaction with an untrusted prover, what is the complexity of verifying that a given hypothesis is "approximately correct"? We study interactive proof systems for PAC verification, where a verifier that interacts with a prover is required to accept good hypotheses, and reject bad hypotheses. Both the verifier and the prover are efficient and have access to data samples from an unknown distribution. We are interested in cases where the verifier can use significantly less data than is required for (agnostic) PAC learning, or use a substantially cheaper data source (e.g., using only random samples for verification, even though learning requires membership queries). We believe that today, when data and data-driven algorithms are quickly gaining prominence, the question of verifying purported outcomes of data analyses is very well-motivated.
		
We show three main results. First, we prove that for a specific hypothesis class, verification is significantly cheaper than learning in terms of the number of random samples required, even if the verifier engages with the prover only in a single-round (NP-like) protocol. Moreover, for this class we prove that single-round verification is also significantly cheaper than testing closeness to the class. Second, for the broad class of Fourier-sparse boolean functions, we show a multi-round (IP-like) verification protocol, where the prover uses membership queries, and the verifier is able to assess the result while only using random samples. Third, we show that verification is not always more efficient. Namely, we show a class of functions where verification requires as many samples as learning does, up to a logarithmic factor.</div>

John Littlewood lived through the 1918–1919 flu pandemic, yet he appears not to have remarked on it in print. Nor can we find mention of it by Godfrey Hardy in <em>A Mathematician’s Apology</em>—though Hardy did write about the ravages of WW I.</p>
<p>
Today, Ken and I thought you might like some fun comments that are not about the current pandemic. </p>
<p>
This is not to say we are ignoring it. We are all fighting the virus in one way or another. Our hearts go out to those of you fighting it directly. We are all worried about ourselves and others. We are stuck at home, at least most of us. We are all in this terrible time together. We hope you all are safe and well. </p>
<p>
We thought we would list a few jokes and stories that you might enjoy. We wrote recently about one kind of mathematical <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/02/28/reductions-and-jokes/">joke</a> that can be given various proportions of pure levity and mathematical content. Our friends Lance Fortnow and Bill Gasarch, plus commenters in their <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2006/06/funniest-computer-science-joke-ever.html">item</a>, collected some jokes on the computer science side.</p>
<p>
Littlewood’s notion of “mathematical joke” leaned more on mathematical content, though his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematician's_Miscellany">memoir</a> <em>A Mathematician’s Miscellany</em> includes many funny stories as well. At the end of his introduction to the book, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A good mathematical joke is better, and better mathematics, than a dozen mediocre papers. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
We will start at the levity end. This is almost a math <a href="http://web.sonoma.edu/Math/faculty/falbo/jokes.html">joke</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The Daily News published a story saying that one-half of the MP (Members of Parliament) were crooks.<br />
The Government took great exception to that and demanded a retraction and an apology.<br />
The newspaper responded the next day with an apology and reported that one-half of the MPs were not crooks. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
We like this one, even if it is not really a hardcore math one. It does rely on the fact that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%3D+1.%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1.}" class="latex" title="{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1.}" /></p>

The first one orders a beer. The second orders half a beer. The third orders a third of a beer. The bartender bellows, “Get the heck out of here, are you trying to ruin me?”</p>

The chemist and the physicist comes up with many ingenious ways to open the can. Then suddenly the mathematician gets a bright idea: “Assume we have a can opener <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" />” </p>

She sees a seminar with the title: “The Theory of Gears.” So she goes.

This appears to have been a playful swipe at Hardy’s decision to leave Cambridge for Oxford. It was couched in a discussion of events that would seem to have had tiny probabilities before they happened. </p>

The last two we’ve picked out from the above sites verge into philosophy:</p>

Littlewood’s standards for a “mathematical joke” were higher than ours, but we will start by adapting an example from this MathOverflow <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/38856/jokes-in-the-sense-of-littlewood-examples">discussion</a> of Littlewood-style jokes. Sometimes we can play a joke on ourselves by deriving a result we know is right but with an incorrect proof. Here is the example:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" title="{\bullet}" /> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1bntfg/are_there_or_can_there_be_jokes_or_puns_in/">Casting out 6’s</a>. Suppose we want to simplify the fraction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B166%7D%7B664%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\frac{166}{664}}" class="latex" title="{\frac{166}{664}}" />. We can use the rule of casting out 6’s to get </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B166%7D%7B664%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B16%7D%7B64%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \frac{166}{664} = \frac{16}{64} = \frac{1}{4}. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \frac{166}{664} = \frac{16}{64} = \frac{1}{4}. " /></p>
<p>
The rule works quite generally:</p>

<p>You can even turn the paper upside down and cast out the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B6%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{6}" class="latex" title="{6}" />‘s that you see then:</p>

<p>
Note, this is a joke: The rule of course does not actually work all the time: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B56%7D%7B65%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B5%7D%7B5%7D+%3D+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \frac{56}{65} = \frac{5}{5} = 1.

We thought to try to come up with our own examples, or at least blend in other sources. It once struck me (Ken), on reading a column by Martin Gardner on difference equations, that they give a “convincing proof” of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%5E0+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0^0 = 1}" class="latex" title="{0^0 = 1}" />. Consider the powers of a natural number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k}" class="latex" title="{k}" />, say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+%3D+5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k = 5}" class="latex" title="{k = 5}" />.

<div class="content">
<div style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">One social contribution that I tentatively attribute to Uber is popularisation of the concept of surge pricing. That is, we try to call an Uber and all-too-frequently get told that we have to pay a premium at this particular point in time, due to high demand. On the other hand, recent shortages of toilet paper, paracetamol, and certain foods were not accompanied by any kind of surge pricing, and the limits imposed on how much stuff you can buy, were not so effective in keeping these goods available. At this point, things have improved, although I have not been able to buy flour recently: the shortage of flour in the supermarkets I visit seems to be chronic.<br /><br />Now I appreciate the objection to charging to charging a premium to allcomers, rich and poor alike, in the context of vital food and medicine. (Although, limits on purchases can also be criticised as being unfair to a single purchaser buying for a large family, or a key worker who is short of time and doesn't want to search excessively for a desired item.) In trying to advocate surge pricing, let me turn instead to possible examples less controversial, such as hairdressers and garden centres. When these establishments are allowed to reopen, it seems reasonable that they should charge a premium (temporarily). Not only do they need the money, but it would help to control a flood of customers all causing long queues and infecting each other at close quarters. To be honest, I’m not optimistic that this will happen, since they will still worry about accusations of price-gouging, plus there’s the question of how big a premium is appropriate.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/04/25/the-impossibility-of-measuring-inflation-in-a-pandemic">An article in the Economist</a> highlights a related problem, which is the difficulty of measuring the rate of inflation, at a time when various goods and services (whose prices get used to measure inflation) are unavailable. Coming back to flour, it may be felt that some of it (not all!) should be sold at market price, meaning one that some people will pay, but where it stays on the shelves for a few days, at least. There is a moral case against selling goods too cheaply, which is that it becomes an attempt to hide a problem — a successful attempt, if inflation cannot be measured.<br /><br />Finally, the problem discussed here touches on a defect at the heart of traditional economic theory, which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%E2%80%93Debreu_model">celebrated existence</a> of “correct” prices, unaccompanied by a means of arriving at those prices. The Algorithmic Game Theory community has quite rightly worried about price discovery and its computational obstacles. But the obstacles are also social, and status quo bias plays a big part.</div></div>

<div style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">I managed to join a zoom meeting yesterday to honor John Conway. Peter Winkler paid tribute with a story about the brick-stacking puzzle (was interesting to hear "skintle" in context of puzzles). Roger Penrose paid tribute with tilings but also an old classic,  Morley's Trisector Theorem. Others like Don Knuth appeared in the pre-meeting chat room, but I could not stay for the entire 3 hrs+ homage. Thanks to everyone!  JHC, RIP.  I was reminded that we are the math, friends and puzzles we leave behind.<br /><br />Friends Ada and Phillip have created a short hardware tribute to JHC, video embedded below. <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/category/adafruitchronicles/" target="_blank">Ada and Phillip,</a> thanks for repurposing your NYC manufacturing line to produce face shields and PPEs.  Loved the <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/04/27/the-woman-who-discovered-the-first-coronavirus/" target="_blank">blog on the scientist who discovered the first coronavirus</a> and the handsanitizer made in Detroit.<br /><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;" class="separator"></div><br /></div></div>

Proving super-logarithmic data structure lower bounds in the static \emph{group model} has been a fundamental challenge in computational geometry since the early 80's. We prove a polynomial ($n^{\Omega(1)}$) lower bound for an explicit range counting problem of $n^3$ convex polygons in $\R^2$ (each with $n^{\tilde{O}(1)}$ facets/semialgebraic-complexity), against linear storage arithmetic data structures in the group model. Our construction and analysis are based on a combination of techniques in Diophantine approximation, pseudorandomness, and compressed sensing---in particular, on the existence and partial derandomization of optimal \emph{binary} compressed sensing matrices in the polynomial sparsity regime ($k = n^{1-\delta}$). As a byproduct, this establishes a (logarithmic) separation between compressed sensing matrices and the stronger RIP property.</div>

The study of branching programs for the Tree Evaluation Problem, introduced by S. Cook et al. (TOCT 2012), remains one of the most promising approaches to separating L from P. Given a label in $[k]$ at each leaf of a complete binary tree and an explicit function  in $[k]^2 \to [k]$ for recursively computing the value of each internal node from its children, the problem is to compute the value at the root node. The problem is parameterized by the alphabet size $k$ and the height $h$ of the tree. A branching program implementing the straightforward recursive algorithm uses $\Theta((k + 1)^h)$ states, organized into $2^h-1$ layers of width up to $k^h$. Until now no better deterministic algorithm was known.

We present a series of three new algorithms solving the Tree Evaluation Problem. They are inspired by the work of Buhrman et al. on catalytic space (STOC 2012), applied outside the catalytic-space setting. First we give a novel branching program with $2^{4h} poly(k)$ layers of width $2^{3k}$, which beats the straightforward algorithm when $h = \omega(k / \log k)$. Next we give a branching program with $k^{2h} poly(k)$ layers of width $k^3$.  This has total size comparable to the straightforward algorithm, but is implemented using the catalytic framework. Finally we interpolate between the two algorithms to give a branching program with $(O(k/h))^{2h} poly(k)$ layers of width $(O(k/h))^{\epsilon h}$ for any constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$, which beats the straightforward algorithm for all $h \geq k^{1/2 + poly(\epsilon)}$. These are the first deterministic branching programs to beat the straightforward algorithm, but more importantly this is the first non-trivial approach to proving deterministic upper bounds for Tree Evaluation.

We also contribute new machinery to the catalytic computing program, which may be of independent interest to some readers.</div>
