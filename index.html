<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>We wrapped up two amazing days of <a href="http://www.l4dc.org/">L4DC 2020</a> last Friday. It’s pretty wild to watch this community grow so quickly: starting as a <a href="https://kgatsis.github.io/learning_for_control_workshop_CDC2018/">workshop</a> at <a href="https://kgatsis.github.io/learning_for_control_workshop_CDC2018/">CDC 2018</a>, the conference organizers put together an <a href="https://l4dc.mit.edu/">inaugural event at MIT</a> in only a few months and were overwhelmed by nearly 400 attendees. Based on a groundswell of support from the participants, we decided to add contributed talks and papers this year. We had passionate volunteers for our <a href="https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/l4dc/organizers-pc">70-person program committee</a>, and they did heroic work of reviewing 135 submissions for this year’s program.</p>

<p>Then, of course, the pandemic hit forcing us to cancel our in-person event. As most conferences in a similar situation as ours, we decided to move to a virtual setting. I think that had we not had contributed papers, we would have simply canceled this year (I’ll return to this later). But to respect the passion and hard-work of our contributors, we tried to come up with a reasonable plan for running this conference virtually.</p>

<p>When we started planning to go virtual, there were too many options to sort through: Zoom webinars and breakout rooms? Sli.do Q&amp;As? Google Hangouts? Slack channels? We had so many tools for virtual community building, each with their own pluses and minuses. Our main constraints were that we wanted to highlight the best contributed papers as talks in some way, to give visibility to the wonderful set of accepted papers without burdening the authors with more work, to be inclusive to the broader community of folks interested in learning and automation, and, importantly, to not charge registration fees.</p>

<p>We eventually settled on the following scheme:</p>
<ol>
  <li>We had a Zoom room for invited and contributed speakers and moderators.</li>
  <li>This Zoom was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_sJb1k9dVY">live streamed to Youtube</a>.</li>
  <li>Questions were gathered by grad student moderators who scanned the YouTube live chat and then relayed inquiries back to the speakers.</li>
  <li>We tried to keep the live part under four hours per day and to provide ample breaks. We recognize how hard it is to sit in front of a live stream for much more than that.</li>
  <li>Further discussion was then done on <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=L4DC.org/2020/Conference">OpenReview</a>, where we hosted all accepted papers of the conference.</li>
  <li>The proceedings of the conference were subsequently archived by <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/">Proceedings of Machine Learning Research</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Though it took a lot of work to tie all these pieces together, everything went super smoothly in the end. I was basically able to run the entire AV setup from my garage.</p>

<p class="center"><img width="250px" alt="where the magic happens" src="http://www.argmin.net/assets/command_station.jpg" /></p>

<p>The only thing that cost money here was the Zoom account (20 dollars/month, though subsidized by Berkeley) and my home internet connection. I know that Zoom and YouTube have well documented issues, and I think it’s imperative that they continue to strive to fix these problems, but I also think it’s easy to forget how empowering this technology is. This format opens up conferences to those who can’t travel for financial or logistical reasons, and lowers the energy to engage with cutting edge research. Being able to sit in my garage and run a virtual conference with speakers spanning 10 time zones and nearly 2000 viewers is a wonder of modern times.</p>

<h2 id="second-life-still-has-a-long-way-to-go">Second Life still has a long way to go.</h2>

<p>There are still many parts of the online conference that felt cheated and incomplete. I still don’t know how to run a virtual poster session effectively. Most of our papers have not yet received any comments on <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=L4DC.org/2020/Conference">OpenReview</a>, though comments are still open and I’d encourage you to drop by and ask questions! Partially, I think this lack of engagement stems from the considerable amount of effort required to participate, especially when it is compared to somewhat aimlessly ambling through a poster session.</p>

<p>Indeed, many aspects of live conferences are simply not replicable with our current tools, whether they be chance encounters or meetings with friends from far away. On the other hand, maybe we shouldn’t try to replicate this experience! Maybe we need to think harder about what opportunities our technology has for building communities and how we can better support these facets of academic interaction. When I think back on the decades of conferences I’ve attended, I can think of only a few posters that really got me interested in reading a paper, and <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3323-the-tradeoffs-of-large-scale-learning.pdf">one later won a test of time award at NeurIPS</a>. Poster sessions always felt like an anachronistic means to justify a work travel expense rather than an effective means of academic knowledge dissemination. Is there a better way forward that uses our current technological constraints to amplify the voices of young scholars with cutting edge ideas? I don’t have great ideas for how to do this yet, but new interaction structures may emerge as we deal with at least one more year without meetings with hundreds of people.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-should-conferences-cost">How much should conferences cost?</h2>

<p>We were able to do L4DC, with the proceedings and all, for free. Obviously, the program committee put in tons of work in reviewing and organizing the logistics. But reviewing labor isn’t compensated by any conference. All peer reviewed conferences rely on the volunteer service labor of a dedicated program committee. The main line items we expected for L4DC were for renting physical space, paying an AV crew, and food. But in the virtual world, these expenses drop to near zero.</p>

<p>I’m supposed to give a plenary talk at the <a href="https://www.ifac2020.org/">Virtual IFAC Congress</a> in July. I have to say, I am troubled: IFAC is charging <a href="https://www.ifac2020.org/registration/">380 euros per person</a> for registration. What does one get for this sum? Access to video streams and the ability to publish papers. This seems exorbitantly expensive. Why would anyone watch a talk I give at IFAC when I promise to just release it on YouTube at the same time? What value is IFAC providing back to the academic community?</p>

<h2 id="decoupling-papers-from-talks">Decoupling papers from talks</h2>

<p>One of the main things the registration fee at many conferences provides is a stamp of academic approval. It is a de facto publication fee. Led by computer science, conferences in engineering are replacing journals as the archives where CV-building work is cataloged. Though this wasn’t the initial purpose of conferences in computer science, conferences do have many attractive features over journals for rapidly evolving fields: Conferences have speedy turn-around times and clearly delineated submission and decision dates. This archival aspect of conferences, however, has nothing to do with community building or scholarly dissemination. Why do we need to couple a talk to a publication? Can’t we separate these two as is done in every other academic field?</p>

<p>Our collective pandemic moment gives us an opportunity not only to rethink community-building but also our publication model. With 10000-person mega-conferences like <a href="http://icml.cc">AI Summer</a> and <a href="http://neurips.cc">AI Winter</a>, why can’t we keep all of the deadlines the same but remove all of the talks? We’d still have the same reviewing architecture, which has been wholly virtual for over a decade. And we could still publish all of the proceedings online for free, which has been done for multiple decades.</p>

<p>The decoupling proposal here would have effectively zero overhead on our communities: the deadlines, CMTs, program committees, and proceedings could all function exactly the same way (though, to be fair, these systems all have warts worth improving upon). New archival, fast-turnaround journals could easily start using the same tools. Indeed, I’ve always been enamored with the idea of an arxiv-overlay journal that simply is a table of contents that points towards particular versions of arxiv papers as “accepted.” And a really radical idea would be to solicit <em>talks</em>—not papers—for virtual conferences where potential speakers would submit slides or videos to demonstrate proficiency in the medium in which they’d present.</p>

<p>I tend to dismiss most of the bloviation about how coronavirus permanently changes everything about how we live our lives. But it does provide us an opportunity to pause and assess whether current systems are functioning well. I’d argue that the current conference system hasn’t been functioning well for a while, but this simple decoupling of papers and talks might clear up a lot of the issues currently facing the hard-charging computing world.</p>

Tóth</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11262">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>We introduce and study the problem of constructing geometric graphs that have
few vertices and edges and that are universal for planar graphs or for some
sub-class of planar graphs; a geometric graph is \emph{universal} for a class
$\mathcal H$ of planar graphs if it contains an embedding, i.e., a
crossing-free drawing, of every graph in $\mathcal H$.
</p>
<p>Our main result is that there exists a geometric graph with $n$ vertices and
$O(n \log n)$ edges that is universal for $n$-vertex forests; this extends to
the geometric setting a well-known graph-theoretic result by Chung and Graham,
which states that there exists an $n$-vertex graph with $O(n \log n)$ edges
that contains every $n$-vertex forest as a subgraph. Our $O(n \log n)$ bound on
the number of edges cannot be improved, even if more than $n$ vertices are
allowed.
</p>
<p>We also prove that, for every positive integer $h$, every $n$-vertex convex
geometric graph that is universal for $n$-vertex outerplanar graphs has a
near-quadratic number of edges, namely $\Omega_h(n^{2-1/h})$; this almost
matches the trivial $O(n^2)$ upper bound given by the $n$-vertex complete
convex geometric graph.
</p>
<p>Finally, we prove that there exists an $n$-vertex convex geometric graph with
$n$ vertices and $O(n \log n)$ edges that is universal for $n$-vertex
caterpillars.

and introduce the $\lambda$-regularized proportional volume sampling algorithm,
generalized from [Nikolov, Singh, and Tantipongpipat, 2019], for this problem
with the approximation guarantee that extends upon the previous work. In this
problem, we are given vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_n\in\mathbb{R}^d$ in $d$
dimensions, a budget $k\leq n$, and the regularizer parameter $\lambda\geq0$,
and the goal is to find a subset $S\subseteq [n]$ of size $k$ that minimizes
the trace of $\left(\sum_{i\in S}v_iv_i^\top + \lambda I_d\right)^{-1}$ where
$I_d$ is the $d\times d$ identity matrix. The problem is motivated from optimal
design in ridge regression, where one tries to minimize the expected squared
error of the ridge regression predictor from the true coefficient in the
underlying linear model. We introduce $\lambda$-regularized proportional volume
sampling and give its polynomial-time implementation to solve this problem. We
show its $(1+\frac{\epsilon}{\sqrt{1+\lambda'}})$-approximation for
$k=\Omega\left(\frac d\epsilon+\frac{\log 1/\epsilon}{\epsilon^2}\right)$ where
$\lambda'$ is proportional to $\lambda$, extending the previous bound in
[Nikolov, Singh, and Tantipongpipat, 2019] to the case $\lambda&gt;0$ and
obtaining asymptotic optimality as $\lambda\rightarrow \infty$.

<p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/o/Okrasa:Karolina.html">Karolina Okrasa</a>, Marta Piecyk, Paweł Rzążewski <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11155">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>A homomorphism from a graph $G$ to a graph $H$ is an edge-preserving mapping
from $V(G)$ to $V(H)$. Let $H$ be a fixed graph with possible loops. In the
list homomorphism problem, denoted by LHom($H$), we are given a graph $G$,
whose every vertex $v$ is assigned with a list $L(v)$ of vertices of $H$. We
ask whether there exists a homomorphism $h$ from $G$ to $H$, which respects
lists $L$, i.e., for every $v \in V(G)$ it holds that $h(v) \in L(v)$.
</p>
<p>The complexity dichotomy for LHom($H$) was proven by Feder, Hell, and Huang
[JGT 2003]. We are interested in the complexity of the problem, parameterized
by the treewidth of the input graph. This problem was investigated by Egri,
Marx, and Rz\k{a}\.zewski [STACS 2018], who obtained tight complexity bounds
for the special case of reflexive graphs $H$.
</p>
<p>In this paper we extend and generalize their results for \emph{all} relevant
graphs $H$, i.e., those, for which the LHom{H} problem is NP-hard. For every
such $H$ we find a constant $k = k(H)$, such that LHom($H$) on instances with
$n$ vertices and treewidth $t$
</p>
<p>* can be solved in time $k^{t} \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, provided that the
input graph is given along with a tree decomposition of width $t$,
</p>
<p>* cannot be solved in time $(k-\varepsilon)^{t} \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$,
for any $\varepsilon &gt;0$, unless the SETH fails.
</p>
<p>For some graphs $H$ the value of $k(H)$ is much smaller than the trivial
upper bound, i.e., $|V(H)|$.
</p>
<p>Obtaining matching upper and lower bounds shows that the set of algorithmic
tools we have discovered cannot be extended in order to obtain faster
algorithms for LHom($H$) in bounded-treewidth graphs. Furthermore, neither the
algorithm, nor the proof of the lower bound, is very specific to treewidth. We
believe that they can be used for other variants of LHom($H$), e.g. with
different parameterizations.

Introducing new variables is a way to shorten it. Both operations can be
expressed in terms of common equivalence, a weakened version of equivalence. In
turn, common equivalence can be expressed in terms of forgetting. An algorithm
for forgetting and checking common equivalence in polynomial space is given for
the Horn case; it is polynomial-time for the subclass of single-head formulae.
Minimizing after forgetting is polynomial-time if the formula is also acyclic
and variables cannot be introduced, NP-hard when they can.

One popular approach seeks to
ensure that each cluster contains groups in (roughly) the same proportion in
which they exist in the population. The normative principle at play is balance:
any cluster might act as a representative of the data, and thus should reflect
its diversity.
</p>
<p>But clustering also captures a different form of representativeness. A core
principle in most clustering problems is that a cluster center should be
representative of the cluster it represents, by being "close" to the points
associated with it. This is so that we can effectively replace the points by
their cluster centers without significant loss in fidelity, and indeed is a
common "use case" for clustering. For such a clustering to be fair, the centers
should "represent" different groups equally well. We call such a clustering a
group-representative clustering.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we study the structure and computation of group-representative
clusterings. We show that this notion naturally parallels the development of
fairness notions in classification, with direct analogs of ideas like
demographic parity and equal opportunity. We demonstrate how these notions are
distinct from and cannot be captured by balance-based notions of fairness. We
present approximation algorithms for group representative $k$-median clustering
and couple this with an empirical evaluation on various real-world data sets.

inner function $g$. The natural approach for obtaining a randomized decision
tree for the composed function $(f\circ
g^n)(x^1,\ldots,x^n)=f(g(x^1),\ldots,g(x^n))$ involves amplifying the success
probability of the decision tree for $g$, so that a union bound can be used to
bound the error probability over all the coordinates. The amplification
introduces a logarithmic factor cost overhead. We study the question: When is
this log factor necessary? We show that when the outer function is parity or
majority, the log factor can be necessary, even for models that are more
powerful than plain randomized decision trees. Our results are related to, but
qualitatively strengthen in various ways, known results about decision trees
with noisy inputs.

graph over vertices and must provide a clustering of vertices that minimizes
some objective function. In fair clustering problems, vertices are endowed with
a color (e.g., membership in a group), and the features of a valid clustering
might also include the representation of colors in that clustering. Prior work
in fair clustering assumes complete knowledge of group membership. In this
paper, we generalize prior work by assuming imperfect knowledge of group
membership through probabilistic assignments. We present clustering algorithms
in this more general setting with approximation ratio guarantees. We also
address the problem of "metric membership", where different groups have a
notion of order and distance. Experiments are conducted using our proposed
algorithms as well as baselines to validate our approach and also surface
nuanced concerns when group membership is not known deterministically.

well-studied basic feasible solutions of linear programs. In this paper we give
new bounds on the number of non-zero components -- their support -- of these
vertices matching either the best known bounds or improving upon them. While
the best known bounds make use of deep techniques, we only use basic results
from probability theory to make use of the concentration of measure effect. To
show the versatility of our techniques, we use our results to give the best
known bounds on the number of such vertices and an algorithm to enumerate them.
We also improve upon the known lower bounds to show that our results are nearly
optimal. One of the main ingredients of our work is a generalization of the
famous Hoeffding bound to vector-valued random variables that might be of
general interest.

function evaluations are available. Such problems arises frequently in many
important applications. In this paper, we consider stochastic zeroth-order
optimization over Riemannian submanifolds embedded in an Euclidean space, an
important but less studied area, and propose four algorithms for solving this
class of problems under different settings. Our algorithms are based on
estimating the Riemannian gradient and Hessian from noisy objective function
evaluations, based on a Riemannian version of the Gaussian smoothing technique.
In particular, we consider the following settings for the objective function:
(i) stochastic and gradient-Lipschitz (in both nonconvex and geodesic convex
settings), (ii) sum of gradient-Lipschitz and non-smooth functions, and (iii)
Hessian-Lipschitz. For these settings, we characterize the oracle complexity of
our algorithms to obtain appropriately defined notions of $\epsilon$-stationary
point or $\epsilon$-approximate local minimizer. Notably, our complexities are
independent of the dimension of the ambient Euclidean space and depend only on
the intrinsic dimension of the manifold under consideration. We demonstrate the
applicability of our algorithms by simulation results.

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>I’ve <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2018/04/18/subtraction-games.html">written here before</a> about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtraction_game">subtraction games</a>, two-player games in which the players remove tokens from a pile of tokens, the number of removed tokens is required to belong to a designated <em>subtraction set</em>, and the goal is to make the last move. For instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtract_a_square">subtract a square</a>, a game <a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.FUN.2018.20">I studied at FUN 2018</a>, is of this type, with the subtraction set being the square numbers.</p>

<p>At some point in studying these games I also briefly looked at the subtraction game whose subtraction set is the set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_number">practical numbers</a>, the numbers whose sums of divisors include all values up to the given numbers. The sequence of these numbers begins</p>



<p>and it turns out to be important here that, after the first one, they’re all even. Let’s call the subtraction game with this subtraction set <em>subpract</em>.</p>

<p>For a subtraction game, or more generally any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impartial_game">impartial game</a>, the game states can be partitioned into -positions (where the player who played previously is winning with optimal play) and -positions (where the next player to move can force a win); the -positions tend to be rarer than the -positions, and it’s important to know where they are because the optimal strategy in the game is to move to a -position whenever possible.</p>

<p><a href="http://oeis.org/A275432">OEIS A275432</a> lists the -positions for subpract. They are:</p>



<p>For instance, it’s a winning move in subpract to move to a pile of ten tokens (if you can), because  whatever move your opponent makes from there lets you win. If your opponent takes an even number of tokens, you will be able to take all the remaining tokens and win immediately. And if your opponent takes one token, leaving a pile of nine tokens, you can win by taking six more and leaving a pile of three tokens. Then, regardless of how your opponent responds, you will be able to take all the tokens on your next move.</p>

<p>An obvious pattern jumps out from this list of -positions: they come in pairs, spaced three apart. More precisely, an even number  is a -position if and only if the odd number  is a -position. It’s not just a coincidence, true at the start of the sequence and then false later on: it carries on throughout the entire sequence of -positions. More strongly, this same three-apart pairing of  -positions holds for any subtraction game whose subtraction set contains <span style="white-space: nowrap;">, , and ,</span> and does not contain any other odd numbers.</p>

<h1 id="proof-of-the-pairing-property">Proof of the pairing property</h1>

<p>To prove this, I need to show that  is a -position if and only if  is a winning position. We can prove this by induction, where we assume that all the -positions below  and  are paired up in the same way, and use it to prove that the same pairing holds for  and . The basic idea of the proof is to assume that one of the two players has a winning strategy for the <span style="white-space: nowrap;">position ,</span> and to copy that strategy for , most of the time playing the same moves and responses that you would play for the smaller position. Whenever a sequence of moves is applicable to both  and  and preserves the parity of the starting position, the induction hypothesis shows that it has the same outcome for both starting positions. However, there are a few cases where you may be forced to deviate from this strategy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If  is an -position, but its winning move is to subtract one token leading to an odd -position , then copying that move from the starting position  would lead to the position  which may not be a -position. Instead you should subtract four tokens to get to the position  directly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  is a -position, and you’re trying to copy its winning strategy in the position , your opponent may be able to subtract , a move that is not possible in , so you have no response to copy. But in this case the result is a pile of just one token, from which you can immediately win.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, if you’re trying to copy the winning strategy for -position  in the position , your opponent may subtract only one token. In this case, the winning response when starting from  might be to subtract an even number, leading to an odd -position . If you copy this response, you will end up at  which may not be a -position. But instead of copying the -strategy, you can simply subtract two tokens, leading to the position  itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, it may be the case that the winning response to an opponent’s even move from  is to take a single token, leading to odd -position . Copying this strategy from the starting position  would again lead to . But in this case you can subtract four tokens leading to  again.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It’s tempting to guess that, more strongly than pairing -positions and -positions in this way, subpract and similar subtraction games have a pairing of their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprague%E2%80%93Grundy_theorem">nim-values</a>, where the nim-value of an odd position always equals the nim-value of the even position three units smaller. But it’s not true. For instance, in subpract, a pile of four tokens has nim-value 1 while a pile of seven tokens has nim-value 4.</p>

<h1 id="other-subtraction-sets">Other subtraction sets</h1>

<p>Probably the most obvious choice of another subtraction set that begins  and has no larger odd numbers would be the powers of two, but they don’t give rise to an interesting subtraction game: the -positions are just the multiples of three. The same thing happens whenever there are no multiples of three in the subtraction set, as happens for instance with the <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/06/21/Telephone number (mathematics)">telephone numbers</a> and <a href="http://oeis.org/A003422">left factorials</a>.</p>

<p>Another natural subtraction set to which this theory applies is the sequence of <a href="http://oeis.org/A025487">Hardy–Ramanujan integers (A025487)</a>, the numbers whose prime factorization  has a non-increasing sequence of exponents . They are:</p>



<p>These are a subset of the practical numbers so one would expect their subtraction game to have more-dense -positions. My implementation found that these -positions are:</p>



<p>again obeying the offset-by-three pairing as it should, and otherwise having somewhat irregular intervals between its -positions.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://oeis.org/A000084">enumeration function of the series-parallel graphs and the cographs</a> is even after its first term because of series-parallel duality; it begins</p>



<p>These are not all practical; for instance, 10, 1532, and 43930 are not practical. The sequence of -positions for their subtraction game begins</p>



<p>mostly differing by three between consecutive values but with occasional glitches where the larger multiple-of-three subtraction set values kick in.</p>

<p>And finally, if we subtract numbers that are one less than a prime, we get the subtraction set</p>



<p>and the sequence of -positions</p>



<p>Its small values have many five-unit gaps but that pattern appears to die out after the quadruple of -positions .</p>

Jessica Deters, Izabel Aguiar, and Jacqueline Feuerborn are the authors of the <a href="https://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1036&amp;context=codee">paper</a>, “The Mathematics of Gossip.” They use infection models—specifically the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model">SIR</a>) model—to discuss gossip. Their work was done <em>before</em> the present pandemic, in 2017–2019.

Not just for today, but for the summer at least, Ken and I want to share some gossip, share some problems, and ask our readers a question.</p>
<p>
The question first. Ken and I wonder if GLL should start a virtual theory “lunch” meeting, that would meet periodically via Zoom. It would be like meeting for a theory lunch in the old days—just not all in the same room. Some topic might be agreed on, perhaps a short presentation, and always a chance to swap some gossip. Plus maybe ask the group for advice on a problem.</p>

I do miss the old meetings: </p>

What do you think? Should we have such meetings?</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Some Gossip </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The study of gossip feeds into other issues of the spread of information and misinformation during an election year. Ken’s Buffalo colleague Kenny Joseph has <a href="https://kennyjoseph.github.io/">research</a> on the spread of fake news and Twitter sentiment using mathematical tools adjacent to those of the trio above. Ken and I still intend to say more about epidemiology models ourselves when we get time. But no, here by “gossip” we just mean actual pieces of gossip—just as at a conference or other kind of in-person meeting.</p>
<p>
Here are two examples of the kind of gossip we might exchange. </p>
<p>
Anna Gilbert is moving from Michigan math to Yale math and statistics. She will be the John C. Malone Professor of Mathematics, Professor of Statistics &amp; Data Science. Pretty impressive. She was at Michigan math for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7B4%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^{4}}" class="latex" title="{2^{4}}" /> years. She told me that she could not wait for the next power of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" />, and thus had to try a new place, with new challenges. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/gilbert-1.png"><img width="127" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/gilbert-1.png?w=127&amp;h=163" class="aligncenter wp-image-17233" height="163" /></a></p>
<p>
Rich DeMillo is a long time friend who is at Georgia Institute of Technology and is not moving. He continues working on making voting fair, secure, and efficient. He is referenced in a recent article on voting issues in Georgia. See <a href="https://www.voanews.com/usa/us-politics/activists-cite-tabulation-flaw-georgia-mail-ballots">here</a> for details. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/demillo-1.jpg"><img width="149" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/demillo-1.jpg?w=149&amp;h=138" class="aligncenter wp-image-17234" height="138" /></a></p>
<p>
Note: we have in mind pleasant and factual gossip. The most useful kind is about probable directions and emphases to make projects attractive to pursue. This leads into our other component.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Possible Problems To Present </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Here are a problem from each of us as examples of what could be discussed in these meetings and why that might give advantage over just hunting the literature. Both are about factoring—always factoring…</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h3> Factoring: Ken </h3><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I, Ken, would like to know about field tests of approximative methods in quantum computing, specifically of shortcuts to Shor’s Algorithm. The approximations I have in mind are rougher than those I find in the literature and need not be physically natural.</p>
<p>
To explain, the way Shor’s algorithm is proven correct in Shor’s paper and all textbooks we know—including ours—uses an exact analysis involving the quantum Fourier transform, in which exponentially fine phase angles appear in terms. Approximation can be argued in several ways. Circuits of Hadamard, CNOT, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{T}" class="latex" title="{T}" />-gates, in which no phase angle finer than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%2F4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\pi/4}" class="latex" title="{\pi/4}" /> appears, can approximate arbitrary quantum circuits to exponential precision with polynomial overhead. With just Hadamard and Toffoli gates, hence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0}" class="latex" title="{0}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\pi}" class="latex" title="{\pi}" /> as the only phases, one can approximate the data returned by measurements in the algorithm, though without approximating the algorithm’s result vectors in complex Hilbert space. There are other ways to approximate those vectors while eliding the finer phase components. We would like to see more attention to the concrete overheads of all these methods.</p>
<p>
What I would really like to discuss, however, is efforts toward more-brusque approximations that could yield new classical attempts on factoring. For a broad example, note that not only does <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BBQP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{BQP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{BQP}}" /> reduce to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{\#P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{\#P}}" /> but also individual steps in Shor’s algorithm can be broken down as reductions to counting. Now suppose we apply approximate counting heuristics to those steps. The stock answer for why this doesn’t work to approximate quantum measurement properties <em>globally</em> is that those probabilities have the form </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++p+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bf_1%28x%29+-+f_2%28x%29%7D%7BD%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  p = \frac{f_1(x) - f_2(x)}{D} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  p = \frac{f_1(x) - f_2(x)}{D} " /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_1}" class="latex" title="{f_1}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_2}" class="latex" title="{f_2}" /> are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{\#P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{\#P}}" /> functions and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{D}" class="latex" title="{D}" /> is something like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7Bn%2F2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^{n/2}}" class="latex" title="{2^{n/2}}" />. Note the knowledge beforehand that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" /> is between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0}" class="latex" title="{0}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />. The point is that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{D}" class="latex" title="{D}" /> is exponential yet smaller than the additive approximations possible in polynomial time for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_1%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_1(x)}" class="latex" title="{f_1(x)}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_2%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_2(x)}" class="latex" title="{f_2(x)}" /> individually, so the approximation gives no help to the difference. </p>
<p>
However, this does not prevent using approximations of magnitudes that are not differences at intermediate steps. For a vein of more particular examples, I raise the translation from quantum gates to Boolean formulas in my 2018 <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-56499-8_4">paper</a> with Amlan Chakrabarti and my recent PhD graduate Chaowen Guan. This translation can encode the state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\Phi}" class="latex" title="{\Phi}" /> at any intermediate stage of an execution of Shor’s algorithm by a Boolean formula <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" />. The size of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" /> stays linear in the size of the quantum circuit being simulated—the exponential explosion happens only when we try to count solutions to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" />. The formula <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" /> encodes all the information in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\Phi}" class="latex" title="{\Phi}" />, including the implicit presence of fine phase angles. Now suppose we alter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" /> to a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi'}" class="latex" title="{\phi'}" /> whose corresponding <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\Phi'}" class="latex" title="{\Phi'}" /> is a simplified approximation of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\Phi}" class="latex" title="{\Phi}" />. The kicker is that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\Phi'}" class="latex" title="{\Phi'}" /> might not need to be a legal quantum state. The transformations in our paper for later stages of the circuit will still apply building on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi'}" class="latex" title="{\phi'}" />. </p>
<p>
Is there any chance of this working? Heuristic approaches applying SAT to factoring have been tried and found to be <a href="https://toughsat.appspot.com/">tough</a>. The nice site <a href="http://beyondnp.org/">BeyondNP</a> includes <a href="http://beyondnp.org/pages/solvers/model-counters-exact/">links</a> to #SAT counters such as <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/marcthurley/sharpsat">sharpSAT</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/kautz/Cachet/index.htm">Cachet</a>. Thus we are not asking anything outlandish. Leveraging Shor’s algorithm might be a new approach. Has anyone tried it? That’s the kind of question I would visit a conference to ask, where wider arity might work better than asking people individually. Thus also for raising it in a meeting.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h3> Factoring: Dick </h3><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I have recently been thinking about the power of weak sub-theories of Peano Arithmetic. There are many proofs known that there are an infinite number of prime numbers. The usual proofs use this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> For all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%3E1%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x&gt;1}" class="latex" title="{x&gt;1}" /> there is some prime <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" /> that divides <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" />. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Given this it is not hard to prove, in many ways, that there are an infinite number of primes. Euclid’s original proof uses it in the step: Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" /> divide <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_%7B1%7D%5Ccdots+p_%7Bn%7D+%2B+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p_{1}\cdots p_{n} + 1}" class="latex" title="{p_{1}\cdots p_{n} + 1}" />. The idea is suppose some weak theory can prove the above. This means that it can prove: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cforall+x%3E1+%5C+%5Cexists+y+%5C+y%7Cx+%5Ctext%7B+and+%7D+%5Cmathsf%7Bprime%7D%28y%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \forall x&gt;1 \ \exists y \ y|x \text{ and } \mathsf{prime}(y). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \forall x&gt;1 \ \exists y \ y|x \text{ and } \mathsf{prime}(y). " /></p>
<p>	 I believe that this shows that if the theory is weak enough that this implies that factoring is in polynomial time. Is this known? Is it true? </p>
<p>
Once again, we can hunt for literature on this. We can ask individual people, such as Avi Wigderson and various co-authors of his. But our hunch is that this topic was explored in the 1990s without a definitive resolution. It could be more effective to get up to speed on it and share ideas in a meeting.</p>

<p>Time for a non-depressing post.  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-since-Democritus-Aaronson/dp/0521199565">Quantum Computing Since Democritus</a>, which is already available in English and Russian, is about to be published in both Chinese and Japanese.  (So if you read this blog, but have avoided tackling QCSD because your Chinese or Japanese is better than your English, today’s your day!)  To go along with the new editions, Cambridge University Press asked me to write a new foreword, reflecting on what happened in the seven years since the book was published.  The editor, Paul Dobson, kindly gave me permission to share the new foreword on my blog.  So without further ado…</p>



<p></p><hr /><p></p>



<p><em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em> began its life as a course that I taught at the University of Waterloo in 2006.  Seven years later, it became the book that you now hold.  Its preface ended with the following words:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Here’s hoping that, in 2020, this book will be as badly in need of revision as the 2006 lecture notes were in 2013.</p></blockquote>



<p>As I write this, in June 2020, a lot has happened that I would never have predicted in 2013.  Donald Trump is the President of the United States, and is up for reelection shortly.  This is not a political book, so let me resist the urge to comment further.  Meanwhile, the coronavirus pandemic is ravaging the world, killing hundreds of thousands of people, crashing economies, and shutting down schools and universities (including mine).  And in the past few weeks, protests against racism and police brutality started in America and then spread to the world, despite the danger of protesting during a pandemic.</p>



<p>Leaving aside the state of the world, my own life is also very different than it was seven years ago.  Along with my family, I’ve moved from MIT to the University of Texas in Austin.  My daughter, who was born at almost exactly the same time as <em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em>, is now a first-grader, and is joined by a 3-year-old son.  When my daughter’s school shut down due to the coronavirus, I began home-schooling her in math, computer science, and physics—in some of the exact same topics covered in this book.  I’m now engaged in an experiment to see what portion of this material can be made accessible to a 7-year-old.</p>



<p>But what about the material itself?  How has it held up over seven years?  Both the bad news and the (for you) good news, I suppose, is that it’s <em>not</em> particularly out of date.  The intellectual underpinnings of quantum computing and its surrounding disciplines remain largely as they were.  Still, let me discuss what <em>has</em> changed.</p>



<p>Between 2013 and 2020, the field of quantum computing made a striking transition, from a mostly academic pursuit to a major technological arms race.  The Chinese government, the US government, and the European Union have all pledged billions of dollars for quantum computing research.  Google, Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, Alibaba, Intel, and Honeywell also now all have well-funded groups tasked with building quantum computers, or providing quantum-computing-related software and services, or even just doing classical computing that’s “quantum-inspired.”  These giants are joined by dozens of startups focused entirely on quantum computing.</p>



<p>The new efforts vary greatly in caliber; some efforts seem rooted in visions of what quantum computers will be able to help with, and how soon, that I find to be wildly overoptimistic or even irresponsible.  But perhaps it’s always this way when a new technology moves from an intellectual aspiration to a commercial prospect.  Having joined the field around 1999, before there were <em>any</em> commercial efforts in quantum computing, I’ve found the change disorienting.</p>



<p>But while some of the new excitement is based on pure hype—on marketers now mixing some “quantum” into their word-salad of “blockchain,” “deep learning,” etc., with no particular understanding of any of the ingredients—there really have been some scientific advances in quantum computing since 2013, a fire underneath the smoke.</p>



<p>Surely the crowning achievement of quantum computing during this period was the achievement of “quantum supremacy,” which a team at Google announced in the fall of 2019.  For the first time, a programmable quantum computer was used to outperform any classical computer on earth, running any currently known algorithm.  Google’s device, called “Sycamore,” with 53 superconducting qubits cooled to a hundredth of a degree above absolute zero, solved a well-defined albeit probably useless sampling problem in about 3 minutes.  To compare, current state-of-the-art simulations on classical computers need a few days, even with hundreds of thousands of parallel processors.  Ah, but will a better classical simulation be possible?  That’s an open question in quantum complexity!  The discussion of that question draws on theoretical work that various colleagues and I did over the past decade.  That work in turn draws on my so-called <strong>PostBQP</strong>=<strong>PP</strong> theorem from 2004, explained in this book.</p>



<p>In the past seven years, there were also several breakthroughs in quantum computing theory—some of which resolved open problems mentioned in this book. </p>



<p>In 2018, Ran Raz and Avishay Tal gave an oracle relative to which <strong>BQP</strong> (Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial-Time) is not contained in <strong>PH</strong> (the Polynomial Hierarchy).  This solved one of the main open questions, since 1993, about where <strong>BQP</strong> fits in with classical complexity classes, at least in the black-box setting.  (What does that mean?  Read the book!)  Raz and Tal’s proof used a candidate problem that I had defined in 2009 and called “Forrelation.”</p>



<p>Also in 2018, Urmila Mahadev gave a protocol, based on cryptography, by which a polynomial-time quantum computer (i.e., a <strong>BQP</strong> machine) could always prove the results of its computation to a classical polynomial-time skeptic, purely by exchanging classical messages with the skeptic.  Following Urmila’s achievement, I was delighted to give her a $25 prize for solving the problem that I’d announced on my blog back in 2007.</p>



<p>Perhaps most spectacularly of all, in 2020, Zhengfeng Ji, Anand Natarajan, Thomas Vidick, John Wright, and Henry Yuen proved that <strong>MIP*</strong>=<strong>RE</strong>.  Here <strong>MIP*</strong> means the class of problems solvable using multi-prover interactive proof systems with quantumly entangled provers (and classical polynomial-time verifiers), while <strong>RE</strong> means Recursively Enumerable: a class that includes not only all the computable problems, but even the infamous halting problem (!).  To say it more simply, <em>entangled provers can convince a polynomial-time verifier that an arbitrary Turing machine halts</em>.  Besides its intrinsic interest, a byproduct of this breakthrough was to answer a decades-old question in pure math, the so-called Connes Embedding Conjecture (by <em>refuting</em> the conjecture).  To my knowledge, the new result represents the first time that quantum computing has reached “all the way up the ladder of hardness” to touch uncomputable problems.  It’s also the first time that non-relativizing techniques, like the ones central to the study of interactive proofs, were ever used in computability theory.</p>



<p>In a different direction, the last seven years have witnessed an astonishing convergence between quantum information and quantum gravity—something that was just starting when <em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em> appeared in 2013, and that I mentioned as an exciting new direction.  Since then, the so-called “It from Qubit” collaboration has brought together quantum computing theorists with string theorists and former string theorists—experts in things like the black hole information problem—to develop a shared language.  One striking proposal that’s emerged from this is a fundamental role for <em>quantum circuit complexity</em>—that is, the smallest number of 1- and 2-qubit gates needed to prepare a given n-qubit state from the all-0 state—in the so-called AdS/CFT (Anti de Sitter / Conformal Field Theory) correspondence.  AdS/CFT is a duality between physical theories involving different numbers of spatial dimensions; for more than twenty years, it’s been a central testbed for ideas about quantum gravity.  But the duality is extremely nonlocal: a “simple” quantity in the AdS theory, like the volume of a wormhole, can correspond to an incredibly “complicated” quantity in the dual CFT.  The new proposal is that the CFT quantity might be not just complicated, but literally circuit complexity itself.  Fanciful as that sounds, the truth is that no one has come up with any other proposal that passes the same sanity checks.  A related new insight is that the nonlocal mapping between the AdS and CFT theories is not merely analogous to, but literally an example of, a quantum error-correcting code: the same mathematical objects that will be needed to build scalable quantum computers.</p>



<p>When <em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em> was first published, some people thought it went too far in elevating computer science, and computational complexity in particular, to fundamental roles in understanding the physical world.  But even I wasn’t audacious enough to posit connections like the ones above, which are now more-or-less mainstream in quantum gravity research.</p>



<p>I’m proud that I wrote <em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em>, but as the years go by, I find that I have no particular desire to revise it, or even reread it.  It seems far better for the book to stand as a record of what I knew and believed and cared about at a certain moment in time.</p>



<p>The intellectual quest that’s defined my life—the quest to wrap together computation, physics, math, and philosophy into some sort of coherent picture of the world—might never end.  But it does need to start somewhere.  I’m honored that you chose <em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em> as a place to start or continue your own quest.  I hope you enjoy it.</p>

<p>Dear fellow theorists,</p>



<p>As you already know, STOC 2020 this year will be a virtual conference. If you are interested in attending the conference, but haven’t registered yet, <a href="http://www.cvent.com/events/52nd-annual-acm-symposium-on-theory-of-computing-stoc-2020-/event-summary-ea5fa7861d1a476d82bc10f667a1c0f4.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">please do so soon</a> (students: $25, regular: $50). This will help us ensure we have capacity for various online events. </p>



<p>Upon registration, you should receive a confirmation email from CVENT, also containing access information for various conference events. Also, if you are a student looking to register for STOC but the cost is a burden, please email us at <a>stoc2020@ttic.edu</a>.</p>



<p><strong>How will the conference work?</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Videos</strong>: The videos for all conference talks are now available on YouTube, and can be accessed through the links in the <a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2020/STOCprogram.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conference program</a>. Registration is <em>not required</em> to view the talks on Youtube.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Slack: The conference has a Slack workspace, with one channel for every paper and workshop, and additional channels for information, announcements, social events, help, etc. The invitations for the Slack workspace will be sent to registered participants. Authors are also encouraged to monitor the channels for their papers. All access information for the conference will also be available here. The workspace is currently active, and will remain active for at least one week after the conference.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Zoom sessions</strong>: The conference will feature Zoom sessions with short presentations by the speakers. The total time for each paper is 10 minutes. Given that participants have access to the full talks by the speakers on Youtube, these can be thought of as being analogues of poster sessions. The workshops will also be held as separate sessions. The links for the Zoom sessions are available via information in the registration confirmation email.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Social events</strong>: The conference will include junior/senior “lunches”, breakout tables for impromptu and scheduled hangouts, and a group event using <a href="https://gather.town/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gather.town</a>. The timings for the events can be found in the conference program. Sign-up links for various events will be sent to all registered participants – please do sign-up soon!</li></ul>



<p>See you all at (virtual) STOC 2020. Please do let us know if you have any questions or suggestions.</p>

<p>Starting on Monday, STOC is joining the trend of conferences going online, I believe the biggest theory conference to do so thus far. Given my experience with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/">TCS+</a>, I volunteered to lend a hand with the organization and logistics. It’s been a journey (with some <a href="https://twitter.com/thegautamkamath/status/1273055827092549634">unusual technical challenges</a>), but I think we have something which I hope will be engaging and generally a lot of fun. In addition to the typical academic component, we also have a social component planned as well. We learnt from the work of others, including the <a href="https://www.acm.org/virtual-conferences">ACM virtual conferences guide</a>, <a href="https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2020">ICLR 2020</a>, and <a href="https://www.daniellitt.com/blog/2020/4/20/wagon-lessons-learned">WAGON</a>. I may make some version of our logistics docs available to others after the conference, so others can learn from our experience as well. Anyway, read on for an announcement from me and the other General Chairs, Konstantin Makarychev, Yury Makarychev, and Madhur Tulsiani. See also the <a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2020/">main STOC page</a> for a more complete list of credits.</p>

<p>Dear fellow theorists,</p>



<p>As you already know, STOC 2020 this year will be a virtual conference. If you are interested in attending the conference, but haven’t registered yet, <a href="http://www.cvent.com/events/52nd-annual-acm-symposium-on-theory-of-computing-stoc-2020-/event-summary-ea5fa7861d1a476d82bc10f667a1c0f4.aspx">please do so soon</a> (students: $25, regular: $50). This will help us ensure we have capacity for various online events. </p>



<p>Upon registration, you should receive a confirmation email from CVENT, also containing access information for various conference events. Also, if you are a student looking to register for STOC but the cost is a burden, please email us at <a href="mailto:stoc2020@ttic.edu">stoc2020@ttic.edu</a>.</p>



<p><strong>How will the conference work?</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Videos</strong>: The videos for all conference talks are now available on YouTube, and can be accessed through the links in the <a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2020/STOCprogram.html">conference program</a>. Registration is <em>not required</em> to view the talks on Youtube.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Slack</strong>: The conference has a Slack workspace, with one channel for every paper and workshop, and additional channels for information, announcements, social events, help, etc. The invitations for the Slack workspace will be sent to registered participants. Authors are also encouraged to monitor the channels for their papers. All access information for the conference will also be available here. The workspace is currently active, and will remain active for at least one week after the conference.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Zoom sessions</strong>: The conference will feature Zoom sessions with short presentations by the speakers. The total time for each paper is 10 minutes. Given that participants have access to the full talks by the speakers on Youtube, these can be thought of as being analogues of poster sessions. The workshops will also be held as separate sessions. The links for the Zoom session via information in the confirmation email.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Social events</strong>: The conference will include junior/senior “lunches”, breakout tables for impromptu and scheduled hangouts, and a group event using <a href="https://gather.town">gather.town</a>. The timings for the events can be found in the conference program. Sign-up links for various events will be sent to all registered participants – please do sign-up soon!</li></ul>



<p>See you all at (virtual) STOC 2020. Please do let us know if you have any questions or suggestions.</p></div>

<p>(1) To start with some rare good news: I was delighted that the US Supreme Court, in a 5-4 <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-587_5ifl.pdf">holding</a> led by Chief Justice Roberts (!), struck down the Trump administration’s plan to end DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals). Dismantling DACA would’ve been a first step toward deporting 700,000 overwhelmingly blameless and peaceful people from, in many cases, the only homes they remember, for no particular reason other than to slake the resentment of Trump’s base. Better still was the majority’s argument: that when, by law, a federal agency has to supply a <em>reason</em> for a policy change (in this case, ending DACA), its reason can’t just be blatantly invented <em>post facto</em>.</p>



<p>To connect to my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4845">last post</a>: I hope this gives some evidence that, if Trump refuses to accept an electoral loss in November, and if it ends up in the Supreme Court as Bush v. Gore did, then Roberts might once again break from the Court’s other four rightists, in favor of the continued survival of the Republic.</p>



<p>(2) Along with Steven Pinker, Scott Alexander, Sam Altman, Jonathan Haidt, Robert Solovay, and others who might be known to this blog’s readership, I decided after reflection to sign a <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/petition-letter-stephen-hsu/home?authuser=0">petition</a> in support of Steve Hsu, a theoretical physicist turned genomics researcher, and the Senior Vice President for Research and Innovation at Michigan State University.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dVAprDWO_YI/UzGkunExlkI/AAAAAAAAEq4/MuApiqQsX_I/s1600/photo+(4).JPG" alt="Information Processing: Hail to the Chief" />Hsu is the one on the right.</figure>



<p>Hsu now faces possible firing, because of a social media campaign apparently started by an MSU grad student and SneerClub poster named Kevin Bird.  What are the <a href="https://twitter.com/GradEmpUnion/status/1270829003130261504">charges</a>?  Hsu appeared in 2017 on an alt-right podcast (albeit, one that Noam Chomsky has also appeared on).  On Hsu’s own podcast, he <a href="https://manifoldlearning.com/episode-010-transcript/">interviewed Ron Unz</a>, who despite Jewish birth has become a <a href="https://www.unz.com/runz/american-pravda-holocaust-denial/">nutcase Holocaust denier</a>—yet somehow that topic never came up on the podcast.  Hsu said that, as a scientist, he doesn’t know whether group differences in average IQ have a genetic component, but our commitment to anti-racism should never hinge on questions of biology (a view also espoused by Peter Singer, perhaps the leading liberal moral philosopher of our time).  Hsu has championed genomics research that, in addition to medical uses, <em>might someday</em> help enable embryo screening for traits like IQ.  Finally, Hsu supports the continued use of standardized tests in university admissions (yes, that’s one of the listed charges).</p>



<p>Crucially, <strong>it doesn’t matter</strong> for present purposes if you disagree with many of Hsu’s views. The question is more like: <em>is agreement with Steven Pinker, Jonathan Haidt, and other mild-mannered, Obama-supporting thinkers featured in your local airport bookstore now a firing offense in academia?  And will those who affirm that it is, claim in the next breath to be oppressed, marginalized, the Rebel Alliance?</em></p>



<p>To be fair to the cancelers, I think they have two reasonable arguments in their favor.</p>



<p>The first that they’re “merely” asking for Hsu to step down as vice president, not for him to lose his tenured professorship in physics.  Only <em>professors</em>, say the activists, enjoy academic freedom; <em>administrators</em> need to uphold the values and public image of their university, as Larry Summers learned fifteen years ago.  (And besides, we might add, what intellectual iconoclast in their right mind would ever <em>become</em> a university VP, or want to stay one??)  I’d actually be fine with this if I had any confidence that it was going to end here.  But I don’t.  Given the now-enshrined standards—e.g., that professors hold positions of power, and that the powerful can oppress the powerless, or even do violence to them, just by expressing or entertaining thoughts outside an ever-shrinking range—why should Hsu trust any assurances that he’ll be left alone, if he <em>does</em> go back to being a physics professor?  If the SneerClubbers can cancel him, then how long until they cancel Pinker, or Haidt, or me?  (I <em>hope</em> the SneerClubbers enthusiastically embrace those ideas!  If they do, then no one ever again gets to call me paranoid about Red Guards behind every bush.)</p>



<p>The second reasonable argument is that, as far as I can tell, Hsu really did grant undeserved legitimacy to a Holocaust denier, via a friendly interview about other topics on his podcast.  I think it would help if, without ceding a word that he doesn’t believe, Hsu were now to denounce racism, Holocaust denial, and specifically Ron Unz’s flirtation with Holocaust denial in the strongest possible terms, and explain why he didn’t bring the topic up with his guest (e.g., did he not know Unz’s views?).</p></div>

Baeten, Bergstra and Klop had proved that strong bisimilarity is in fact decidable for the BPA calculus even though the class of trace languages for BPA is exactly the class of context-free languages. The result only held for normed BPA processes, that is, processes that could always terminate. Colin was my supervisor in Edinburgh, and he suggested that I try to find a simpler proof of that result (much can be said about the original proof, but simple it was not!). This turned out to be really interesting; I met Didier Caucal from IRISA who had found a nice, much shorter proof that relied on finite characterizations and I was able to use his notion of self-bisimilarity to prove that a tableau system for bisimilarity was sound and complete wrt. bisimilary. Jan Friso Groote, who was a PhD student at the CWI at the time, and myself proved that all other known equivalences are undecidable for normed BPA (and therefore </span></span></span><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="da-DK"><i>a fortiori</i></span></span></span><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="da-DK">also for full, unnormed BPA). But one problem that Colin and I were never able to solve was if the decidability result also held for the full BPA calculus.</span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;" align="justify"><br /></div><div style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;" align="justify"><span style="color: black;"><span><span style="background: transparent;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="da-DK">Søren arrived in Edinburgh in 1990 and we shared a flat there, in St Leonards Bank just across from Holyrood Park. We hung out with the same people in the LFCS, many of whom were clever Italians such as Davide Sangiorgi and clever quasi-Italians such as Marcelo Fiore. It is no surprise that Søren and I often discussed our work or that he, given that Colin was also his supervisor, moved on to study decidability problems as well, the only difference being that Søren was mostly interested in the BPP calculus that has parallel composition instead of sequential composition.</span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;" align="justify"><br /></div><div style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;" align="justify"><span style="color: black;"><span><span style="background: transparent;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="da-DK">When I left Edinburgh at the end of August of 1991, Colin and I had managed to make some progress on the decidability problem for unnormed BPA.

When I returned for my viva in December, Søren had found an important lemma on finite characterizations and everything fell into place.

Robin Milner was still around and busy working on the pi-calculus together with Davide Sangiorgi, who was his student at the time. Watching them at the blackboard was interesting, even though the rest of us often could not follow their discussions! Gordon Plotkin was there (and still is, fortunately). Rod Burstall was still active, and so was Mike Fourman. Plus many, many others. There was always someone to talk to, and it was perfectly legitimate to have an interest in basic research. Unlike the other professors, Colin had no background in maths – he was originally a philosopher! – and maybe that was why he was trying to avoid heavy mathematical lingo, trying to be simple and precise in his writing at the same time. I learned a lot from him, also in that respect.</span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;" align="justify"><br /></div><div style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;" align="justify"><span style="color: black;"><span><span style="background: transparent;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="da-DK">After Søren returned to Denmark, he left academia and got a job in the private sector.

What is more, the open problems that remained were major challenges. Some were only solved much later (such as the decidability of bisimilarity for pushdown automata, a result due to Sénizergues, the proof later greatly simplified by Colin) or remain open (such as the decidability of weak bisimilarity for BPA). Eventually I drifted down the slippery slope and became interested in other, related topics, and focused somewhat more directly on program properties. The follow-up result that most directly relates to my paper with Søren and Colin is the result from 1994 that bisimilarity is also the only equivalence that is decidable for BPP. This is a result that I am also quite proud of. It grew out of discussions with Javier Esparza and Yoram Hirshfeld, when I was back in Edinburgh for a while in 1993. Ironically, there was a subtle flaw in the proof that Naoki Kobayashi discovered many years later. Naoki and one of his student found out how to repair the proof, and the three of us co-authored the journal version that came out many years later. The reason why Naoki became interested in BPP was that he was trying to use the calculus as a behavioural type system for a pi-calculus. As it happened, this was also the route that I had taken.</span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;" align="justify"><br /></div><div style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;" align="justify"><span style="color: black;"><span><span style="background: transparent;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="da-DK">Those of my later results that I am most proud of have to do with this area: My work on type systems for psi-calculus (CONCUR 2011 and later) and a session type system for bounded name use in the pi-calculus (Acta Informatica 2019).

<div><i>Guest post by Varsha Dani.</i></div><div><br /></div><div>My 11-year-old child received a letter in the mail. "Send a book to the first person named," it said, "then move everyone's name up the list, add your own name and send copies of the letter to six friends. In a few weeks you will receive 36 books from all over the world!". Wow. When I first encountered chain letters in the mid eighties, it was postcards, but even then it hadn't taken me in. Since then I hadn't seen one of these in a long time, but I guess with a lot of people suddenly at home for extended periods, people crave both entertainment and a connection to others. </div><div><br /></div><div>What's wrong with chain letters? Well quite apart from the fact that they are illegal, even a child can comprehend that the number of books (or postcards or other gifts) received must equal the number sent, and that for every participant who does get a rich reward, there will be many who get nothing. </div><div><br /></div><div>But there is another kind of chain communication going around. It is an email, asking the recipient to send a poem or meditation to somebody, and later they will receive many communications of the same sort. How endearing. Poetry. Sweetness and Light. No get-rich-quick pyramid schemes here. What's wrong with that? </div><div><br /></div><div>Of course, it depends on what one means by "wrong". Maybe you like exchanging poetry with strangers. Maybe you don't find it onerous or wish that your spam filter would weed it out. But let's leave aside those issues and look at the math alone. You send the email to two friends, each of whom forwards it to two of their friends and so on. So the number of people the email reaches ostensibly doubles every step. Exponential growth. But in fact that is not what the graph of human connections looks like. Instead, what happens is that the sets of friends overlap, so that after a while the growth stops being exponential and tapers down. </div><div><br /></div><div>Where else have we seen something like that? Oh, right. The pandemic. The virus jumps from infected people to the people they meet, and from them to the people they meet and so on. Initially, that's exponential growth fof new cases, but after a while  it tapers off, forms a peak and then starts to decrease. Why? Because eventually there is overlap in the sets of people that each infected person is "trying" (unintentionally) to infect, and a newly infected person who got the virus from one or many previously infected people is still just one newly infected person.  </div><div><br /></div><div>So the chain letter spreads just like a virus. Indeed if one were to, somewhat fancifully, think of the chain letter as an independent entity whose goal is to self-replicate, then it looks even more like a virus, and, like a virus, it can only achieve its self-replication goal through the help of a host. But here's a way in which it is not like a virus. Once one has got the virus and recovered, one (hopefully) does not get it again. Not so the chain letter, of which one may get many copies over time! So maybe you will get some gifts or poetry, but you will likely also get more requests for them!</div><div><br /></div><div>So what's wrong with the poetry chain email? It depends on your perspective.  To those of you who are wistfully waiting for that Poem from a Stranger, I dedicate the following to you.</div><div><br /></div><hr /><div><br /></div><div><i>An open letter to my 2<sup>n</sup> dearest friends:</i></div><div><br /></div><div>A letter came for me today</div><div>It promised wondrous ends</div><div>If only I would forward it </div><div>To just two other friends.</div><div><br /></div><div>If they in turn should send it on</div><div>to two more that they know,</div><div>the goodwill that we're sending out</div><div>would grow and grow and grow.</div><div><br /></div><div>Is this as pleasant as it seems?</div><div>Alas, dear friends, it's not.</div><div>This exponential growth can lead</div><div>To quite a sticky spot.</div><div><br /></div><div>Friends of friends of friends of mine</div><div>May very well be linked</div><div>The further that the letters go.</div><div>These folks are not distinct!</div><div><br /></div><div>Ensuring there's no overlap</div><div>Is a logistic* pain.</div><div>As you will see, when you receive</div><div>That letter yet again. </div><div><br /></div><div>So while you're stuck at home this year</div><div>And pacing in your room.</div><div>Pick up the phone and make a call</div><div>Or see your friends on Zoom.</div><div><br /></div><div>Your real thoughts would make me smile.</div><div>Chain letters are a con.</div><div>Do everyone a favor and</div><div>Don't send that letter on!</div><div><br /></div><div>--------------</div><div>* Pun intended. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function#In_medicine:_modeling_of_a_pandemic">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function#In_medicine:_modeling_of_a_pandemic</a></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

<p><em>We discuss our recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09994">paper</a> 
on identifying the role of backgrounds in image classification. Along with our
results, we’re releasing our code and datasets <a href="https://github.com/MadryLab/backgrounds_challenge">as a benchmark</a>.</em></p>

<p>As we discussed in our <a href="https://gradientscience.org/benchmarks">last post</a>, quantitative
benchmarks are key drivers of progress across many computer vision tasks. 
On tasks like image classification, state of the art is often determined by models’
accuracies on standard datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. 
Still, model accuracy isn’t all that matters, as evidenced by investigations into
robustness (e.g., <a href="https://gradientscience.org/intro_adversarial">[1]</a>), 
reliability (e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12261">[2]</a>), 
and out-of-distribution performance (e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02690">[3]</a>). 
These properties are governed not only by models’ predictions on test data, but
also by the specific set of correlations models use, and by how these
correlations are combined to make predictions. 
For example, previous work has shown that model predictions can behave
unexpectedly due to reliance on correlations that we humans 
don’t rely on (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11561">[4]</a>,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04200">[5]</a>,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02175">[6]</a>, 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00401">[7]</a>); or due to overusing even
human-recognizable correlations such as texture (e.g., 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12231">[8]</a>,
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6306249/">[9]</a>) or color 
(e.g., <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1068/p3376">[10]</a>). 
So it follows that if we want to understand these more complex properties of
machine learning models, we must first be able to characterize the correlations
that these models leverage.</p>

<p>Needless to say, a full characterization of the features and signals exploited
by deep neural networks is far beyond the scope of any single paper. In our
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09994">latest paper</a>, 
we thus take a deep dive into one specific kind of signal: <em>image backgrounds</em>.</p>

<p>Backgrounds are an established source of correlation between images and
their labels in object detection: ML models may use backgrounds in
classification (cf.
<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00171412/file/ZhangMarszalekLazebnikSchmid-IJCV07-ClassificationStudy.pdf">[11]</a>,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938">[12]</a>, 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06596">[13]</a>,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08731">[14]</a>), and even human
vision can make use of image context (cf.
<a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/torralba/IJCVobj.pdf">[15]</a> and references). 
We thus want to understand better how current
state-of-the-art image classifiers rely on image backgrounds. 
Specifically, we investigate the extent of this reliance, its implications, and how models’ use of
backgrounds has evolved over time.</p>

<h2 id="a-new-dataset-or-seven">A new dataset (or seven)</h2>

<p>Our main tool for understanding how models use background signals is a set of
synthetic datasets that we refer to as ImageNet-9 (IN9). These datasets aim
to disentangle images’ foreground and background signals and thus enable us
to study their relative effects.</p>

<p>To generate ImageNet-9, we start by organizing a subset of ImageNet into nine
coarse-grained classes based on common ancestry in the <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu">WordNet hierarchy</a>: the
resulting “super-classes” are dog, bird, vehicle, reptile, carnivore, insect, 
instrument, primate, and fish. We call the 9-class dataset of unmodified images
Original.
We then use a combination of the bounding boxes
provided by ImageNet and the computer vision library <a href="https://opencv.org">OpenCV</a> to separate the
foreground and background in each imagewe deleted any images where this
process was unsuccessful (e.g., if there is no bounding box provided by ImageNet, or the bounding box takes up the entirety of the image).</p>

<p>Once we’ve separated the foreground and background signals, we introduce
 <em>seven</em> new datasets, falling into three categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Background-only datasets
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Only-BG-B</strong>: Black out the bounding boxes given by ImageNet annotations,
leaving only the background.</li>
      <li><strong>Only-BG-T</strong>: Take Only-BG-B and replace the blacked-out region with a
tiled version of the rest of the image (the background).</li>
      <li><strong>No-FG</strong>: Use OpenCV to extract the exact shape of the foreground, and
replace it with black.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Foreground-only datasets
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Only-FG</strong>: The exact complement of No-FG—rather than removing
the foreground, remove everything else.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mixed datasets
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mixed-Rand</strong>: For each image, overlay the foreground (extracted using
OpenCV) onto the background from a different random image (again,
extracted using OpenCV).</li>
      <li><strong>Mixed-Next</strong>: Assign each class a number from 1 to 9. For each image of
class $y$, add the background from a random image of class $y+1$ (or $1$, if
$y=9$).</li>
      <li><strong>Mixed-Same</strong>: For each image, add the background from a random image of
the same class.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="putting-imagenet-9-to-work">Putting ImageNet-9 to work</h2>

<p>It turns out that these proposed ImageNet-9 datasets allow us to ask (and
answer) a variety of questions about the role of background signals in image
classification.</p>

<h3 id="1-is-background-signal-enough-for-classification">1. Is background signal enough for classification?</h3>

<p>Before we look at the behaviour of standard ML models, we first double-check
that background signals are exploitable in the first place—i.e., that models
can learn reasonably accurate classifiers for natural images while being trained
on backgrounds alone. 
We are not the first ones to consider this question (e.g.,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06596">[13]</a>) but it serves as a useful sanity 
check and gives us a baseline to compare the rest of our experiments to.</p>

<p>We train models on the Only-BG-T, Only-BG-B, and No-FG datasets; the models
generalize reasonably well to both their corresponding test sets <em>and</em> the Original
test set (each model gets around 40-50% accuracy: a random classifier would get
11%). Thus, image backgroundsInterestingly, the No-FG model doesn't do
significantly better than the others, despite having access to the shape of the
foregrounds in the training set. <em>do</em> contain signal that
models can use to classify images.</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/images/background/bg_only_train.png" style="width: 70%;" alt="The results of training models on background-only datasets and testing on the original." /></p>

<h3 id="2-do-models-actually-use-background-signals">2. Do models actually use background signals?</h3>

<p>So, backgrounds are indeed a useable signal for deep learning classifiers.
That’s not necessarily bad, or even different to humans: if you see an
occluded picture with an underwater background, you’d (hopefully) say that the
pictured object is more likely to be a fish than a dog.
On the other hand, humans are still able to call a dog a dog when it’s
underwater, i.e., a misleading/irrelevant background usually does not preclude us from
making the correct predictions. Is the same true for models?</p>

<p>To answer this question, we study model accuracies on the Mixed-Rand dataset,
where image backgrounds are randomized and thus provide no information 
about the correct label. 
Specifically, we compare model performance on Mixed-Rand and Mixed-Same: the
latter maintains the foreground-background correlation (since the background is
from the correct class), while controlling for artifactsSee
Appendix D of our paper for more details! from image
splicing process.</p>

<p>We denote the accuracy gap between Mixed-Same and Mixed-Rand as the BG-Gap,
i.e., the drop in model accuracy due to changing the class signal from the
background. The table below summarizes our observations: the BG-Gap is
13-22% and 6-14% for models trained on IN-9 and ImageNet, respectively,
suggesting that backgrounds often mislead state-of-the-art models even
when the correct foreground is present. (As we discuss in Appendix B of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09994">our
paper</a>, ImageNet-trained models do seem to be
more robust in this sense, but the reason for this robustness is hard to pin down.)</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/images/background/table.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="Evaluating pretrained models on Imagenet, Mixed-Rand, and Mixed-Same to compute the BG-Gap." /></p>

<h3 id="3-ok-but-how-bad-can-it-get">3. Ok, but how bad can it get?</h3>

<p>The BG-Gap introduced in the previous experiment measures, in some sense,
models’ average robustness to misleading backgrounds. What does the worst case
look like? To diagnose just how large of an issue background over-reliance
can be, we search for the worst extracted background corresponding for each
extracted foreground. It turns out that a ResNet-50 model can be fooled on
87.5% of foregrounds by overlaying them on a corresponding “adversarial background.”</p>

<p>In fact, there also turn out to exist backgrounds that consistently affect the
prediction of the classifier <em>regardless</em> of what foreground is overlaid onto
them. The backgrounds below (extracted from insect images) fool our model into
predicting “insect” on up to 52\% of non-insect foregrounds:
<img src="https://gradientscience.org/images/background/insect_result.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="Adversarial Backgrounds" /></p>
<div class="footnote">
        The 5 most fooling backgrounds from the insect class, as well as the percent of non-insect foregrounds that they individually fool.
</div>

<p>Further, we can make the classifier predict “insect” on over 2/3 of the
foregrounds in the ImageNet-9 dataset, just by combining the foregrounds with
different insect backgrounds.</p>

<h3 id="4-what-is-the-effect-of-the-training-dataset">4. What is the effect of the training dataset?</h3>

<p>So far, all of the models that we’ve looked at have been trained on natural
data, i.e., either on the Original dataset from IN9, or on ImageNet itself.
We now want to test whether the previously-observed dependence on backgrounds
can be reduced (or removed altogether) by appropriately altering the training data.</p>

<p>To this end, we train models on Mixed-Rand, where background signals have been
decorrelated from class labels. 
We find these models perform only slightly better than
random on datasets with no foregrounds (e.g., a ResNet-50 trained on Mixed-Rand
achieves 15% accuracy on Only-BG-T and Only-BG-B).
They also perform better in the presence of misleading backgrounds:
training on Mixed-Rand improves accuracy on Mixed-Rand by 17%, and improves
accuracy on Mixed-NextRecall that Mixed-Next
images have foregrounds from class $y$ mixed with backgrounds from class $y+1$,
labeled as class $y$. by 22%. The model trained on
Mixed-Rand also has very little variation in accuracy across all five test sets
that contain the correct foreground (providing more evidence for its invariance
to other factors).</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/images/background/mixed_rand_results.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="Training on Mixed-Rand and evaluating on other datasets" /></p>

<p>Qualitatively, the Mixed-Rand model also appears to place more relative
importance on foreground pixels than its original counterpart, as demonstrated
by the saliency maps below:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/images/background/saliency_other.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="Saliency maps for models trained on original versus on Mixed-Rand" /></p>

<h3 id="5-are-we-really-making-progress">5. Are we really making progress?</h3>

<p>We’ve now shown that models can exploit backgrounds, do exploit backgrounds, and
may actually do so to a fault. Considering that the development of these models
is driven by standard computer vision benchmarks, our results beg the question: to
what extent have improvements on ImageNet come with (or resulted from)
improvements in leveraging background correlations? And relatedly, how has
model robustness
to misleading background signals evolved over time?</p>

<p>As a first step towards answering these questions, we study the progress made by
ImageNet models on our proposed synthetic datasets. Below, we plot accuracy on
these datasets against ImageNet accuracy for a variety of different
network architectures:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/images/background/in_vs_bg.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="ImageNet accuracy plotted against accuracy on synthetic datasets" /></p>

<p>The plot indicates that accuracy increases on ImageNet generally correspond to
accuracy increases on all of the synthetic datasets that we consider. 
This includes the datasets that only contain background signals (Only-BG-T
in the graph above), which means that models <em>do</em> improve at extracting correlations
from image backgrounds. The fact that better models are also better at
classifying background-only images suggests that the use of background
signals might be inherent to the current training paradigm, and may
not disappearThough again, this might not be a bad
thing! on its own (i.e., without explicit regularization
or training).</p>

<p>Still, models’ <em>relative</em> improvement in accuracy across dataset variants is
promising—accuracy on background-only datasets is improving slower than
accuracy on datasets where the background is misleading, such as Mixed-Rand or
Mixed-Next. Another promising sign is that the
performance gap between the Mixed-Rand and Mixed-Same dataset (which we
previously referred to as the BG-Gap) trends towards closing, indicating that
models are not only better at using foreground features, but also more
robust to misleading background features.</p>

<p>Overall, our analysis reveals that better models in terms of ImageNet accuracy
are (a) increasingly capable of exploiting background correlations, but at the
same time (b) becoming more robust to changes in background, suggesting that
over-reliance on background features may not be necessary to maximize the
benchmark accuracy.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>In this post, we saw how computer vision models tend to over-rely on image
backgrounds in image classification. On one hand, our findings provide more
evidence that our models are not fully aligned with the human vision system. On the
other hand, we have shown that advances in computer vision models, such as new
architectures and training methods, have led to models that tend to use the
foreground more effectively and are more robust to misleading backgrounds.
We hope that the datasets and findings in this work provide a way to monitor
progress towards reliable, human-aligned machine learning.</p>

There's a whole new, interesting theory trend  -- Algorithms with Predictions.  The idea, spurred by advances in machine learning, is that you assume you have predictor that tells you something about your input.  For example, in caching, you might have a prediction of when the item you are currently accessing will be next accessed.  Of course, machine learning predictions aren't perfect.  Still, you'd like to use this prediction to improve your caching algorithm, but from the theory side, we'd like provable statements.  For example, you could say, if my prediction is THIS good (e.g., the error is bounded under some metric), then my caching performance will correspondingly be at least THIS good (e.g., performance bounded in some way).<br /><br />If you haven't seen the burgeoning spread of this line of work and are interested, you're in luck.  First, Sergei Vassilvitskii and I have written a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09123">brief survey that's now on the arxiv</a>.  We had written it for a collection Tim Roughgarden is organizing on Beyond Worst-Case Analysis (that we thought we be out by now, and should be out from the publisher soon-ish), but we've gone ahead and put a version on the arxiv to make it available.  The area is moving fast, so there are already many new results --  we hope to update the "survey" with new material as the area grows.<br /><br />Second, one of the <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~vakilian/stoc-workshop.html">STOC'20 Workshops will be on Algorithms with Predictions</a>.  It will be on Friday from 1-4pm, with speakers Tim Roughgarden, Edith Cohen,  Ravi Kumar, and me.  I'll be talking about some of my recent work  (in submission) on queues with predictions, and partitioned learned Bloom filters.  (Arxiv papers are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00732">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12155">here</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03176">here</a>, but maybe you want to see the talk first.)  I'll also do a blog post on partitioned learned Bloom filters in the near future.</div>

Norbert Blum is a computer science theorist at the University of Bonn, Germany. He has made important contributions to theory over his career. Another claim to fame is he was a student of Kurt Mehlhorn, indeed the <a href="https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=35475&amp;fChrono=1">third</a> of Mehlhorn’s eighty-eight listed students.</p>
<p>
Today I wish to discuss a new paper by Blum.</p>
<p><span id="more-17204"></span></p>
<p>
No, it does not solve the P versus NP problem. The title of his paper is: <i>On the Approximation Method and the P versus NP Problem</i>. Its is available <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.03486.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>
Blum. like most complexity theorists, believes that P is weaker than NP. This is usually stated as P<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cneq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\neq}" class="latex" title="{\neq}" />NP. The staff at GLL have the idea that we should state this as 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++P+%3C+NP.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  P &lt; NP. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  P &lt; NP. " /></p>
<p>This is clearer, more to the point, and logically what P<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cneq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\neq}" class="latex" title="{\neq}" />NP actually says. We will soon have T-shirts, mugs, and other stuff available in our web store at https:donotgotothisaddressplease.com. </p>

</p><p></p><h2> Three Years Ago </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
In 2017 Blum released a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03486">paper</a> that tried to prove P<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{&lt;}" class="latex" title="{&lt;}" />NP. It caused a sensation—it was discussed on the complexity blogs such as <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2017/08/15/on-norbert-blums-claimed-proof-that-p-does-not-equal-np/">In theory</a> and <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3409">Shtetl-Optimized</a>. And also at <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2017/08/17/on-the-edge-of-eclipses-and-pnp/">GLL</a>. Blum’s paper got thousands of Twitter mentions. Unfortunately he had to retract it, since it is wrong: He said: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The proof is wrong. I shall elaborate precisely what the mistake is. For doing this, I need some time. I shall put the explanation on my homepage </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Look at <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2017/08/15/norbert-blum-on-p-versus-np/">here</a> for more comments that were made after his paper was released. </p>
<p>
He did, months later in 2017, post a two-page retraction<br />
<a href="http://theory.cs.uni-bonn.de/blum/PvsNP/mistake.pdf">here</a>. His original paper’s abstract: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Berg and Ulfberg and Amano and Maruoka have used CNF-DNF-approximators to prove exponential lower bounds for the monotone network complexity of the clique function and of Andreev’s function. We show that these approximators can be used to prove the same lower bound for their non-monotone network complexity. This implies P not equal NP. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This approach is what we will discuss.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Today </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Blum’s new paper does not claim to prove P<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{&lt;}" class="latex" title="{&lt;}" />NP, but gives his thoughts on P<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{&lt;}" class="latex" title="{&lt;}" />NP. I think he has earned our attention. It must have been difficult to go from thinking you have solved <i>the problem</i> to retracting your paper. I have thought, privately, that I had solved some neat problems. Only later to discover that I was wrong. I cannot imagine how tough it was to do this in public. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Idea </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Blum’s work on proving lower bounds began with his dissertation under Mehlhorn, which included a 1985 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304397585900301">paper</a> on monotone network complexity for convolutions. Earlier in 1984 Blum <a href="https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/0304397583900294? which was improved token=1F67F05B416D89618750BC409200E17D536C46207555E1A9FD524B2592630E400FC2C597EA81F7190D2A747A4B82F28B">proved</a> a lower bound of order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{3n}" class="latex" title="{3n}" />. This stood for thirty years until in 2015 Magnus Find, Alexander Golovnev, Edward Hirsch, and Alexander Kulikov <a href="https://tsapps.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=919494">improved</a> it to order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3.011n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{3.011n}" class="latex" title="{3.011n}" />. A long way from super-polynomial lower bounds. See also a <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/docs/3815/20151001gateelimination.pdf">talk</a> about this work. </p>
<p>
Blum’s new paper discusses an old approach to prove boolean circuit lower bounds. The methods he used in 1984 and those improved in 2015 do not seem to be on track to prove even non-linear circuit lower bounds. </p>
<p>
Let’s look at his comments at a high level. See his paper for details. </p>
<p>
Suppose that one has a boolean function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f(x)}" class="latex" title="{f(x)}" /> that is monotone: recall this means that if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%29%3D1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f(x)=1}" class="latex" title="{f(x)=1}" />, then changing some input <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_%7Bk%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_{k}}" class="latex" title="{x_{k}}" /> from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0+%5Crightarrow+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0 \rightarrow 1}" class="latex" title="{0 \rightarrow 1}" /> does not change the value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f(x)}" class="latex" title="{f(x)}" />. Then it is always possible to compute <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f(x)}" class="latex" title="{f(x)}" /> without using any negations: only and/or operations are needed. Sometimes one can prove that the number of such operations is super-linear, sometimes even super-polynomial. Even bounds in this restricted model can be deep.</p>
<p>
The idea that has tempted Blum and many other complexity theorists is: Can we extend the proofs for lower bounds without negations to ones with negations? One problem is there is a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f(x)}" class="latex" title="{f(x)}" /> so that the following are true: </p>
<ol>
<li>
The function is monotone; <p></p>
</li><li>
The function can be computed in polynomial time; <p></p>
</li><li>
Any monotone circuit for computing the function requires exponential size
</li></ol>
<p>This is the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardos_function">Tardos function</a> due to Éva Tardos. The existence of this function sunk Blum’s original paper. And it makes life hard for this general program—this is an instance of what our previous <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/06/13/proof-checking-not-line-by-line/">post</a> meant by a proof attempt running up against a fundamental law. Negations can help tremendously in computing a function. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Blum’s Paper </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
In his new <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.03486.pdf">paper</a> he surveys boolean complexity ideas—especially those linked to monotone complexity. He begins by trying to argue that the largeness feature of the <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/03/25/whos-afraid-of-natural-proofs/">natural proofs</a> barrier, which applies to combinatorial properties defined via sub-additive circuit complexity measures, does not constrain approximation complexity measures of the kind he envisions. He then proceeds to define <em>CNF-DNF approximators</em> and further what he calls <em>sunflower approximators</em>. He does enough development to highlight a missing piece of information about monomial representations of <em>non-</em>approximated pieces of the Boolean function one is trying to prove hard. He concludes that without this information, his methods cannot even prove super-<em>linear</em> size lower bounds on general circuits.</p>
<p>
He ends with this assessment: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> How to proceed the work with respect to the P versus NP problem? Currently, I am convinced that we are far away to prove a super-polynomial lower bound for the non-monotone complexity of any explicit Boolean function. On the other hand, the strongest barrier towards proving P<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3C%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{&lt;}" class="latex" title="{&lt;}" />NP could be that it holds P = NP. To ensure that the whole time spent for working on the P versus NP problem is not used to prove an impossible theorem, I would switch to the try to develop a polynomial algorithm for the solution of an NP-complete problem. </em>

Ken and I agree with him on trying to work both on P<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{&lt;}" class="latex" title="{&lt;}" />NP and P=NP. However, see our comments below. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I applaud Blum for thinking about P<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{&lt;}" class="latex" title="{&lt;}" />NP. We need people to be fearless if it is ever going to be solved. However, I personally believe that his approach may be wrong:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> I am not as sure as he is that P<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{&lt;}" class="latex" title="{&lt;}" />NP. I do think that P=NP is possible, especially if algorithms are allowed to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_algorithm">galactic</a>. Recall these are algorithms that run in polynomial time, but in polynomials of astronomical degree.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Also I am not sure if the boolean approach to P<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{&lt;}" class="latex" title="{&lt;}" />NP is the right one. Suppose there is a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C}" class="latex" title="{C}" /> so that SAT has boolean circuits of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7BC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n^{C}}" class="latex" title="{n^{C}}" /> where 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++C+%3D+2%5E%7B2%5E%7B2%5E%7B10000%7D%7D%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  C = 2^{2^{2^{10000}}}. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  C = 2^{2^{2^{10000}}}. " /></p>
<p>It still could be the case that P<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{&lt;}" class="latex" title="{&lt;}" />NP, since there may be no uniform algorithm for SAT.</p>
<p>
Restating the last point: I believe we should try to prove what is needed, and not any more. The approach to P<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{&lt;}" class="latex" title="{&lt;}" />NP based on boolean circuit complexity is trying to prove too much. A proof that SAT has super-polynomial circuits does imply more than P<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{&lt;}" class="latex" title="{&lt;}" />NP. A proof that SAT cannot be solved in time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%28n%5Clog+n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="o(n\log n)" class="latex" title="o(n\log n)" /> on a multitape Turing machine would imply much less than P &lt; NP, yet still be a breakthrough</p>
<p>
Be cheap, prove the least possible. </p>

Igusa's local zeta function $Z_{f,p}(s)$ is the generating function that counts the number of integral roots, $N_{k}(f)$, of $f(\mathbf x) \bmod p^k$, for all $k$. It is a famous result, in analytic number theory, that $Z_{f,p}$ is a rational function in $\mathbb{Q}(p^s)$. We give an elementary proof of this fact for a univariate polynomial $f$. Our proof is constructive as it gives a closed-form expression for the number of roots $N_{k}(f)$. 

Our proof, when combined with the recent root-counting algorithm of (Dwivedi, Mittal, Saxena, CCC, 2019), yields the first deterministic poly($|f|, \log p$) time algorithm to compute $Z_{f,p}(s)$. Previously, an algorithm was known only in the case when $f$ completely splits over $\mathbb{Q_p}$; it required the rational roots to use the concept of generating function of a tree (Zuniga-Galindo, J.Int.Seq., 2003).</div>

<h3><a class="entryheader" href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2020/06/presentations-of-diffie-helman-leave.html">Presentations of Diffie-Helman leave out how to find g</a></h3>

<div class="content">
When I first taught Diffie Helman I read the following<br />
1) Alice and Bob agree on p a prime and g a generator<br />
2) Alice picks a, sends g^a to Bob, Bob picks b, sends g^b to Alice<br />
3) Alice computes (g^b)^a and Bob computes (g^a)^b so they both have g^{ab}<br />
<br />
I knew how to find a prime- pick a number of length n (perhaps make sure the last digit is not even) and test for primality, if not then try again, you'll get one soon enough. I did not know how to find g. I had thought you<i> first </i>find p, and<i> then</i> given p you find g. I then figured out that you make actually pick  p to be a  <i>safe prime</i>, so q=(p-1)/2 is a prime, and then just pick random g and test them via computing  g^2  and g^q: if neither is 1 then g is a generator. You will find a generator soon enough.<br />
<br />
That was all fine. But how come my source didn't <i>say </i>how to find g.?You need to know that to run the algorithm. That was years ago. Then I wondered how common it is for an explanation to not say how to find g. So I Googled ``Diffie-Helman'' I only record those that had some technical content to them, and were not about other DH such as Elliptic Curves.<br />

2) <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Diffie-HellmanProtocol.html">Wolfram's MathWorld</a>:<i> They agree on two prime numbers g and p, where p is large and g is a prim root mod p. In practice it is good to choose p such that (p-1)/2 is also prime. </i>They mention (p-1)/2 but not for the reason I give. (There are algorithms for Discrete Log that do well if (p-1)/2 has many factors.)<br />
<br />
3) <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/diffie-hellman-key-exchange/">Comparatech</a>: <i>Alice and Bob start out by deciding two numbers p and g.</i> No mention of how to find p or g.<br />

7) <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~baker/40/handouts/rev_DH/node1.html">Notes from a UCLA Crypto Course</a> YEAH! They say how to find g.<br />
<br />
8) <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/diffie-hellman-protocol/">Brilliant (yes that really is the name of this site)</a> Brilliant? Not brilliant enough to realize you need to say how to find p and g.<br />
<br />
9) <a href="https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Diffie_Hellman">OpenSSL</a> Hard to tell. Their intuitive explanation leaves it out, but they have details below and code that might have it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I looked at a few more but it was the same story.<br />
<br />
This is NOT a RANT or even a complaint, but its a question:<br />
<br />
<b>Why do so few expositions of DH mention how to find p,g? You really need to do that if you really want to DO DH.</b><br />
<b><br /></b>
Speculation<br />
<br />
1) Some of the above are for the laymen and hence can not get into that. But some are not.<br />
<br />
2) Some of them are for advanced audiences who would know how to do it. Even so, how to find the generator really needs to be mentioned.<br />
<br />
3) Goldilocks: Some papers are for the layman who would not notice the gap, and some papers are for the expert who can fill in the gap themselves, so no paper in between. I do not believe that.<br />
<br />
4) The oddest of the above is that the original paper did not say how to find g.<br />
<br />

<p>One of the difficulties of extending results from finite graphs to infinite ones is that it is not always obvious how to extend the definitions. A single class of finite graphs may correspond, in the infinite graph world, to several different natural classes of infinite graphs. One of the ways this can happen is through orderings: if a class of graphs has a natural ordering on its vertices (say, through a construction in which graphs in this class are built up by adding one vertex at a time) then we might get several classes of infinite graphs with different ways of restricting or not restricting this vertex ordering.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/threshold.svg" alt="Threshold graph" /></p>

<p>As an example of this phenomenon, consider the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_graph">threshold graphs</a>, one of the simplest classes of finite graphs. An example is shown above. These can be defined in multiple equivalent ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The finite threshold graphs are the graphs that can be built up by repeatedly adding either a universal vertex or an isolated vertex to a smaller graph. In the example, the vertices have been added in left-to-right order, with isolated vertices depicted in yellow and universal vertices in blue. This can be formalized in a way that extends to infinite graphs by saying that they are the graphs in which every nonempty induced subgraph contains either a universal vertex or an isolated vertex. Let’s call these graphs the “inductive threshold graphs”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can also construct graphs in the reverse ordering, by repeatedly adding a vertex whose neighbors form a clique and whose non-neighbors form an independent set. More concisely, the vertex is both simplicial and cosimplicial. The example above can be constructed in this way by adding the vertices in right-to-left order, with the blue neighbors of each added vertex forming a clique and the yellow neighbors forming an independent set. This can be formalized in a way that extends to infinite graphs by requiring that every induced subgraph has a vertex that is simplicial and cosimplicial. Let’s call a graph with this property a “coinductive threshold graph”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The finite threshold graphs are the -free finite graphs, meaning that no four vertices form an induced subgraph that is a path, cycle, or perfect matching.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The finite threshold graphs get their name from the following property: they are the graphs that we can generate by assigning weights in the interval  to the vertices and connecting two vertices by an edge whenever their sum of weights is at least one. Let’s call a graph with this property a “real threshold graph”.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All four of these properties are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_property">hereditary</a>: if a graph has the property, so do all its induced subgraphs. Because the three forbidden subgraphs , , and  have no universal or isolated vertex, have no simplicial and cosimplicial vertex, and have no valid weight assignment, the inductive threshold graphs, coinductive threshold graphs, and real threshold graphs are all subclasses of the -free graphs.</p>

<p>If a graph is -free, we can define a relation  on its vertices by saying that  if there is no vertex  with  forming an induced path or complement of a path. It follows from the nonexistence of the forbidden subgraphs that this is a total preorder, that every vertex  is universal or isolated among the vertices , and that every vertex  is simplicial and cosimplicial among the vertices . In the example above, two vertices are in the same equivalence class of the ordering if they are in a contiguous block of vertices with the same color, and otherwise their ordering according to  is the same as their left-to-right ordering. Because every finite total preorder has a minimal and a maximal element, every finite -free graph is an inductive threshold graph and a coinductive threshold graph.</p>

<p>However, these properties differ for infinite graphs. In an infinite inductive threshold graph, the total preorder must obey the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascending_chain_condition">ascending chain condition</a> that there be no strictly-increasing infinite sequence of vertices, for the subgraph induced by the vertices of such a sequence would have no isolated or universal vertex. Conversely, if the order does obey the ascending chain condition, one could find an isolated or universal vertex in any subgraph by starting from an arbitrary vertex and repeatedly moving upwards in the order until getting stuck. So the inductive threshold graphs are exactly the ones whose order obeys the ascending chain condition. Similarly, the coinductive threshold graphs are exactly the ones whose order obeys the descending chain condition. But it is easy to construct orders that violate one or both of these conditions. A graph can only be a real threshold graph if the total order on the equivalence classes of its preorder can be embedded into , and again this is not true of all total orders.</p>

<p>One consequence of this difference between classes of infinite graphs is the construction of natural statements in the first-order <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_of_graphs">logic of graphs</a> that are true for all finite graphs but untrue for some infinite graphs. For instance, the statements that a -free graph has an isolated or universal vertex, and that a -free graph has a simplicial and cosimplicial vertex, are both true of all finite graphs, but untrue of some infinite graphs.</p>

Equivalence testing for a polynomial family $\{g_m\}_{m \in \mathbb{N}}$ over a field F is the following problem: Given black-box access to an $n$-variate polynomial $f(\mathbb{x})$, where $n$ is the number of variables in $g_m$ for some $m \in \mathbb{N}$, check if there exists an $A \in \text{GL}(n,\text{F})$ such that $f(\mathbb{x}) = g_m(A\mathbb{x})$. If yes, then output such an $A$. The complexity of equivalence testing has been studied for a number of important polynomial families, including the determinant (Det) and the family of iterated matrix multiplication polynomials. Two popular variants of the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial are: IMM$_{w,d}$ (the $(1,1)$ entry of the product of $d$ many $w\times w$  symbolic matrices) and Tr-IMM$_{w,d}$ (the trace of the product of $d$ many $w\times w$ symbolic matrices). The families - Det, IMM and Tr-IMM - are VBP-complete under $p$-projections, and so, in this sense, they have the same complexity. But, do they have the same equivalence testing complexity? We show that the answer is 'yes' for Det and Tr-IMM (modulo the use of randomness). 

The above result may appear a bit surprising as the complexity of equivalence testing for IMM and that for Det are quite different over rationals: a randomized polynomial-time equivalence testing for IMM over rationals is known [Kayal,Nair,Saha,Tavenas 2019], whereas [Garg,Gupta,Kayal,Saha 2019] showed that equivalence testing for Det over rationals is integer factoring hard (under randomized reductions and assuming GRH). To our knowledge, the complexity of equivalence testing for Tr-IMM was not known before this work. We show that, despite the syntactic similarity between IMM and Tr-IMM, equivalence testing for Tr-IMM and that for Det are randomized polynomial-time Turing reducible to each other over any field of characteristic zero or sufficiently large. The result is obtained by connecting the two problems via another well-studied problem in computer algebra, namely the full matrix algebra isomorphism problem (FMAI). In particular, we prove the following: 

1.Testing equivalence of polynomials to Tr-IMM$_{w,d}$, for $d\geq 3$ and $w\geq 2$, is randomized polynomial-time Turing reducible to testing equivalence of polynomials to Det$_w$, the determinant of the $w \times w$ matrix of formal variables. (Here, $d$ need not be a constant.)

2. FMAI is randomized polynomial-time Turing reducible to equivalence testing (in fact, to tensor isomorphism testing) for the family of matrix multiplication tensors $\{$Tr-IMM$_{w,3}\}_{w \in \mathbb{N}}$.

These results, in conjunction with the randomized poly-time reduction (shown in [GGKS19]) from determinant equivalence testing to FMAI, imply that the four problems - FMAI, equivalence testing for Tr-IMM and for Det, and the $3$-tensor isomorphism problem for the family of matrix multiplication tensors - are randomized poly-time equivalent under Turing reductions.</div>

<em>Proofs and perpetual motion machines</em><br />
<font color="#000000"></font></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/picture.png"><img width="200" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/picture.png?w=200&amp;h=150" class="alignright  wp-image-17193" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>
Leonardo da Vinci is, of course, famous for his paintings and drawings, but was also interested in inventions, and in various parts of science including mathematics and engineering. It is hard to imagine that he died over 500 years ago, given his continued impact on our world. He invented practical and impractical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci">inventions</a>: musical instruments, a mechanical knight, hydraulic pumps, reversible crank mechanisms, finned mortar shells, and a steam cannon.</p>
<p>
Today I wish to discuss proofs and perpetual motion machines.</p>
<p>
You might ask: <i>What do proofs and perpetual motion machines have in common?</i> Proofs refer to math proofs that claim to solve open problems like P <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cneq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\neq}" class="latex" title="{\neq}" /> NP. Ken and I get such claims all time. I take a look at them, not because I think they are likely to be correct. Rather because I am interested in understanding how people think. </p>
<p>
I started to work on discussing such proofs when I realized that such “proofs” are related to claims about perpetual motion machines. Let’s see how.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Perpetual Motion Machines </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
A perpetual motion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_motion">machine</a> is a machine that operates indefinitely without an energy source. This kind of machine is impossible, as da Vinci knew already:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Oh ye seekers after perpetual motion, how many vain chimeras have you pursued? Go and take your place with the alchemists. <br />
—da Vinci, 1494 </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
I like this statement about applying for US patents on such machines: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Proposals for such inoperable machines have become so common that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has made an official policy of refusing to grant patents for perpetual motion machines without a working model. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Here is a classic attempt at perpetual motion: The motion goes on “forever” since the right side floats up and the left side falls down. </p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/float.png"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/float.png?w=600" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17194" /></a></p>
<p>
The analogy of proofs and to perpetual motion machines is: The debunking such a machine is not done by looking carefully at each gear and lever to see why the machine fails to work. Rather is done like this: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Your machine violates the fundamental laws of thermodynamics and is thus impossible. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Candidate machines are not studied to find the exact flaw in their design. The force of fundamental laws allows a sweeping, simple, and powerful argument against them. There are similar ideas in checking a proof. Let’s take a look at them.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Proofs </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Claims are made about proofs of open problems all the time. Often these are made for solutions to famous open problems, like P<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cneq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\neq}" class="latex" title="{\neq}" />NP or the Riemann Hypothesis (RH).</p>
<p>
Math proofs are used to try to get to the <i>truth</i>. As we said <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/04/24/why-check-a-proof/">before</a> proofs are only as good as the assumptions made and the rules invoked. The beauty of the proof concept is that arguments can be checked, even long and complex ones. If the assumptions and the rules are correct, then no matter how strange the conclusion is, it must be true.</p>
<p>
For <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2949/which-one-result-in-mathematics-has-surprised-you-the-most">example</a>:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> The Riemann rearrangement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ri emann_series_theorem#Statement_of_the_theorem">theorem</a>. A sum 	</p>

<p>that is conditionally convergent can be reordered to yield any number. Thus there is series 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++b_%7B1%7D+%2B+b_%7B2%7D+%2B+b_%7B3%7D+%2B+%5Cdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  b_{1} + b_{2} + b_{3} + \dots " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  b_{1} + b_{2} + b_{3} + \dots " /></p>
<p>that sums conditionally to your favorite number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M}" class="latex" title="{M}" /> and yet the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb_%7B1%7D%2Cb_%7B2%7D%2C%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b_{1},b_{2},\dots}" class="latex" title="{b_{1},b_{2},\dots}" /> is just a arrangement of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba_%7B1%7D%2Ca_%7B2%7D%2C%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a_{1},a_{2},\dots}" class="latex" title="{a_{1},a_{2},\dots}" />. This says that addition is not commutative for infinite series.</p>

<p></p><p><br />
The point of a proof is that it is a series of small steps. If each step is correct, then the whole is correct. But in practice proofs are often checked in other ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Checking Proofs </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The starting point for my thoughts—joined here with Ken’s—are these two issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>
A proof that <em>only</em> has many small steps but no global picture is hard to motivate. <p></p>
</li><li>
A proof with complex logic at the high level is hard to understand.
</li></ol>
<p>
Note that a deep, hard theorem can still have straightforward logic. A famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis#Littlewood's_theorem">theorem</a> of Littlewood has for its proof the structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Case the RH is false: Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /> <p></p>
</li><li>
Case the RH is true: Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" />
</li></ul>
<p>
The RH-false case takes under a page. The benefit with this logic is that one gets to assume RH for the rest. The strategy for the famous proof by Andrew Wiles of Fermat’s Last Theorem (FLT)—incorporating the all-important fix by Richard Taylor—has this structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>
If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" />. <p></p>
</li><li>
If not-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" />. <p></p>
</li><li>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> implies FLT. <p></p>
</li><li>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" /> implies FLT.
</li></ul>
<p>
Wiles had done the last step long before but had put aside since he didn’t know how to get <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" />. The key was framing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> so that it enabled bridged the gap in his originally-announced proof while its negation enabled the older proof.</p>
<p>
Thus what we should seek are proofs with simple logic at the high level that breaks into cases or into sequential sub-goals so that the proof is a chain or relatively few of those goals. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Shapes and Barriers </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
This makes Ken and I think again about an old <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.73.7682">paper</a> by Juris Hartmanis with his students Richard Chang, Desh Ranjan, and Pankaj Rohatgi in the May 1990 <em>Bulletin of the EATCS</em> titled, “On IP=PSPACE and Theorems With Narrow Proofs.” Ken’s <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/05/17/the-shapes-of-computations/">post</a> on it included this nice diagram of what the paper calls “shapes of proofs”:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/proofshapes.png"><img width="400" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/proofshapes.png?w=400&amp;h=252" class="aligncenter  wp-image-17197" height="252" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
Ken’s thought now is that this taxonomy needs to be augmented with a proof shape corresponding to certain classes believed to be properly below polynomial time—classes within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NC_(complexity)">NC</a> hierarchy. Those proofs branch at the top into manageable-size subcases, and/or have a limited number of sequential stages, where each stage may be wide but is shallow in its chains of dependencies. Call this shape a “macro-tree.”</p>
<p>
The difference between the macro-tree shape and the sequential shapes pictured above is neatly captured by Ashley Ahlin on a <a href="http://www.math.wichita.edu/~pparker/classes/thms.htm">page</a> about “Reading Theorems”:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Note that, in some ways, the easiest way to read a proof is to check that each step follows from the previous ones. This is a bit like following a game of chess by checking to see that each move was legal, or like running a spell-checker on an essay. It’s important, and necessary, but it’s not really the point. … The problem with this is that you are unlikely to remember anything about how to prove the theorem, if you’ve only read in this manner. Once you’re read a theorem and its proof, you can go back and ask some questions to help synthesize your understanding. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The other high-level structure that a proof needs to make evident—before seeing it is reasonable to expend the effort to check it—is shaped by <em>barriers</em>. We have <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/barriers-to-pnp-proofs/">touched</a> on <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/03/13/no-go-theorems/">this</a> topic <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/03/25/whos-afraid-of-natural-proofs/">several</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/04/18/a-reason-why-circuit-lower-bounds-are-hard/">times</a> but maybe have not stated it full on for P versus NP. A recent <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~liyang/teaching/projects/formal-barriers-to-proving-P-ne-NP.pdf">essay</a> for a course led by Li-Yang Tan at Stanford does so in just a few pages. A proof should state up front how it works around barriers, and this alone makes its strategy easier to follow.</p>
<p>
The idea of barriers extends outside P versus NP, of course. Peter Scholze seems to be invoking it in a <a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=11709&amp;cpage=1#comment-235940">comment</a> two months ago in a <a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=11709">post</a> by Peter Woit in April on the status of Shinichi Mochizuki’s claimed proof of the ABC conjecture:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> I may have not expressed this clearly enough in my manuscript with Stix, but there is just no way that anything like what Mochizuki does can work. … The reason it cannot work is a[nother] theorem of Mochizuki himself. … If the above claims [which are negated by the theorem] would have been true, I would see how Mochizuki’s strategy might have a nonzero chance of succeeding. … </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Thus what Ken and I conclude is that in order for a proof to be checkable <em>chunk by chunk</em>—not line by line—it needs to have:</p>
<ol>
<li>
A top-level decomposition into a relatively small number of components and stages—like legs in a sailing race—and <p></p>
</li><li>
A demonstration of how the stages navigate around known barriers.
</li></ol>
<p>
Lack of a clear plan in the first already says the proof attempt cannot avoid being snagged on a barrier, as surely as natural laws prevent building a perpetual-motion machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Does this help in ascertaining what shape a proof that resolves the P versus NP problem must have?</p>

<p>The convergence of research interests of computer scientists and economic theorists has been a remarkable development, and JET would like to do more to help facilitate the exchange of ideas across fields. Therefore, we compile here some suggestions for computer scientists who are interested in submitting their work to JET.</p>
<p>The basic standard for a publication in JET is that the paper should be original, make a substantial contribution, and be of interest to a broad group of readers, and this group should include economic theorists. Of course, editors make subjective, and fallible, judgments when assessing whether a paper meets these criteria. Typically, the substantive contribution is a contribution to economic theory, i.e. to our understanding of models of markets, strategic games, mechanisms, etc. Papers may be computer-science centric in its contributions, but then these contributions should be on a topic of interest to economists. For example, new algorithmic results related to game theory or mechanism design may be of interest to JET, if it is the editors’ judgment that these algorithms will be of interest to economists. On the other hand, results on more applied computational problems, such as faster algorithms for winner determination in auctions, or for clearing prediction markets, may be out of scope for JET.</p>
<p>In terms of style, successful JET submissions include an introduction that is accessible to a broad theory audience, and that explains the motivation for the work, overviews the main results, and explains some key intuitions. The introduction, or a separate literature review section, should precisely situate the work relative to the most closely related research. The main body of the paper should explain the model rigorously, and state the results precisely. Proofs which are not very long, and which provide insight, are typically included in the main body of the paper, whereas other proofs are moved to an appendix. It is often useful to paraphrase results in words after stating them formally, and to give explanations of intuitions as well as explanations of proof structures. We encourage authors to make their work as simple as is possible without losing the main message.</p>
<p>There is no length limit per se, but published papers have rarely more than 40 pages, including appendix and references, in print. We value conciseness, and focus on a main theme throughout the paper. Minor results can be left out. On the other hand, we do provide authors with the space needed to be precise and clear.</p>
<p>One general recommendation for computer science authors in preparing manuscripts for economics journals is to have an economist colleague look over the paper before submitting.  This is a good way to identify inaccurate assumptions about readers’ knowledge, or omitted relationships to the prior literature in economics.  Such advice can also help better motivate the results of the paper from an economic perspective.</p>
<p>To be publishable, if an earlier version of a paper was published as an extended abstract in conference proceedings, then the journal version must make additional contributions beyond the conference version.  This additional contribution may include important conceptual aspects of economic interest that were omitted from the original extended abstract, proofs that were omitted from the extended abstract, and additional results that did not appear in the extended abstract. Authors should explain the differences between the conference version and the journal version in a cover letter. Papers that have previously appeared as one or two page abstracts in a conference volume do not need to distinguish themselves.  Mentioning these appearances in a cover letter would useful, however.</p></div>

<p>It’s been an unusually challenging year for both sides of the TCS job market with some unexpected obstacles and delays. Apologies for putting up the spreadsheet later than usual and congrats to both sides in each converged process!</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kzq4xVyU1k5CUTrV0yjIgzqlcv8agZqN_jiVlbYJb9g/edit?usp=sharing">Here is a link</a> to a crowdsourced spreadsheet created to collect information about theory jobs this year. 
I put in a biased pseudorandom seed, please help populate and share!
Rules for the spreadsheet have been copied from previous years (with one substantial suggestion regarding senior hires based on one of my friends’ recommendation, see below) and all edits to the document are anonymized. Please, post a comment if you have any suggestions about the rules.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Separate sheets for faculty, industry and postdocs/visitors. </li>
 <li>People should be connected to theoretical computer science, broadly defined.</li>
 <li>Only add jobs that you are absolutely sure have been offered and accepted. This is not the place for speculation and rumors. <b>New:</b> Please, be particularly careful when adding senior hires (people who already have an academic or industrial job) -- end dates of their current positions might be still in the future. </li>
 <li>You are welcome to add yourself, or people your department has hired. </li>
</ul>
