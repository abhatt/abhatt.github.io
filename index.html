architectures. Durable concurrent data structures for non-volatile memories are
essential building blocks for constructing adequate software for use with these
architectures. In this paper, we propose a new approach for durable concurrent
sets and use this approach to build the most efficient durable hash tables
available today. Evaluation shows a performance improvement factor of up to
3.3x over existing technology.

Orange since 2016. The goal is to place $2 \times 1$ dominoes on a grid layout,
and get a better score than other players. Each $1 \times 1$ domino cell has a
color that must match at least one adjacent cell, and an integer number of
crowns (possibly none) used to compute the score. We prove that even with full
knowledge of the future of the game, in order to maximize their score at
Kingdomino, players are faced with an NP-complete optimization problem.

$T$ if $u$ occurs exactly once in $T$ and any proper substring of $u$ occurs at
least twice in $T$. A string $w$ is called a minimal absent word~(MAW) of $T$
if $w$ does not occur in $T$ and any proper substring of $w$ occurs in $T$. In
this paper, we study the problems of computing MUSs and MAWs in a sliding
window over a given string $T$. We first show how the set of MUSs can change in
a sliding window over $T$, and present an $O(n\log\sigma)$-time and
$O(d)$-space algorithm to compute MUSs in a sliding window of width $d$ over
$T$, where $\sigma$ is the maximum number of distinct characters in every
window. We then give tight upper and lower bounds on the maximum number of
changes in the set of MAWs in a sliding window over $T$. Our bounds improve on
the previous results in [Crochemore et al., 2017].

are well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. A feasible RCPSP
solution consists of a time-ordered schedule of jobs with corresponding
execution modes, respecting precedence and resources constraints. In this
paper, we propose a cutting plane algorithm to separate five different cut
families, as well as a new preprocessing routine to strengthen resource-related
constraints. New lifted versions of the well-known precedence and cover
inequalities are employed. At each iteration, a dense conflict graph is built
considering feasibility and optimality conditions to separate cliques,
odd-holes and strengthened Chv\'atal-Gomory cuts. The proposed strategies
considerably improve the linear relaxation bounds, allowing a state-of-the-art
mixed-integer linear programming solver to find provably optimal solutions for
754 previously open instances of different variants of the RCPSPs, which was
not possible using the original linear programming formulations.

databases, due to its potential to significantly reduce resource usage and
response times, at the cost of a small approximation error. We consider random
sampling for answering the ubiquitous class of group-by queries, which first
group data according to one or more attributes, and then aggregate within each
group after filtering through a predicate. The challenge with group-by queries
is that a sampling method cannot focus on optimizing the quality of a single
answer (e.g. the mean of selected data), but must simultaneously optimize the
quality of a set of answers (one per group).
</p>
<p>We present CVOPT, a query- and data-driven sampling framework for a set of
queries that return multiple answers, e.g. group-by queries. To evaluate the
quality of a sample, CVOPT defines a metric based on the norm of the
coefficients of variation (CVs) of different answers, and constructs a
stratified sample that provably optimizes the metric. CVOPT can handle group-by
queries on data where groups have vastly different statistical characteristics,
such as frequencies, means, or variances. CVOPT jointly optimizes for multiple
aggregations and multiple group-by clauses, and provides a way to prioritize
specific groups or aggregates. It can be tuned to cases when partial
information about a query workload is known, such as a data warehouse where
queries are scheduled to run periodically.
</p>
<p>Our experimental results show that CVOPT outperforms current state-of-the-art
on sample quality and estimation accuracy for group-by queries. On a set of
queries on two real-world data sets, CVOPT yields relative errors that are 5
times smaller than competing approaches, under the same budget.

Jeffrey Shallit is a famous researcher into many things, including number theory and being a skeptic. He has a colorful website with an extensive quotation <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/quotes.html">page</a>—one of my favorites by Howard Aiken is right at the top:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Don’t worry about people stealing an idea. If it’s original, you will have to ram it down their throats. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Today I thought I would discuss a wonderful problem that Jeffrey has worked on.</p>
<p>
Jeffrey’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.4513">paper</a> is joint with Erik Demaine, Sarah Eisenstat, and David Wilson. See also his <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/Talks/bc4.pdf">talk</a>. They say in their introduction:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Imagine a computing device with very limited powers. What is the simplest computational problem you could ask it to solve? It is not the addition of two numbers, nor sorting, nor string matching—it is telling two inputs apart: distinguishing them in some way. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
More formally: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> be two distinct <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> long strings over the usual binary alphabet. What is the size of the smallest deterministic automaton <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M}" class="latex" title="{M}" /> that can accept one of the strings and reject the other? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
That is, how hard is it for a simple type of machine to tell <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> apart from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />? There is no super cool name for the question—it is called the <i>Separating Words Problem</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separating_words_problem">SWP</a>). </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Some History </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Pavel Goral&amp;ccaron;ik and Vaclav Koubek introduced the problem in 1986—see their paper <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-16761-7_61">here</a>. Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> are distinct binary words of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />. Define <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf%7BSEP%7D%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bf{SEP}(x,y)}" class="latex" title="{\bf{SEP}(x,y)}" /> to be the number of states of the smallest automaton that accepts <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> and rejects <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> or vice-versa. They proved the result that got people interested:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> For all distinct binary words <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />, 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%7B%5Cbf+SEP%7D%28x%2Cy%29+%3Do%28n%29.+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  {\bf SEP}(x,y) =o(n). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  {\bf SEP}(x,y) =o(n). " /></p>
</em><p><em></em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>That is the size of the automaton is asymptotically sub-linear. Of course there is trivially a way to tell the words apart with order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> states. The surprise is that one can do better, always.</p>
<p>
In 1989 John Robson obtained the best known result: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 2</b> <em> For all distinct binary words <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />, 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%7B%5Cbf+SEP%7D%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+O%28n%5E%7B2%2F5%7D%28%5Clog+n%29%5E%7B3%2F5%7D%29.+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  {\bf SEP}(x,y) = O(n^{2/5}(\log n)^{3/5}). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  {\bf SEP}(x,y) = O(n^{2/5}(\log n)^{3/5}). " /></p>
</em><p><em></em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
This bound is pretty strange. We rarely see bounds like it. This suggest to me that it is either special or it is not optimal. Not clear which is the case. By the way it is also known that there are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> so that </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%7B%5Cbf+SEP%7D%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+%5COmega%28%5Clog+n%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  {\bf SEP}(x,y) = \Omega(\log n). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  {\bf SEP}(x,y) = \Omega(\log n). " /></p>
<p>Thus there is an exponential gap between the known lower and upper bounds. Welcome to complexity theory.</p>
<p>
What heightens interest in this gap is that whenever the words have different lengths, there is always a logarithmic-size automaton that separates them. The reason is our old friend, the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Simply, if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm+%3C+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m &lt; n}" class="latex" title="{m &lt; n}" /> there is always a short prime <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" /> that does not divide <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+-+m%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n - m}" class="latex" title="{n - m}" />, which means that the DFA that goes in a cycle of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" /> will end in a different state on any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m}" class="latex" title="{m}" /> from the state on any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />. Moreover, the strings <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%5Em%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0^m}" class="latex" title="{0^m}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%5EN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0^N}" class="latex" title="{0^N}" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" /> equals <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m}" class="latex" title="{m}" /> plus the least common multiple of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2C%5Cdots%2Cm%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1,\dots,m+1}" class="latex" title="{1,\dots,m+1}" /> require <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5COmega%28%5Clog+N%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\Omega(\log N)}" class="latex" title="{\Omega(\log N)}" /> states to separate. Padding these with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />s gives equal-length pairs of all lengths <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> giving <b>SEP</b>(x,y)<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csim+%5Clog+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sim \log n}" class="latex" title="{\sim \log n}" />.</p>
<p>
Some other facts about SWP can be found in the paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>
(a) It does not matter whether the alphabet is binary or larger. <p></p>
</li><li>
(b) For random distinct <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x,y}" class="latex" title="{x,y}" />, the expected number of states needed to separate them is at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{4}" class="latex" title="{4}" />. <p></p>
</li><li>
(c) All length-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> pairs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x,y}" class="latex" title="{x,y}" /> can be distinguished by deterministic pushdown automata (with two-way input tape) of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(\log n)}" class="latex" title="{O(\log n)}" />.
</li></ul>
<p>
Point (b) underscores why it has been hard to find “bad pairs” that defeat all small DFAs. All this promotes belief that logarithmic is the true upper bound as well. Jeffrey stopped short of calling this a conjecture in his talk, but he did offer a 100-pound prize (the talk was in Britain) for improving Robson’s bound. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Some Questions </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
There are many partial results in cases where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> are restricted in some way. See the papers for details. I thought I would just repeat a couple of interesting open cases.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> How hard is it to tell words from their reversal? That is, if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> is a word can we prove a better bound on 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%7B%5Cbf+SEP%7D%28x%2Cx%5E%7BR%7D%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  {\bf SEP}(x,x^{R}). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  {\bf SEP}(x,x^{R}). " /></p>
<p>Recall <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5E%7BR%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x^{R}}" class="latex" title="{x^{R}}" /> is the reversal of the word <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{w}" class="latex" title="{w}" />. Of course we assume that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> is not the same as its reversal—that is, we assume that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> is not a palindrome.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> How hard is it to tell words apart from their cyclic shifts?</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> How hard is it to tell words from their <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /> You get the idea: try other operations on words. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The SWP is a neat question in my opinion. I wonder if there would be some interesting consequence if we could always tell two words apart with few states. The good measure of a conjecture is: how many consequences are there that follow from it? I wonder if there could be some interesting applications. What do you think?</p>

The following multi-determinantal algebraic variety plays a central role in algebra, algebraic geometry and computational complexity theory: ${\rm SING}_{n,m}$, consisting of all $m$-tuples of $n\times n$ complex matrices which span only singular matrices. In particular, an efficient deterministic algorithm testing membership in ${\rm SING}_{n,m}$ will imply super-polynomial circuit lower bounds, a holy grail of the theory of computation.
  A sequence of recent works suggests such efficient algorithms for memberships in a general class of algebraic varieties, namely the null cones of linear group actions. Can this be used for the problem above? Our main result is negative: ${\rm SING}_{n,m}$ is not the null cone of any (reductive) group action! This stands in stark contrast to a non-commutative analog of this variety, and points to an inherent structural difficulty of ${\rm SING}_{n,m}$.
  To prove this result we identify precisely the group of symmetries of ${\rm SING}_{n,m}$. We find this characterization, and the tools we introduce to prove it, of independent interest. Our work significantly generalizes a result of Frobenius for the special case $m=1$, and suggests a general method for determining the symmetries of algebraic varieties.</div>

tuples of strings known as \textit{multi-track strings}. Multi-track strings
are a generalisation of strings (or \textit{single-track strings}) that have
primarily found uses in problems related to searching multiple genomes and
music information retrieval
\cite{Lemstrom:2003:MPS:175<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/6553.17565">6553.17565</a>71,Lemstrom:2003:TIP:96<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/7792.96779">7792.96779</a>3}. There
is a \textit{full-permuted-match} between two multi-track strings if given two
multi-track strings (multi-sets of strings) $\mathcal{T} = (t_1, t_2,\ldots ,
t_N)$ and $ \mathcal{P} = (p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_N)$ such that $| p_1 | = | p_2 |
= \ldots = | p_N | = | t_1 | = | t_2 | = \ldots = | t_N |$, then there is a
full-permuted-match between $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ if $\mathcal{P} =
(t_{r_1}, t_{r_2},\ldots , t_{r_n})$ for some permutation $(r_1,\ldots,r_N)$ of
$(1,\ldots,N)$, we denote this $\mathcal{P}\asymp\mathcal{T}$.
</p>
<p>Efficient algorithms for some full-permuted match problems on multi-track
strings have recently been presented
\cite{Hendrian_2019,PSC2016-2,10.1007/978-3-642-35843-2_25}. In this paper we
show a reduction from multi-track strings of length $n$ with alphabet size
$\sigma_U$ to single-track strings of length $2n-1$ with alphabet size
$\sigma_U^N$. Through this reduction we allow any string matching algorithm to
be used on multi-track string problems using $\asymp$ as the match relation.

in flow fields where the FIFO (first-in-first-out) assumption is violated. This
problem variant is important for autonomous vehicles in the ocean, for example,
that cannot arbitrarily hover in a fixed position and that are strongly
influenced by time-varying ocean currents. Although polynomial-time solutions
are available for discrete-time problems, the continuous-time non-FIFO case is
NP-hard with no known relevant special cases. Our main result is to show that
this problem can be solved in polynomial time if the edge travel time functions
are piecewise-constant, agreeing with existing worst-case bounds for FIFO
problems with restricted slopes. We present a minimum-time algorithm for graphs
that allows for paths with finite-length cycles, and then embed this algorithm
within an asymptotically optimal sampling-based framework to find time-optimal
paths in flows. The algorithm relies on an efficient data structure to
represent and manipulate piecewise-constant functions and is straightforward to
implement. We illustrate the behaviour of the algorithm in an example based on
a common ocean vortex model in addition to simpler graph-based examples.

manufacturing (3D printing), is widely known for its capability of programming
post-fabrication shape-changing into artifacts. Fused deposition modeling
(FDM)-based 4D printing, in particular, uses thermoplastics to produce
artifacts and requires computational analysis to assist the design processes of
complex geometries. However, these artifacts are weak against structural loads,
and the design quality can be limited by less accurate material models and
numerical simulations. To address these issues, this paper propounds a
composite structure design made of two materials - polylactic acid (PLA) and
carbon fiber reinforced PLA (CFPLA) - to increase the structural strength of 4D
printed artifacts and a workflow composed of several physical experiments and
series of dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) to characterize materials. We apply
this workflow to 3D printed samples fabricated with different printed
parameters to accurately characterize the materials and implement a sequential
finite element analysis (FEA) to achieve accurate simulations. The accuracy of
our method is both computationally and experimentally verified with several
creative design examples and is measured to be at least 95\%. We believe the
presented workflow is essential to the combination of geometry, material
mechanism and design, and has various potential applications.

Problem of linear codes over $\mathbb F_2$, which can be stated as follows:
given a generator matrix $\mathbf A$ and an integer $k$, determine whether the
code generated by $\mathbf A$ has distance at most $k$, or in other words,
whether there is a nonzero vector $\mathbf{x}$ such that $\mathbf A \mathbf{x}$
has at most $k$ nonzero coordinates. The question of whether $k$-Even Set is
fixed parameter tractable (FPT) parameterized by the distance $k$ has been
repeatedly raised in literature; in fact, it is one of the few remaining open
questions from the seminal book of Downey and Fellows (1999). In this work, we
show that $k$-Even Set is W[1]-hard under randomized reductions. We also
consider the parameterized $k$-Shortest Vector Problem (SVP), in which we are
given a lattice whose basis vectors are integral and an integer $k$, and the
goal is to determine whether the norm of the shortest vector (in the $\ell_p$
norm for some fixed $p$) is at most $k$. Similar to $k$-Even Set, understanding
the complexity of this problem is also a long-standing open question in the
field of Parameterized Complexity. We show that, for any $p &gt; 1$, $k$-SVP is
W[1]-hard to approximate (under randomized reductions) to some constant factor.

I'm shortly hopping on a plane to head to ALGO/ESA.  I'll be giving a survey-ish talk on Learning Augmented Algorithms, covering my work so far in the area as well as some of the work by others.  I think it's a highly promising direction fitting in the framework of Beyond Worst Case Analysis, so I'm excited to give the talk, and hoping it's still a novel enough area to be new to most of the audience. <br /><br />For those of you who are there, feel free to say hi -- I'm looking forward to talking to people. <br /><br /><br /></div>

<p>Dana and I are searching for a live-in nanny for our two kids, Lily (age 6) and Daniel (age 2).  We can offer $750/week.  We can also offer a private room with a full bathroom and a beautiful view in our home in central Austin, TX, as well as free food and other amenities.  The responsibilities include helping to take the kids to and from school and drive them to various activities, helping to get them ready for school/daycare in the morning and ready for sleep at night, cooking and other housework.  We’d ask for no more than 45 hours per week, and could give several days off at a time depending on scheduling constraints.</p>



<p>If interested, please shoot me an email, tell me all about yourself and provide references.</p>



<p>Obviously, feel free to let anyone else know who you think might be interested (but who might not read this blog).</p>

You may have noticed, or not, that I haven't posted or tweeted much in the last month. I've had a busy time moving back to Chicago and starting my new position as Dean of the College of Science at Illinois Tech.<br />
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Part of that trip involved driving my electric Chevy Bolt from Atlanta to Chicago. You can do it, but it got a bit nerve wracking. There is only one high-speed charging station between Indianapolis and Chicago and you pray the charger outside the Lafayette Walmart actually works (it did). We passed many Tesla charging superstations, I will have to admit they have the better network. </div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Theoremwise, Ryan Alweiss, Shachar Lovett, Kewen Wu and Jiapeng Zhang had <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/08/23/amazing-ryan-alweiss-shachar-lovett-kewen-wu-jiapeng-zhang-made-dramatic-progress-on-the-sunflower-conjecture/">significant improvements on the sunflower conjecture</a>. I posted on the sunflower theorem for Richard Rado's <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2006/04/richard-rado-1906-1989.html">centenary</a>. Nice to see there is still some give in it.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
I probably will post less often in this new position. Bill asked me "Why is being a dean (or maybe its just the move) more time then being a chair? Were you this busy when you moved and first became chair?"<br />
<br />
When I moved to Atlanta, I moved a year ahead of the rest of the family and rented a condo. We had plenty of time to search for a house in Atlanta and plan the move. Here it all happened in a much more compressed time schedule and, since we've bought a condo, into a much more compressed space.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Being a chair certainly ate up plenty of time but it feels different as dean with a more external focus. I won't give up the blog but you'll probably hear a lot more from Bill than from me at least in the near future.</div></div>

Instance complexity is a measure of goodness of an algorithm in which the performance of one algorithm is compared to others per input. This is in sharp contrast to worst-case and average-case complexity measures, where the performance is compared either on the worst input or on an average one, respectively.

  We initiate the systematic study of instance complexity and optimality in the query model (a.k.a. the decision tree model). In this model, instance optimality of an algorithm for computing a function is the requirement that the complexity of an algorithm on any input is at most a constant factor larger than the complexity of the best correct algorithm. That is we compare the decision tree to one that receives a certificate and its complexity is measured only if the certificate is correct (but correctness should hold on any input).  We study both deterministic and randomized decision trees and provide various characterizations and barriers for more general results.

  We introduce a new measure of complexity called unlabeled-certificate complexity, appropriate for graph properties and other functions with symmetries, where information about the structure of the graph is given as a certificate, but not labels of individual vertices. More precisely, the certificate is some permutation of the input (rather than the input itself) and the correctness should be maintained even if the certificate is wrong. We study both worst case complexity and instance optimality with respect to this measure of complexity. In this setting an algorithm is said to be instance optimal if for every input it performs roughly as well as the best algorithm that is given an unlabeled certificate (but is correct on every input).  We show that instance optimality depends on the group of permutations in consideration. Our proofs rely on techniques from hypothesis testing and analysis of random graphs.</div>

<p>A comparatively slow month, as summer draws to a close: we found three papers online. Please let us know if we missed any!</p>



<p><strong>Testing convexity of functions over finite domains</strong>, by Aleksandrs Belovs, Eric Blais, and Abhinav Bommireddi (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/092/">arXiv</a>). This paper studies the classic problem of convexity testing, and proves a number of interesting results on the adaptive and non-adaptive complexity of this problem in single- and multi-dimensional settings. In the single-dimensional setting on domain \([n]\), they show that adaptivity doesn’t help: the complexity will be \(O(\log n)\) in both cases. However, in the simplest two-dimensional setting, a domain of \([3] \times [n]\), they give a polylogarithmic upper bound in the adaptive setting, but a polynomial lower bound in the non-adaptive setting, showing a strong separation. Finally, they provide a lower bound for \([n]^d\) which scales exponentially in the dimension. This leaves open the tantalizing open question: is it possible to avoid the curse of dimensionality when testing convexity?</p>



<p><strong>Testing Isomorphism in the Bounded-Degree Graph Model</strong>, by Oded Goldreich (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/102/">ECCC</a>). This work investigates the problem of testing isomorphism of graphs, focusing on the special case when the connected components are only polylogarithmically large (the general bounded-degree case is left open). One can consider when a graph is given as input, and we have to query a graph to test if they are isomorphic. This can be shown to be equivalent (up to polylogarithmic factors) to testing (from queries) whether a sequence is a permutation of a reference sequence. In turn, this can be shown to be equivalent to the classic distribution testing question of testing (from samples) whether a distribution is equal to some reference distribution. The same sequence of equivalences <em>almost</em> works for the case where there is no reference graph/sequence/distribution, but we only have query/query/sample access to the object. The one exception is that the reduction doesn’t work to reduce from testing distributions to testing whether a sequence is a permutation, due to challenges involving sampling with and without replacement. However, the author still shows the lower bound which would be implied by such a reduction by adapting Valiant’s proof for the distribution testing problem to this case.   </p>



<p><strong>Learning Very Large Graphs with Unknown Vertex Distributions</strong>, by Gábor Elek (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10170">arXiv</a>). In this note, the author studies a variant of distribution-free property testing on graphs, in which (roughly) neighboring vertices have probabilities of bounded ratio, and a query reveals this ratio. Applications to local graph algorithms and connections to dynamical systems are also discussed.</p>



<p>EDIT: We apparently missed one paper from June — please check out the following paper, recently accepted to NeurIPS 2019.<br /><strong>The Broad Optimality of Profile Maximum Likelihood</strong>, by Yi Hao and Alon Orlitsky (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10170">arXiv</a>). Recently, Acharya, Das, Orlitsky, and Suresh (ICML 2017) showed that the Profile Maximum Likelihood (PML) estimator enables a unified framework for estimating a number of distribution properties, including support size, support coverage, entropy, and distance to uniformity, obtaining estimates which are competitive with the best possible. The approach is rather clean: simply estimate the PML of the distribution (i.e., the maximum likelihood distribution of the data, if the the labels are discarded and only the multiplicities of elements are kept), and apply the plug-in estimator (i.e., if you want to estimate entropy, compute the entropy of the resulting PML distribution). The present work shows that PML is even more broadly applicable — such an approach applies to <em>any</em> property which is additive, symmetric, and appropriately Lipschitz. They also show specific results for many other properties which have been considered in the past, including Rényi entropy, distribution estimation, and identity testing.</p></div>

<p>The program has sessions on quantum science and technology, computer science and society, computation and the life sciences, and AI and autonomous systems. The keynote speaker is Amnon Shashua who will speak on the promise of machime learning and AI in transforming industries. Other speakers are: Charles Bennett, Adi Stern, Dorit Aharonov, and Thomas Vidick (quantum); Noam Nisan, Omer Reingold, Shafi Goldwasser, and Moshe Vardi (society); Aviv Regev, Ron Shamir, Uri Alon and Leroy Hood (biology), Sarit Kraus, Eva Tardos, Naftali Tishby, and Gal Kaminka (AI), and David Harel (closing remarks).</p>
<p>As for startling connections between the theory of computation and other areas of mathematics let me refer to the <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/08/23/amazing-ryan-alweiss-shachar-lovett-kewen-wu-jiapeng-zhang-made-dramatic-progress-on-the-sunflower-conjecture/">very recent post</a> with the big news on the sunflower conjecture.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;">In the spirit of the coming Israeli elections let me promise to report more on our recent great Oberwolfach conference, on my visit to CERN, and to tell more about the sunflower progress, and about various combinatorics (and more) news I heard about. </span></p>

Avrim Blum is the CAO for TTIC. That is he is the Chief Academic Officer at the Toyota Technological Institute of Chicago. Avrim has and continues to make key contributions to many areas of theory—including machine learning, approximation algorithms, on-line algorithms, algorithmic game theory, the theory of database privacy, and non-worst-case analysis of algorithms. </p>
<p>
Today I want to discuss a suggestion of Avrim for research on self-play.<span id="more-16223"></span></p>
<p>
Self-play is the key to many recent AI results on playing games. These results include essentially solving the games Chess, Go, Shogi, forms of poker, and many others. They were solved by algorithms that start with no knowledge of the game, save the rules. The algorithm then learn the secrets of playing the game by self-play: by playing games against itself. For example, the AI chess programs did not know that “a rook is worth more than a pawn.” But they discover that by playing the game over and over. Impressive. </p>
<p>
For example, David Sweet on his hacker <a href="https://hackernoon.com/self-play-1f69ceb06a4d">site</a> says referring to self-play: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> This is mysterious to me. If it only played against itself, where did new information come from? How did it know if it was doing well? If I play a game of chess against myself, should I say I did well if I beat myself? But when I beat myself, I also lose to myself. And how could I ever know if I’d do well against someone else? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Planted Clique Problem </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I was at TTIC last month and over lunch we discussed self-play possibilities for theory problems. I suggested that the planted clique <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planted_clique">problem</a> might be a potential example. Recall the planted clique problem is the task of distinguishing two types of graphs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Random graphs on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> vertices generated with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%3D1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p=1/2}" class="latex" title="{p=1/2}" />, the probability that there is an edge between each pair of nodes; <p></p>
</li><li>
Random graphs on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> vertices generated with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%3D1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p=1/2}" class="latex" title="{p=1/2}" />, with a clique of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k}" class="latex" title="{k}" /> added, the planted clique.
</li></ul>
<p>
If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k}" class="latex" title="{k}" /> is large, it is easy to tell these apart—just count the number of edges. If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k}" class="latex" title="{k}" /> is small enough, it is open if one can tell them apart. The largest clique in a random graph typically has size near <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%3D2%5Clog_%7B2%7D+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k=2\log_{2} n}" class="latex" title="{k=2\log_{2} n}" />. This implies that there is a quasi-polynomial time average-case algorithm: just try all subsets of size around <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k}" class="latex" title="{k}" />.</p>
<p>
My intuition was that a program might be able to exploit self-play to solve planted clique problems. The point is that it is easy, by definition, to generate “yes” and “no” examples for this problem. Note, this is not known for SAT problems—generating hard instances there is not clear. This was my point. Could the AI methods somehow divine the planted clique version of “a rook is worth more than a pawn”? Could they use self-play to solve planted clique problems?</p>
<p>
I wondered to the lunch group about all this. It left the group unexcited. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Ramsey Problem </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Then Avrim asked a better question. He wondered if self-play methods could be used to solve a long standing problem concerning Ramsey numbers. Recall the Ramsey number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%28s%2Cs%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R(s,s)}" class="latex" title="{R(s,s)}" /> is defined as the smallest <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> such every red-green coloring of the edges of the complete graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{K_{n}}" class="latex" title="{K_{n}}" /> has either a red or a green subgraph of size at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{s}" class="latex" title="{s}" />.</p>
<p>
The exact value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%285%2C+5%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R(5, 5)}" class="latex" title="{R(5, 5)}" /> is unknown, although it is known to lie between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B43%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{43}" class="latex" title="{43}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B48%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{48}" class="latex" title="{48}" />. See a <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2017/03/29/r55">post</a> by Gil Kalai on his blog for some discussions. Joel Spencer quotes Paul Erdős: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Erdős asks us to imagine an alien force, vastly more powerful than us, landing on Earth and demanding the value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%285%2C+5%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R(5, 5)}" class="latex" title="{R(5, 5)}" /> or they will destroy our planet. In that case, he claims, we should marshal all our computers and all our mathematicians and attempt to find the value. But suppose, instead, that they ask for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%286%2C+6%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R(6, 6)}" class="latex" title="{R(6, 6)}" />. In that case, he believes, we should attempt to destroy the aliens.	 </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Aliens are not attacking currently, but Avrim’s idea is that perhaps we could organize a self-play attack on the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%285%2C5%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R(5,5)}" class="latex" title="{R(5,5)}" /> problem. The idea would be to try to build a “game” version of this question. The algorithm would try to create a strategy that finds a red/green coloring for the complete graph so that no <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{5}" class="latex" title="{5}" />-clique is all red or all green. </p>
<p>
We need to arrange the computation of the Ramsey number as the result of some type of game. The paradox to me is that the play of a game suggests <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BPSPACE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{PSPACE}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{PSPACE}}" />, while the Ramsey calculation is clearly of complexity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" />. So how do we make the Ramsey calculation into a game? Ken and I wonder if there is a natural game <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" /> so that playing the game well yields insight into the value of a Ramsey number.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Is there a game <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" /> with simple rules so that playing it well yields bounds on general Ramsey numbers?</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Attacks on Ramsey Numbers </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
There have been several attempts to use non-standard methods to compute Ramsey numbers. See the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
In this <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11128-013-0541-9">article</a>, quantum methods studied for the future, when hopefully quantum computers will be available. <p></p>
</li><li>
In this <a href="https://themusegarden.wordpress.com/2013/05/11/a-genetic-algorithm-approach-to-ramsey-theory/">project</a> genetic methods are used on related Ramsey numbers. <p></p>
</li><li>
In this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.01613.pdf">approach</a>, AI methods are used on related Ramsey numbers.
</li></ul>
<p>
See also this <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0662/893d7e04745a0709b3f1a092574f9dd3bf7b.pdf">survey</a> on computational methods in general.</p>
<p>
The asymmetry between the upper and lower bounds shapes approaches. The lower bound of 43 was proved by finding a two-coloring of the edges of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_%7B42%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{K_{42}}" class="latex" title="{K_{42}}" /> without a green or red <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{5}" class="latex" title="{5}" />-clique. Once a single coloring is guessed its property is easy to prove. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08768">improvement</a> of the upper bound from 49 to 48 two years ago <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2017/03/29/r55">needed</a> checking two trillion cases in order to fence-away all possible colorings. This has led to a common belief that 43 is the answer—if it were higher then a coloring of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_%7B43%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{K_{43}}" class="latex" title="{K_{43}}" /> would have been found by now.</p>
<p>
Can we use self-play to turn this belief into something more concrete? The training would begin on running self-play on the known cases <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots+38%2C39%2C40%2C41%2C42%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots 38,39,40,41,42}" class="latex" title="{\dots 38,39,40,41,42}" />. This should create a neural net that is highly skilled at finding colorings that are free of small monochrome cliques. The question is how to leverage its presumed failure once we hit size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B43%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{43}" class="latex" title="{43}" />.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Perhaps someone should take Avrim’s suggestion and try it out. A natural idea would be to see if this approach could compute the known smaller Ramsey numbers—getting their exact upper bounds. </p>

It seems I haven't written on this blog for a while.<br /><br />Today was the start of a new semester.  I'll be teaching Randomized Algorithms and Probabilistic Analysis, using the new edition of my book with Eli Upfal as a base, and throwing in other material.  (Everyone should buy the book!  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/110715488X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=michaelmitzen-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=110715488X&amp;linkId=d598fb636637ebb656410099e7042a7c">Here's a link</a>.)  <br /><br />It's a graduate level class, but generally designed for first year graduate students, and there were a lot of undergrads "shopping" it today.  (We don't do pre-registration at Harvard, and students get the first week to choose classes, known as shopping.)  So many that people were standing out the doors of the room.  But because we have a bit of a shortage of classes this semester, I'm guessing there's a good fraction of students just checking it out.  We'll see Thursday, but for now I'll predict we'll fit in the classroom, and wait to see if I'm wrong.  (If I'm wrong, that's wonderful too.)    <br /><br />It's been four years since I last taught the course, so this time I'm trying something new.  When I've previously taught the course, I tried to make the class inviting and friendly by telling the class we'd begin without assuming the class knew probability, and so the first couple of weeks would be reviewing basics (like, say, linearity of expectations and union bounds), albeit in a CS algorithms context.  This time, I let the class know I'm assuming they know (or will pick up) basic probability, and so they should read chapters 1-4 on their own, and we'll start with Chapter 5, Balls and Bins models.  Over the last decade, I've seen a huge shift in probability knowledge -- Stat 110, Harvard's probability course, has become one of Harvard's biggest classes.  Many students have already taking AI or ML or even data science courses where they've done some (further) probability.  It feels appropriate (and safe) to assume people entering in the class know probability, or can review what they need on their own, and start the class further along.<br /><br />Now finally, a request.  It's actually hard for me to teach when using this book, because I don't want to just read the book to the students.  That's boring.  On the other hand, if I thought something was important, I most likely already put it in the book.  We have to mix up the standard lecturing format a bit.  So two things we'll be doing are<br /><br />1)  doing some "puzzle problems" at the beginning of most classes, so people can try to solve problems.  (Kind of a flipped classroom approach, but not a full commitment.)<br />2)  reading papers, related to the class topics.<br /><br />So if you have any good suggestions of probability puzzle problems, or readable papers (particularly application papers) that use relatively basic probabilistic analysis in neat ways, send them over.  I've got a semester to fill.<br /><br />For curious people, here's one of today's starting problems, which I first learned about in graduate school.  (I'm pretty sure I owe thanks to Claire Kenyon for teaching it.  I'll link to the corresponding Wikipedia page on the problem maybe later.)<br /><br />After lunch, Bob suggests the following game to see who pays.  Alice and Bob will each choose a different sequence of three flips.  (So they could choose "Heads-Tails-Heads'', or "Tails-Tails-Tails'' for example.)  After they choose, a fair coin will be tossed until one of their sequences appears as a consecutive subsequence of the coin tosses.  The player whose sequence appears first wins. (Note that if they choose the above sequences, and if the flips come up Heads-Tails-Tails-Tails, the player that chose Tails-Tails-Tails would win as soon as their subsequence appears;  it's not three flips, then start over again.)  Bob politely says that Alice can choose first, and after she chooses and tells him her sequence he'll choose a different sequence.  What should Alice choose?</div>

In my last post I noted that if I am asked (since I am a CS prof)<br />
<br />
<i>Can you fix my iphone</i><br />
<br />
is<br />
<br />
<i>No, I work on the math side of CS</i><br />
<br />
Some readers emailed me (I told them to comment instead but they were worried that other readers would argue with them) that NO, this is a tired and incorrect stereotype.  Here are some samples:<br />
<br />
1) People in Mathematics are no better or worse at fixing iphones, fixing cars, programming their VCR's, etc than the public.<br />
<br />
2) For that matter, people in academica, even in practical sounding fields like Systems, are no better.<br />
<br />
3) Is your nephew Jason who used to fix forklifts for a living  better at these things then the general public? I asked him. Answer: No, though he is better at fixing forklifts.<br />
<br />
I think something else is going on here. Lets look at fixing your own car. I think this is the sort of thing that some people used to be able to do but now very few can do it. Cars have gotten more complicated. <br />
<br />
Iphones are not quite there yet but its getting that way.  <br />
<br />
Of course somethings have gotten easier--- programming a DVR is much easier than programming a VCR.   And people can easily use WORD or write programs without having to know any hardware.<br />
<br />
OKAY, after all these random thoughts, here is the question: What do you think? <br />
<br />
Are people in CS or Math or CS theory better at X than the general public where X is NOT CS, Math or CS theory, but something like fixing their cars?<br />
<br />
And<br />
<br />
What has gotten harder? What has gotten easier?<br />
<br />

We introduce a framework of layered subsets, and give a sufficient condition for when a set system supports an agreement test. Agreement testing is a certain type of property testing that generalizes PCP tests such as the plane vs. plane test. 

Previous work has shown that high dimensional expansion is useful for agreement tests. We extend these results to more general families of subsets, beyond simplicial complexes. These include

* Agreement tests for set systems whose sets are faces of high dimensional expanders. Our new tests apply to all dimensions of complexes both in case of two-sided expansion and in the case of one-sided partite expansion.  This improves and extends an earlier work of Dinur and Kaufman (FOCS 2017) and applies to matroids, and potentially many additional complexes.
* Agreement tests for set systems whose sets are neighborhoods of vertices in a high dimensional expander. This family resembles the expander neighborhood family used in the gap-amplification proof of the PCP theorem. This set system is quite natural yet does not sit in a simplicial complex, and demonstrates some versatility in our proof technique. %It could potentially be useful towards new and more efficient constructions of locally testable codes and PCPs.
* Agreement tests on families of subspaces (also known as the Grassmann poset). This extends the classical low degree agreement tests beyond the setting of low degree polynomials.

Our analysis relies on a new random walk on simplicial complexes which we call the ``complement random walk'' and which may be of independent interest. This random walk generalizes the non-lazy random walk on a graph to higher dimensions, and has significantly better expansion than previously-studied random walks on simplicial complexes.</div>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Richard Ehrenborg with a polyhedron</span></p>
<p>In the Problem session last Thursday in Oberwolfach, Steve Klee presented a beautiful problem of Richard Ehrenborg regarding the number of spanning trees in bipartite graphs.</p>
<p>Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" /> be a bipartite graph with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="m" class="latex" title="m" /> vertices on one side and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n " class="latex" title="n " /> vertices on the other side, and with vertex-degrees <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d_1%2Cd_2%2C%5Cdots+%2Cd_m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d_1,d_2,\dots ,d_m" class="latex" title="d_1,d_2,\dots ,d_m" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e_1%2Ce_2%2C%5Cdots+e_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="e_1,e_2,\dots e_n" class="latex" title="e_1,e_2,\dots e_n" />.</p>
<p><strong>Ehrenborg’s problem:</strong> Is it the case that the number of spanning trees of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" /> is at most</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%5E%7B-1%7Dn%5E%7B-1%7D+%5Cprod_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5Em+d_i+%5Cprod_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5En+e_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="m^{-1}n^{-1} \prod_{i=1}^m d_i \prod_{j=1}^n e_j" class="latex" title="m^{-1}n^{-1} \prod_{i=1}^m d_i \prod_{j=1}^n e_j" />.</p>
<p>In words, the number of spanning trees is at most the product of the vertex degrees divided by the sizes of the two sides.</p>
<p>For example for the complete bipartite graph the number of the spanning trees is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7Bm-1%7Dm%5E%7Bn-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n^{m-1}m^{n-1}" class="latex" title="n^{m-1}m^{n-1}" /> so equality hold.  More genarally,  equality holds for <strong>Ferrer’s graphs</strong>. Those are graphs where the vertices on the two sides are ordered and if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%2Cb%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(a,b)" class="latex" title="(a,b)" /> is an edge so are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%27%2Cb%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(a',b)" class="latex" title="(a',b)" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%2Cb%27%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(a,b')" class="latex" title="(a,b')" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%27%3Ca&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="a'&lt;a" class="latex" title="a'&lt;a" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%27%3Cb&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="b'&lt;b" class="latex" title="b'&lt;b" />. See<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.2918"> this paper of Richard Ehrenborg and Stephanie van Willigenburg</a>.</p>
<p>Steve Klee and Matthiew Stamps  found a new point of view for both the weighted and unweighted settings. (See<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03575"> this paper</a> by Klee and Stamps and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04973">this paper</a>.) <span id="more-17923"></span></p>
<p>There is an analogous problem for general graphs where threshold graphs replace Ferrer’s graphs. This is related to a conjecture by Grone and Merris. (There are importat related works by Kelmans.) See <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/2002-354-11/S0002-9947-02-03082-9/home.html">this paper</a> by Duval and Reiner and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0302213">this paper</a> by Martin and Reiner for related results and conjectures on spectrum of Laplacians for general simplicial complexes and shifted simplicial complexes.</p>
<p>I have learned that the Crone-Merris conjecture itself was <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/2011-363-08/S0002-9947-2011-05393-6/home.html">settled by Hua Bai in 2012</a>.

Their graph’s embedding determines the order type and has at most a third as many edges as the complete graph.</p>

<p><em>[Guest post by Sandy Irani; see also the new website <a href="http://safetoc.org">http://safetoc.org</a> for more information on this initiative. –Boaz ]</em></p>



<p>Update and follow-up on the Safe ToC initiative:  </p>



<p>Last year, a group of us served on an ad hoc committee to combat harassment and discrimination in the Theory of Computing community.  In our report, we suggested a number of measures that the various theory conferences could adopt to help in this effort.  At a minimum, we wanted conferences to adopt a code of conduct and to appoint volunteers to serve as ToC Advocates whose role will be to provide support to any individual who has experienced harassment at a conference.  Our full final report is now available here:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~irani/ToC_SH_report.pdf">https://www.ics.uci.edu/~irani/ToC_SH_report.pdf</a></p>



<p>A small subset of the original committee along with Yuval Rabani in his capacity as IEEE TCMF chair are working on implementing some of the recommendations in the recent report. We have now launched a web site for the SafeToC Initiative: <a href="http://safetoc.org">safetoc.org</a><br /></p>



<p>So far, the support from the broader community has been strong. Quite a few conferences have passed resolutions to adopt the recommended practices in our report. The new web site lists all the participating conferences as well as the names of volunteers who have signed on to be ToC Advocates. The web site also provides information for ToC Advocates, conference organizers, and members of the ToC community. <br /></p>



<p>Participating conferences all have codes of conduct and are ensuring that participants agree to abide by the code as part of their registration process. In addition, some of these conferences are adopting new mechanisms for author-declared conflicts of interests. This is especially important if an author feels that he or she may receive an unfair review due to a previous harassment-related incident. <br /></p>



<p>Of course, the work is not done, and this important effort needs to continue. What can everyone do from here?<br /></p>



<ul><li>First, we are in need of trained ToC Advocates, to spread this important service around!  An advocate would be a designated conference attendee who would be available to provide support and information to anyone who has observed or experienced harassment at the conference The work is not difficult. Right now the training consists of an hour-long webinar sponsored by the ACM. We are envisioning one or two group Skype meetings per year to share experiences and best practices. If you are interested in serving as a ToC Advocate for a conference, you can contact someone on the steering committee for that conference.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Second, even if you are not serving as an Advocate, please familiarize yourself with the various codes of conduct, and perhaps even listen to a training video!  A larger community of invested bystanders who are aware of these issues and prepared to support and/or intervene as needed is critical.  This does not have to mean formal reporting – even helping to diffuse a problematic situation or checking in on a colleague to be sure they are ok after a difficult conversation can make a big difference to someone involved in an incident.</li></ul>



<p>We will continue to update the web page as participation in this effort grows. Thank you to everyone for helping to make our community a safe and welcoming place for everyone.<br /></p>

<p>Recently, my Facebook wall was full of discussion about instituting an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/aug/16/mathematicians-need-doctor-style-hippocratic-oath-says-academic-hannah-fry?fbclid=IwAR1yvNyv8P4UJWhiAH_kshgXjjs_MZ2aVsfmLxrEv4d2sKAIzf2q3TtS4PQ">oath for STEM workers</a>, analogous to the Hippocratic oath for doctors.  Perhaps some of the motivation for this comes from a worldview I can’t get behind—one that holds STEM nerds almost uniquely responsible for the world’s evils.  Nevertheless, on reflection, I find myself in broad support of the idea.</p>



<p>But I prefer writing the oath myself.  Here’s my attempt:</p>



<p>1. I will never allow anyone else to make me a cog.  I will never do what is stupid or horrible because “that’s what the regulations say” or “that’s what my supervisor said,” and then sleep soundly at night.  I’ll never do my part for a project unless I’m satisfied that the project’s broader goals are, at worst, morally neutral.  There’s no one on earth who gets to say: “I just solve technical problems.  Moral implications are outside my scope.”  </p>



<p>2. If I build or supply tools that are used to do evil or cause suffering, I’ll be horrified as soon as I learn about it.  Yes, I might judge that the good of the tools outweighs the bad, that the bad can’t be prevented, etc.  But I’ll be hyper-alert to the possibility of self-serving bias in such reflections, and will choose a different course of action whenever the reflections are no longer persuasive to my highest self.</p>



<p>3. I will pursue the truth, and hold the sharing of truth and exposing of falsehoods among my highest moral values.</p>



<p>4. I will make a stink, resign, leak to the press, sabotage, rather than go along quietly with decisions inimical to my values.</p>



<p>5. I will put everything on the line for my students, advisees, employees—my time, funds, reputation, and credibility.  And not only because it can somewhat make up for failings in the other areas.</p>



<p>6. Black, white, male, female, trans, gay, straight, Israeli, Palestinian, young, old.  Whatever ideologies I might subscribe to about which groups are advantaged and which disadvantaged in which aspects of life—when it comes time to interact with a person, I will throw ideology into the ocean and treat them solely as an individual, not as a representative of a group.</p>



<p>7. I will not be Jeffrey Epstein—and not just in the narrow sense of not collecting underage girls on a private sex island.  I’ll see myself always as accountable to the moral judgment of history.  Whenever I’m publicly accused of wrongdoing, I’ll consider only two options: (a) if guilty, then confess, offer restitution, beg for forgiveness, or (b) if innocent, then mount a full public defense.  Finding some escape that avoids the need for either of these—from legal maneuvering to suicide—will never be on the table for me.</p>



<p>8. I’m under no obligation to blog or tweet every detail of my private life.  Yet even in my most private moments, I’ll act in such a way that, <em>if</em> my actions were made public, I’d have a defense of which I was unashamed.</p>



<p>9. To whatever extent I was gifted at birth with a greater-than-average ability to prove theorems or write code or whatever, I’ll treat it as just that—a gift, which I didn’t earn or deserve.  It doesn’t make me inherently worthier than anyone else, but it <em>does</em> give me a moral obligation to use the gift for good.  And whenever I’m tempted to be jealous of various non-nerds—of their ease in social or romantic situations, wealth, looks, power, athletic ability, or anything else about them—I’ll remember the gift, and that all in all, I made out better than I had a right to expect.</p>



<p>10. I’ll be conscious always of living in a universe where catastrophes—genocides, destructions of civilizations, extinctions of magnificent species—have happened and will happen again.  The burning of the Amazon, the deaths of children, the bleaching of coral reefs, will weigh on me daily, to the maximum extent consistent with being able to get out of bed in the morning, live, and work.  While it’s not obvious that <em>any</em> of these problems are open to a STEM-nerd solution, of the sort I could plausibly think of or implement—nevertheless, I’ll keep asking myself whether any of them are.  And if I ever <em>do</em> find myself before one of the levers of history, I’ll pull with all my strength to try to prevent these catastrophes.</p></div>

<div class="content">
<p>I’ve <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2012/12/16/grid-minors-in.html">written here about grid minors</a> before, <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2013/03/05/more-on-grid.html">more than once</a>. These are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_graph">grid graphs</a> that you can get from a given graph  as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_minor">minor</a> (that is, by removing edges or vertices from  and contracting others of its edges). So, in the other direction, a “grid major” of  must be a grid graph that has  as a minor. These are the subject of my new preprint, “Homotopy height, grid-major height and graph-drawing height” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05706">arXiv:1908.05706</a>, with Therese Biedl, Erin Chambers, Arnaud De Mesmay, and Tim Ophelders, to appear at Graph Drawing).</p>

<p>You can define the terms in the paper’s title for any planar graph, but our results are cleanest for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_planar_graph">maximal planar graphs</a>. If we define the height of a grid to be the smaller of its two dimensions, then the grid-major height of a graph  is just the smallest height of a grid that has  as a minor. The detailed definition of homotopy height is trickier to explain, but the rough idea is that (after choosing one face of your graph to be the outer one) you should sweep a path from one edge of the outer face, across the graph, to another edge of the outer face, trying as you do to keep the path as short as possible. Paths can move across triangular faces (changing the number of vertices by ) or path vertices can “slide” along edges  (leaving the total number unchanged. The smallest length  such that you can do this sweep and always maintain length at most  turns out to equal the grid-major height, and both are lower bounds on the height of a conventional drawing of the graph (with its vertices at grid points and its edges as straight line segments).</p>

<p>For instance, the following drawing shows a height- grid drawing of a maximal planar graph, a sequence of  paths of length at most  sweeping from the left to the right edge of the graph, and the subsets of vertices to contract in a  grid to produce the graph as a minor. Each column of the grid has the same vertices as the corresponding path in the walk. For this graph, the drawing height, homotopy height, and grid-major height are all equal, but it is possible for the drawing height to be much larger than the other two quantities.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/grid-majors.svg" alt="Grid drawing of a maximal planar graph, homotopy sequence for the graph, and grid major representation of the graph" /></p>

<p>Both homotopy height and grid-major height come in simple and non-simple variations. They are equal for both variations, and both variations give a valid lower bound on graph drawing height. In simple homotopy height the swept path is required to stay simple (as it is in the example here) while more generally we allow walks that can repeat vertices. (In particular they can have “spikes”, parts of paths that double back along a single edge.) Correspondingly, non-simple grid-major height does not restrict how  is formed as a minor of a grid while the simple variant requires the parts of the grid corresponding to a single vertex of  to be contiguous within each column of the grid (as they are in the example here).</p>

<p>Because grid-major height behaves nicely under graph minor operations, it is automatically fixed-parameter tractable, but in a non-uniform way. What this means is that for each  there are finitely many graphs that, when they are a minor of , prevent  from having grid-major height . We can find the grid-major height of  by looking for these “obstacles” and returning the smallest  for which no obstacles are found. And, whenever  is bounded, the time of the resulting algorithm is a polynomial whose exponent is independent of the size of . So an algorithm exists for any fixed , but we don’t know how to actually write it down as a program because we don’t know what the obstacles are or even whether the number of obstacles is computable.</p>

<p>Simple grid-major height is nicer from the algorithmic point of view, but still not entirely satisfactory. Our paper describes the existence of a simple grid major using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_of_graphs">logic of graphs</a>. When  is bounded this gives us a linear-time algorithm via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courcelle%27s_theorem">Courcelle’s theorem</a>. The algorithm could in principle be written out explicitly as a program,
with  given as an input to the program rather than hardcoded into it. There is no problem with unknown lists of obstacles. But the logical description is huge and the dependence of Courcelle’s theorem on the size of the logical description is very high, so although the time is linear in the size of the graph it gets multiplied by a very quickly growing function <span style="white-space: nowrap;">of .</span></p>

<p>
Danny Cohen was a pioneer who advanced many areas of computer science. He made contributions to computer graphics, networking, and flight simulation, and much more.</p>
<p>
Today I want to remember him and his work.</p>
<p><span id="more-16208"></span></p>
<p>
Danny is hard to label. Leonard Kleinrock, said that Cohen “had the uncanny ability to employ his deep mathematical intellect and insight to real world challenges, with enormous impact.” Indeed. This is quoted in last week’s New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/obituaries/danny-cohen-who-helped-set-the-stage-for-a-digital-era-dies-at-81.html">obit</a>. The Los Angeles Times <a href="https://www.latimes.com/obituaries/story/2019-08-20/danny-cohen-computer-scientist-dead">obit</a> noted his 1981 <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1667115">paper</a> addressed to warring “Big Endian” and “Little Endian” camps.</p>
<p>
Obituaries for Danny do not, in my opinion, explain why Danny was so remarkable. For example, he impacted theory even though he never worked in it. Let me explain in a moment. But first <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /></p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Danny—isms </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I worked with Danny. I was on a government committee that he chaired, years ago. He was an excellent leader, a tough chair, and ran a tight ship. He had been a fighter pilot, perhaps that is why he was such a great leader. On that committee—I will not identify it—he once fired a new committee member as he left the first meeting. Really as he walked out the door, while the rest of us were still meeting. He immediately said that he would not be staying on the committee. Tough. Yes. But Danny knew how to run a meeting.</p>
<p>
Danny had a clever wit. One of his favorite jokes was based on a form he had printed out:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The_____________________________technology is a promising technology and always will be.
</p></blockquote>
<p>He then would fill in the blank with whatever you thought was a great technology and hand it to you. Today perhaps we might fill in “quantum computing”—or is that wrong to say?</p>
<p>
Danny loved irony. His son revealed that Danny had joined the Flat Earth <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_flat_Earth_societies">Society</a>. Danny was initially rejected—no scientists allowed. After he got in—this time he did not list his profession—he framed the certificate of membership, the rejection letter and the Flat Earth Society’s map of the world, complete with an emblazoned “Australia Not Down Under..”</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> MOSIS </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
A key contribution that seems to be missed in obits I’ve seen is that he helped create the VLSI revolution. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSIS">MOSIS</a> is the <i>Metal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation Service</i>. Danny created it, <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/9412602.pdf">styling</a> it after the earlier work of the pioneer Lynn Conway. Ten points if you know what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Scale_Integration">VLSI</a> stands for.</p>
<p>
MOSIS allowed researchers to actually fabricate their designs: to convert digital plans into chips that worked. You designed the chips yourself, encoded in a strange digital file format. Then you sent the files to MOSIS. They then placed you design along with other designs onto one wafer. A wafer held many designs. The wafer files were finally sent to a commercial foundry. There they were converted from digital into silicon. When MOSIS got them back they broke the wafers up and sent you the chips that you designed. </p>
<p>
This was magical. The beauty was we could make working chips without having to have our own foundry. At that time frame many companies in the computer business would boast that they had they own <i>captive foundry</i>. Few could afford the huge cost of having their own fabrication foundry. Danny liked to say: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A captive foundry was one that captured you. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>His point was that if you had your own foundry, you probably would be forced to use it, even if it was not the right type for your needs. Captive indeed.</p>
<p>
Since 1981, when it started, countless projects have been fabricated. MOSIS was a brilliant idea that made it possible for many to build working VLSI chips. We did that more that once while I was at Princeton University. While at Princeton my students and I sent several designs to MOSIS. For example, Dan Lopresti sent in a design that we discussed before <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/07/08/nsf-workshop-on-design-automation-and-theory/">here</a>.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/08/29/danny-cohen-passed-away/lop/" rel="attachment wp-att-16217"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/lop.png?w=140&amp;h=300" alt="" width="140" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-16217" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>
The ability to make chips was a terrific motivator. I believe that the excitement of being able to make your own devices helped move the field forward. Without MOSIS, without Danny, the field would have advanced much slower. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Perhaps the lesson of MOSIS is not lost on us. Today there are “MOSIS” like systems that allow even theorists to execute physically real quantum computations. This is indirectly thanks to Danny. We owe him much.</p>

<p><a href="http://sites.uci.edu/juanbesa/">Juan Besa’s</a> successful dissertation defense was last Thursday, but I’ve been holding off posting about it here because one of his committee members took ill and couldn’t sign off on it until today.</p>

<p>Juan started his graduate work in embedded systems, but for the last several years he has been one of the theory students at UCI, advised by Mike Goodrich. <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/a-besa.html">My joint papers with him</a> have included <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2016/09/16/directing-traffic.html">algorithms for scheduling traffic signals to allow groups of vehicles to move through them quickly</a> and <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2018/05/09/sorting-when-sorted.html">maintaining an approximately sorted list</a> of items whose sorted order is changing dynamically in a context where comparisons are expensive.</p>

<p>He also has papers on which I was not involved, on chess knights’ tours with few crossings or bends (mentioned briefly with links <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/01/31/linkage.html">here</a>), <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01630">embedding planar digraphs so each vertex has few alternations between incoming and outgoing edges</a> (to appear at ESA), and another one on low-width tree drawing that has yet to appear publicly as a paper but forms part of his dissertation.</p>

<p>Juan has dual Chilean and Spanish citizenship, and (having the usual double-barreled Spanish surname “Besa Vial”) had to deal with the difficulties of getting that name format understood in non-Spanish-speaking countries; he ended up choosing to truncate it to “Besa” in his recent publications. He is heading to England to work at a machine learning company there. With Brexit coming up quickly, I worry about how that will work out, but I hope it does work well for him.</p>

<p>Congratulations, Juan!</p>
