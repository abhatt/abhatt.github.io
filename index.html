Michael Kearns and Aaron Roth are the authors of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ethical-Algorithm-Science-Socially-Design/dp/0190948205">book</a> <em>Ethical Algorithms and the The Science of Socially Aware Algorithm Design</em>. It has earned strong reviews including this <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-019-0768-1.epdf?shared_access_token=PLLHPNTn5pByQUPaJ-n_KdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OmI9hygrW1-UKQon3ZVGlMNsZowBl_5psAIvdU-Dic4gtf_j0e7S_897lCTN3vdbqv3cbSQwUtbHG78r5ycJNB2VKFndoPOT_8w0OYjS-pjQ%3D%3D">one</a> in <i>Nature</i>—impressive.</p>
<p>
Michael is a long-time friend who is a leader in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and much <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/">more</a>. He also overlapped with Ken at Oxford while visiting Les Valiant there in the mid-1980s. He is at the University of Pennsylvania in computer science along with his co-author Roth. Cynthia Dwork and Roth wrote an earlier <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/privacybook.html">book</a> on the related issue of Differential Privacy.</p>
<p>
Today we will talk about making algorithms ethical.</p>
<p>
Tuesday is the 2020 US national election for President, for Congress, and for state and local offices. Every four years we have a national election, and we cannot imagine a better motivation for making sure that algorithms are ethical. </p>
<p>
The word “algorithm” appears 157 times in their book. Two words used hand-in-hand with it are “data” (132 times) and “model” (103 times), both spread through all of the book’s 232 pages. Models of electorates, trained on data from past elections, inform the algorithms used by news agencies to make election-night projections. These carry more responsibilities than election-eve forecasts. There have been infamous mistakes, most notably the premature calls of Florida both ways in the 2000 election. </p>
<p>
We believe that Tuesday’s election in our novel pandemic situation requires attention to ethics from first principles. We will discuss why this is important. What it means to be ethical here? And how one can make an algorithm ethical? </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Issue </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Algorithms have been around forever. Euclid devised his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm">gcd</a> algorithm in 300 BCE. In the first half of the last century, the central issue was how to define that an algorithm is <b>effective</b>. This led to showing that some problems are <em>uncomputable</em>, so that algorithms for them are impossible.</p>

In the second half, the emphasis shifted to whether algorithms are <b>efficient</b>. This led to classifying problems as <em>feasible</em> or (contingently) <em>hard</em>. Although many algorithms for feasible problems have been improved in ways that redouble the effect of faster and cheaper hardware, the study of complexity classes such as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" /> has given reasons why algorithms for hard problems may never be improvable.</p>
<p>
The new territory, that of Kearns and Roth, is whether algorithms are <b>ethical</b>. Current ones that they and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_of_Math_Destruction">others</a> have critqued as unethical accompany models for the likes of mortgages, small-business loans, parole decisions, and college admissions. The training data for these models often bakes in past biases. Besides problems of racial and gender bias and concerns of societal values, the raw fact is that past biases cause the models to miss the mark for today’s applications. For algorithms with such direct application to society, ethical design is critical. </p>
<p>
But this requirement is further reaching that one might initially imagine, so that as with computability and complexity, the factors can be ingrained in the <em>problems</em>. </p>
<p>
Consider a simple problem: We given a collection of pairs of numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{(x,y)}" class="latex" title="{(x,y)}" />. We are to predict whether this number pair has the property </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x+%2B+y+%5Cge+0.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  x + y \ge 0. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  x + y \ge 0. " /></p>
<p>This is pretty easy if we can use both <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />. But imagine a world where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> is allowed to be viewed but <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> is secret. Perhaps the law requires that we cannot use <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />—it is illegal. Now we might do as poorly as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B50%5C%25%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{50\%}" class="latex" title="{50\%}" />. Suppose that the data consists of </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%281%2C-1%29%2C+%281%2C1%29%2C+%282%2C-2%29%2C+%282%2C2%29+%5Cdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  (1,-1), (1,1), (2,-2), (2,2) \dots " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  (1,-1), (1,1), (2,-2), (2,2) \dots " /></p>
<p>Then seeing only <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> gives no advantage, while giving both is perfect. Thus what in these simplified terms counts as an ethical algorithm is a poor predictor, whereas an unethical one is perfect. </p>
<p>
The blurb for the Kearns-Roth book says that they “…explain how we can better embed human principles into machine code—without halting the advance of data-driven scientific exploration.” While we agree their approach is vital, we suspect that as with complexity there will be indelibly ethically hard tasks. We wonder whether election modeling has already become one of them. </p>
<p>
Ken and I have two separate takes on this. We will do the first and then the other in a second post.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Red/Blue Leakage, Bias, and Ethics </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
One question on everyone’s minds is whether we will see a repeat of the forecasting misses from 2016. Let us remind that our own Election Day 2016 <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/11/08/unskewing-the-election/">post</a> started by defending Nate Silver of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight</a> for giving Donald Trump as much as a 30% chance to defeat Hillary Clinton. He had been attacked by representatives of many news and opinion agencies whose models had Clinton well over 90%. </p>
<p>
We wonder whether these models were affected by the kind of biases highlighted in the book by Kearns and Roth. We must say right away that we are neither alleging conscious biases nor questioning the desire for prediction accuracy. One issue in ethical modeling (for parole, loans, admissions) is the divergence between algorithm outcomes that are most <em>predictive</em> versus those that are best for society. Here we agree that accurate prediction—and accurate projections as results come in after the polls close—is paramount. However, the algorithms used for the latter projections (which were not at fault in 2016 but have been wrong previously) may be even more subject to what we as computer scientists with crypto background see as a “leakage” issue.</p>
<p>
Here is the point. Ideally, models using polling data and algorithms reading the Election Night returns should read the numbers as if they did not have ‘R’ and ‘D’ attached to them. Their own workings should be invariant under transformations that interchange Joe Biden and Donald Trump, or whoever are opposed in a local race. However, a crucial element in the projection models in particular is knowledge of voting geography. They must use data on the general voting preferences of regions where much of the vote is still extant. Thus they cannot avoid intimate knowledge of who is ‘R’ and who is ‘D.’ There is no double-blind or zero-knowledge approach to the subjects being projected.</p>
<p>
There is also the question of error bars. A main point of our 2016 post (and of Silver’s analysis) was the high uncertainty factor that could be read from how the Clinton-Trump race unfolded. Underestimating uncertainty causes overconfidence in models. This can result from “groupthink” of the kind we perceive in newsrooms of many of the same outlets that are doing the projections. The algorithms ought to be isolated from opinions of those in the organization, but again there is reason from the last election to wonder about leakage.</p>
<p>
Unlike cases addressed by Kearns and Roth, we do not see a solution to suggest. As in our simple <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x+y}" class="latex" title="{x+y}" /> example, prior knowledge of the data in full may be needed for prediction. This may just be an “Ethics-Hard” problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p>
The word “election” does <i>not</i> appear in Kearns and Roth’s book.  What further application of their standpoint to elections would you make?</p>
<p>Ken sees a larger question of ethical modeling decisions given the unprecedented circumstances of the current election.  This comes not from spatial geography distorted by the pandemic but rather from the dimension of time injected by massive early voting and late counting of many mailed ballots.  He will address this next.</p></font></font></div>

block-structured quadrangular meshes, and the field singularities have a key
impact on the structure of the resulting meshes. In this paper, we extend
Ginzburg-Landau cross field generation methods with a new formulation that
allows a user to impose inner singularities. The cross field is computed via
the optimization of a linear objective function with localized quadratic
constraints. This method consists in fixing singularities in small holes
drilled in the computational domain with specific degree conditions on their
boundaries, which leads to non-singular cross fields on the drilled domain. We
also propose a way to calculate the Ginzburg-Landau energy of these cross
fields on the perforated domain by solving a Neumann linear problem. This
energy converges to the energy of the Ginzburg-Landau functional as epsilon and
the radius of the holes tend to zero. To obtain insights concerning the sum of
the inner singularity degrees, we give: (i) an extension of the Ginzburg-Landau
energy to the piecewise smooth domain allowing to identify the positions and
degrees of the boundary singularities, and (ii) an interpretation of the
Poincar\'e-Hopf theorem focusing on internal singularities.

<p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Bhattacharya:Sayan.html">Sayan Bhattacharya</a>, Fabrizio Grandoni, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/w/Wajc:David.html">David Wajc</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.16376">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>Nearly thirty years ago, Bar-Noy, Motwani and Naor [IPL'92] conjectured that
an online $(1+o(1))\Delta$-edge-coloring algorithm exists for $n$-node graphs
of maximum degree $\Delta=\omega(\log n)$. This conjecture remains open in
general, though it was recently proven for bipartite graphs under
\emph{one-sided vertex arrivals} by Cohen et al.~[FOCS'19]. In a similar vein,
we study edge coloring under widely-studied relaxations of the online model.
</p>
<p>Our main result is in the \emph{random-order} online model. For this model,
known results fall short of the Bar-Noy et al.~conjecture, either in the degree
bound [Aggarwal et al.~FOCS'03], or number of colors used [Bahmani et
al.~SODA'10]. We achieve the best of both worlds, thus resolving the Bar-Noy et
al.~conjecture in the affirmative for this model.
</p>
<p>Our second result is in the adversarial online (and dynamic) model with
\emph{recourse}. A recent algorithm of Duan et al.~[SODA'19] yields a
$(1+\epsilon)\Delta$-edge-coloring with poly$(\log n/\epsilon)$ recourse. We
achieve the same with poly$(1/\epsilon)$ recourse, thus removing all dependence
on $n$.
</p>
<p>Underlying our results is one common offline algorithm, which we show how to
implement in these two online models. Our algorithm, based on the R\"odl Nibble
Method, is an adaptation of the distributed algorithm of Dubhashi et
al.~[TCS'98]. The Nibble Method has proven successful for distributed edge
coloring. We display its usefulness in the context of online algorithms.

Williamson</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.16316">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>Over the last two decades, a significant line of work in theoretical
algorithms has been progress in solving linear systems of the form
$\mathbf{L}\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{b}$, where $\mathbf{L}$ is the Laplacian matrix
of a weighted graph with weights $w(i,j)&gt;0$ on the edges. The solution
$\mathbf{p}$ of the linear system can be interpreted as the potentials of an
electrical flow. Kelner, Orrechia, Sidford, and Zhu \cite{KOSZ13} give a
combinatorial, near-linear time algorithm that maintains the Kirchoff Current
Law, and gradually enforces the Kirchoff Potential Law. Here we consider a dual
version of the algorithm that maintains the Kirchoff Potential Law, and
gradually enforces the Kirchoff Current Law. We prove that this dual algorithm
also runs in a near-linear number of iterations. Each iteration requires
updating all potentials on one side of a fundamental cut of a spanning tree by
a fixed amount. If this update step can be performed in polylogarithmic time,
we can also obtain a near-linear time algorithm to solve $\mathbf{L}\mathbf{p}
= \mathbf{b}$. However, if we abstract this update step as a natural data
structure problem, we show that we can use the data structure to solve a
problem that has been conjectured to be difficult for dynamic algorithms, the
online vector-matrix-vector problem \cite{HKNS15}. The conjecture implies that
the data structure does not have an $O(n^{1-\epsilon})$ time algorithm for any
$\epsilon &gt; 0$. Thus our dual algorithm cannot be near-linear time algorithm
for solving $\mathbf{L}\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{b}$ unless we are able to take
advantage of the structure of the particular update steps that our algorithm
uses.

3XOR game, we show existence of a perfect commuting operator strategy for the
game can be decided in polynomial time. Previously this problem was not known
to be decidable. Our proof leads to a construction, showing a 3XOR game has a
perfect commuting operator strategy iff it has a perfect tensor product
strategy using a 3 qubit (8 dimensional) GHZ state. This shows that for perfect
3XOR games the advantage of a quantum strategy over a classical strategy
(defined by the quantum-classical bias ratio) is bounded. This is in contrast
to the general 3XOR case where the optimal quantum strategies can require high
dimensional states and there is no bound on the quantum advantage.
</p>
<p>To prove these results, we first show equivalence between deciding the value
of an XOR game and solving an instance of the subgroup membership problem on a
class of right angled Coxeter groups. We then show, in a proof that consumes
most of this paper, that the instances of this problem corresponding to 3XOR
games can be solved in polynomial time.

presented a distributed algorithm for maintaining an MIS with $O(1)$
(amortized) round complexity and $O(m^{3/4})$ message complexity, where $m$
denotes the dynamic number of edges in the graph. The algorithm of Assadi et

distributed algorithm for this problem with a message complexity of
$o(m^{3/4})$ incurs a round complexity of $\Omega(m^{1/3})$. We propose a
deterministic distributed algorithm that achieves an amortized message
complexity of $\tilde{O}(m^{2/3})$ and an amortized round complexity of
$\tilde{O}(1)$ under fully dynamic edge updates in the CONGEST model, where
$\tilde{O}(\cdot)$ suppresses polylogarithmic factors.

consists in recolouring at each step a random vertex of a graph with a new
colour chosen uniformly at random among the colours not already present in its
neighbourhood. It is known that when the total number of colours available is
at least $\Delta +2$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph, this
process converges to a uniform distribution on the set of all the colourings.
Moreover, a well known conjecture is that the time it takes for the convergence
to happen, called the mixing time, is polynomial in the size of the graph. Many
weaker variants of this conjecture have been studied in the literature by
allowing either more colours, or restricting the graphs to particular classes,
or both. This paper follows this line of research by studying the mixing time
of the Glauber dynamics on chordal graphs, as well as graphs of bounded
treewidth. We show that the mixing time is polynomial in the size of the graph
in the two following cases:
</p>
<p>- on graphs with bounded treewidth, and at least $\Delta +2$ colours,
</p>
<p>- on chordal graphs if the number of colours is at least $(1+\varepsilon)
(\Delta +1)$, for any fixed constant $\varepsilon$.

by analyzing the fastest way to process graphs: pushing the updates to a shared
state or pulling the updates to a private state.We investigate the
applicability of this push-pull dichotomy to various algorithms and its impact
on complexity, performance, and the amount of used locks, atomics, and
reads/writes. We consider 11 graph algorithms, 3 programming models, 2 graph
abstractions, and various families of graphs. The conducted analysis
illustrates surprising differences between push and pull variants of different
algorithms in performance, speed of convergence, and code complexity; the
insights are backed up by performance data from hardware counters.We use these
findings to illustrate which variant is faster for each algorithm and to
develop generic strategies that enable even higher speedups. Our insights can
be used to accelerate graph processing engines or libraries on both
massively-parallel shared-memory machines as well as distributed-memory

high-dimensional data is computationally challenging. For this problem, both
memory and computational requirements scale quadratically with the dimension.
Fortunately, high-dimensional covariance matrices observed in text,
click-through, and meta-genomics datasets are often sparse. In this paper, we
consider the problem of efficiently estimating a sparse covariance matrix,
which can scale to matrices with trillions of entries. The scale of the
datasets requires the algorithm to be online, as any second pass over the data
is prohibitive. In this paper, we propose Active Sampling Count Sketch (ASCS),
an online and one-pass sketching algorithm, that recovers the large entries of
the covariance matrix accurately. Count Sketch (CS), and other sub-linear
compressed sensing algorithms, offer a natural solution to the problem in
theory. However, vanilla CS does not work well in practice due to a low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). At the heart of our approach is a novel active
sampling strategy that increases the SNR of classical count sketches. We
demonstrate the practicality of our algorithm with synthetic data and
real-world high dimensional datasets. ASCS significantly improves over vanilla
CS, demonstrating the merit of our active sampling strategy.

analysis may contain hundreds of billions of edges. Yet, they are not
necessarily stored efficiently, and standard graph representations such as
adjacency lists waste a significant number of bits while graph compression
schemes such as WebGraph often require time-consuming decompression. To address
this, we propose Log(Graph): a graph representation that combines high
compression ratios with very low-overhead decompression to enable cheaper and
faster graph processing. The key idea is to encode a graph so that the parts of
the representation approach or match the respective storage lower bounds. We
call our approach "graph logarithmization" because these bounds are usually
logarithmic. Our high-performance Log(Graph) implementation based on modern
bitwise operations and state-of-the-art succinct data structures achieves high
compression ratios as well as performance. For example, compared to the tuned
Graph Algorithm Processing Benchmark Suite (GAPBS), it reduces graph sizes by
20-35% while matching GAPBS' performance or even delivering speedups due to
reducing amounts of transferred data. It approaches the compression ratio of
the established WebGraph compression library while enabling speedups of up to
more than 2x. Log(Graph) can improve the design of various graph processing
engines or libraries on single NUMA nodes as well as distributed-memory
systems.

connected $m$-edge graphs, for some positive $b &lt; 2$. Roditty and Vassilevska
Williams (STOC'13) proved that under plausible complexity assumptions, there is
no truly subquadratic algorithm for computing the diameter of general graphs.
In this work, we present positive and negative results on the existence of such
algorithms for computing the diameter on some special graph classes.
Specifically, three vertices in a graph form an asteroidal triple (AT) if
between any two of them there exists a path that avoids the closed
neighbourhood of the third one. We call a graph AT-free if it does not contain
an AT. We first prove that for all $m$-edge AT-free graphs, one can compute all
the eccentricities in truly subquadratic ${\cal O}(m^{3/2})$ time. Then, we
extend our study to several subclasses of chordal graphs -- all of them
generalizing interval graphs in various ways --, as an attempt to understand
which of the properties of AT-free graphs, or natural generalizations of the
latter, can help in the design of fast algorithms for the diameter problem on
broader graph classes. For instance, for all chordal graphs with a dominating
shortest path, there is a linear-time algorithm for computing a diametral pair
if the diameter is at least four. However, already for split graphs with a
dominating edge, under plausible complexity assumptions, there is no truly
subquadratic algorithm for deciding whether the diameter is either $2$ or $3$.

$\kappa \in \mathbb{R}$ is fixed. Various characteristics of $S$ such as its
surface measure and the largest $M$ for which it is non-empty, were computed
heuristically in statistical physics in the asymptotic regime $N \to \infty$,
$M/N \to \alpha$. The case $\kappa&lt;0$ is of special interest as $S$ is
conjectured to exhibit a hierarchical tree-like geometry known as "full
replica-symmetry breaking" (FRSB) close to the satisfiability threshold
$\alpha_{\text{SAT}}(\kappa)$, and whose characteristics are captured by a
Parisi variational principle akin to the one appearing in the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. In this paper we design an efficient algorithm
which, given oracle access to the solution of the Parisi variational principle,
exploits this conjectured FRSB structure for $\kappa&lt;0$ and outputs a vector
$\hat{\sigma}$ satisfying $\langle g_a , \hat{\sigma}\rangle \ge \kappa

$\sqrt{\bar{q} N}$, where $\bar{q} \in (0,1)$ is the right-end of the support
of the associated Parisi measure. We expect $\hat{\sigma}$ to be approximately
the barycenter of a pure state of the spherical perceptron. Moreover we expect
that $\bar{q} \to 1$ as $\alpha \to \alpha_{\text{SAT}}(\kappa)$, so that
$\big\langle g_a,\hat{\sigma}/|\hat{\sigma}|\big\rangle \geq
(\kappa-o(1))\sqrt{N}$ near criticality.

in a system of $k$ trees, or the Cartesian product of $k$ trees, we can compute
all eccentricities in ${\cal O}(2^{{\cal O}(k\log{k})}(N+n)^{1+o(1)})$ time,
where $N$ is the cumulative total order over all these $k$ trees. This is near
optimal under the Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis, even in the very special
case of an $n$-vertex graph embedded in a system of $\omega(\log{n})$ spanning
trees. However, given such an embedding in the strong product of $k$ trees,
there is a much faster ${\cal O}(N + kn)$-time algorithm for this problem. All
our positive results can be turned into approximation algorithms for the graphs
and finite spaces with a quasi isometric embedding in trees, if such embedding
is given as input, where the approximation factor (resp., the approximation
constant) depends on the distortion of the embedding (resp., of its stretch).
The existence of embeddings in the Cartesian product of finitely many trees has
been thoroughly investigated for cube-free median graphs. We give the
first-known quasi linear-time algorithm for computing the diameter within this
graph class. It does not require an embedding in a product of trees to be given
as part of the input. On our way, being given an $n$-node tree $T$, we propose
a data structure with ${\cal O}(n\log{n})$ pre-processing time in order to
compute in ${\cal O}(k\log^2{n})$ time the eccentricity of any subset of $k$
nodes. We combine the latter technical contribution, of independent interest,
with a recent distance-labeling scheme that was designed for cube-free median
graphs.

networks and other large complex networks, often answering to a query within a
few microseconds for graphs with millions of edges. In this work, we study
their algorithmic applications beyond distance queries. We focus on
eccentricity queries and distance-sum queries, for several versions of these
problems on directed weighted graphs, that is in part motivated by their
importance in facility location problems. On the negative side, we show
conditional lower bounds for these above problems on unweighted undirected
sparse graphs, via standard constructions from "Fine-grained" complexity.
However, things take a different turn when the hub labels have a sublogarithmic
size. Indeed, given a hub labeling of maximum label size $\leq k$, after
pre-processing the labels in total $2^{{O}(k)} \cdot |V|^{1+o(1)}$ time, we can
compute both the eccentricity and the distance-sum of any vertex in $2^{{O}(k)}
\cdot |V|^{o(1)}$ time. It can also be applied to the fast global computation
of some topological indices. Finally, as a by-product of our approach, on any
fixed class of unweighted graphs with bounded expansion, we can decide whether
the diameter of an $n$-vertex graph in the class is at most $k$ in $f(k) \cdot
n^{1+o(1)}$ time, for some "explicit" function $f$.

learning potentially offer an exponential speedup over all known classical
algorithms. However, there also exist obstacles to obtaining this potential
speedup in useful problem instances. The essential obstacle for quantum
differential equation solving is that outputting useful information may require
difficult post-processing, and the essential obstacle for quantum machine
learning is that inputting the training set is a difficult task just by itself.
In this paper, we demonstrate, when combined, these difficulties solve one
another. We show how the output of quantum differential equation solving can
serve as the input for quantum machine learning, allowing dynamical analysis in
terms of principal components, power spectra, and wavelet decompositions. To
illustrate this, we consider continuous time Markov processes on
epidemiological and social networks. These quantum algorithms provide an
exponential advantage over existing classical Monte Carlo methods.

paper of Fox, Panigrahi, and Zhang which gives an extension of the Karger-Stein
algorithm to minimum cuts and minimum $k$-cuts in hypergraphs. When specialized
to the case of graphs, the algorithm is somewhat different than the original
Karger-Stein algorithm. We show that the analysis becomes particularly clean in
this case: we can prove that the probability that a fixed minimum cut in an $n$
node graph is returned by the algorithm is bounded below by $1/(2H_n-2)$, where
$H_n$ is the $n$th harmonic number. We also consider other similar variants of
the algorithm, and show that no such algorithm can achieve an asymptotically
better probability of finding a fixed minimum cut.

social networks and fuzzy interpretations in fuzzy description logics have been
widely studied. For such structures, bisimulation is a natural notion for
characterizing indiscernibility between states or individuals. There are two
kinds of bisimulations for fuzzy structures: crisp bisimulations and fuzzy
bisimulations. While the latter fits to the fuzzy paradigm, the former has also
attracted attention due to the application of crisp equivalence relations, for
example, in minimizing structures. Bisimulations can be formulated for fuzzy
labeled graphs and then adapted to other fuzzy structures. In this article, we
present an efficient algorithm for computing the partition corresponding to the
largest crisp bisimulation of a given finite fuzzy labeled graph. Its
complexity is of order $O((m\log{l} + n)\log{n})$, where $n$, $m$ and $l$ are
the number of vertices, the number of nonzero edges and the number of different
fuzzy degrees of edges of the input graph, respectively. We also study a
similar problem for the setting with counting successors, which corresponds to
the case with qualified number restrictions in description logics and graded
modalities in modal logics. In particular, we provide an efficient algorithm
with the complexity $O((m\log{m} + n)\log{n})$ for the considered problem in
that setting.

<p><b>Authors: </b>Ciro Ivan Garcia Lopez <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15600">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>The study of computability has its origin in Hilbert's conference of 1900,
where an adjacent question, to the ones he asked, is to give a precise
description of the notion of algorithm. In the search for a good definition
arose three independent theories: Turing and the Turing machines, G\"odel and
the recursive functions, Church and the Lambda Calculus.
</p>
<p>Later there were established by Kleene that the classic models of computation
are equivalent. This fact is widely accepted by many textbooks and the proof is
omitted since the proof is tedious and unreadable. We intend to fill this gap
presenting the proof in a modern way, without forgetting the mathematical
details.

multiplicative updates of the weights attached to the elements, the greedy

makes the approach attractive for practical problems.

Efficiently
computing such nodes has received a lot of attention. When considering the
generalization of computing central groups of nodes, challenging optimization
problems occur. In this work, we study two such problems, group-harmonic
maximization and group-closeness maximization both from a theoretical and from
an algorithm engineering perspective.
</p>
<p>On the theoretical side, we obtain the following results. For group-harmonic
maximization, unless $P=NP$, there is no polynomial-time algorithm that
achieves an approximation factor better than $1-1/e$ (directed) and $1-1/(4e)$
(undirected), even for unweighted graphs. On the positive side, we show that a
greedy algorithm achieves an approximation factor of $\lambda(1-2/e)$
(directed) and $\lambda(1-1/e)/2$ (undirected), where $\lambda$ is the ratio of
minimal and maximal edge weights. For group-closeness maximization, the
undirected case is $NP$-hard to be approximated to within a factor better than
$1-1/(e+1)$ and a constant approximation factor is achieved by a local-search
algorithm. For the directed case, however, we show that, for any
$\epsilon&lt;1/2$, the problem is $NP$-hard to be approximated within a factor of
$4|V|^{-\epsilon}$.
</p>
<p>From the algorithm engineering perspective, we provide efficient
implementations of the above greedy and local search algorithms. In our
experimental study we show that, on small instances where an optimum solution
can be computed in reasonable time, the quality of both the greedy and the
local search algorithms come very close to the optimum. On larger instances,
our local search algorithms yield results with superior quality compared to
existing greedy and local search solutions, at the cost of additional running
time. We thus advocate local search for scenarios where solution quality is of
highest concern.

interest in the use of point clouds in science and engineering. To facilitate
the computations and analyses of point clouds, prior works have considered
parameterizing them onto some simple planar domains with a fixed boundary shape
such as a unit circle or a rectangle. However, the geometry of the fixed shape
may lead to some undesirable distortion in the parameterization. It is
therefore more natural to consider free-boundary conformal parameterizations of
point clouds, which minimize the local geometric distortion of the mapping
without constraining the overall shape. In this work, we propose a novel
approximation scheme of the Laplace--Beltrami operator on point clouds and
utilize it for developing a free-boundary conformal parameterization method for
disk-type point clouds. With the aid of the free-boundary conformal
parameterization, high-quality point cloud meshing can be easily achieved.
Furthermore, we show that using the idea of conformal welding in complex
analysis, the point cloud conformal parameterization can be computed in a
divide-and-conquer manner. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method.

appeal to three types of discrete curvature, namely the graph Forman-, full

We present the results of experiments on real life networks, as well as for
square grids arising in Image Processing. Moreover, we consider fitting Ricci
flows and we employ them for the detection of networks' backbone. We also
develop embedding kernels related to the Forman-Ricci curvatures and employ
them for the detection of the coarse structure of networks, as well as for
network visualization with applications to SVM. The relation between the Ricci
curvature of the original manifold and that of a Ricci curvature driven
discretization is also studied.

property of a randomized algorithm is preserved when one replaces the atomic
registers that the algorithm uses with linearizable (implementations of)
registers. We show that in general this is not so: roughly speaking, every
randomized algorithm A has a corresponding algorithm A' that solves the same
problem if the registers that it uses are atomic or strongly-linearizable, but
does not terminate if these registers are replaced with "merely" linearizable
ones. Together with a previous result shown in [15], this implies that one
cannot use the well-known ABD implementation of registers in message-passing
systems to automatically transform any randomized algorithm that works in
shared-memory systems into a randomized algorithm that works in message-passing
systems: with a strong adversary the resulting algorithm may not terminate.

<p>A global pandemic, apocalyptic fires, and the possible descent of the US into violent anarchy three days from now can do strange things to the soul.</p>



<p>Bertrand Russell—and if he’d done nothing else in his long life, I’d love him forever for it—once wrote that “in adolescence, I hated life and was continually on the verge of suicide, from which, however, I was restrained by the desire to know more mathematics.”  This summer, unable to bear the bleakness of 2020, I obsessively read up on the celebrated proof of the unsolvability of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis">Continuum Hypothesis</a> (CH) from the standard foundation of mathematics, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory">Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms</a> of set theory.  (In this post, I’ll typically refer to “ZFC,” which means Zermelo-Fraenkel plus the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice">Axiom of Choice</a>.)</p>



<p>For those tuning in from home, the Continuum Hypothesis was formulated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor">Georg Cantor</a>, shortly after his epochal discovery that there are different orders of infinity: so for example, the infinity of real numbers (denoted C for continuum, or \( 2^{\aleph_0} \)) is strictly greater than the infinity of integers (denoted ℵ<sub>0</sub>, or “Aleph-zero”).  CH is simply the statement that there’s no infinity <em>intermediate</em> between ℵ<sub>0</sub> and C: that anything greater than the first is at least the second.  Cantor tried in vain for decades to prove or disprove CH; the quest is believed to have contributed to his mental breakdown.  When David Hilbert presented his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_problems">famous list</a> of 23 unsolved math problems in 1900, CH was at the very top.</p>



<p>Halfway between Hilbert’s speech and today, the question of CH was finally “answered,” with the solution earning the only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal">Fields Medal</a> that’s ever been awarded for work in set theory and logic.  But unlike with any previous yes-or-no question in the history of mathematics, the answer was that there provably <em>is</em> no answer from the accepted axioms of set theory!  You can either have intermediate infinities or not; neither possibility can create a contradiction.  And if you <em>do</em> have intermediate infinities, it’s up to you how many: 1, 5, 17, ∞, etc.</p>



<p>The easier half, the consistency of CH with set theory, was proved by incompleteness dude <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del">Kurt Gödel</a> in 1940; the harder half, the consistency of not(CH), by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Cohen">Paul Cohen</a> in 1963.  Cohen’s work introduced the method of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forcing_(mathematics)">forcing</a>, which was so fruitful in proving set-theoretic questions unsolvable that it quickly took over the whole subject of set theory.  Learning Gödel and Cohen’s proofs had been a dream of mine since teenagerhood, but one I constantly put off.</p>



<p>This time around I started with <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.rmjm/1181070010">Cohen’s retrospective essay</a>, as well as Timothy Chow’s <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/sci.math.research/c/pQdPHJYML0E/m/ZrvqIxpd1sIJ?pli=1">Forcing for Dummies</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1320">A Beginner’s Guide to Forcing</a>.  I worked through Cohen’s own <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Continuum-Hypothesis-Dover-Mathematics/dp/0486469212">Set Theory and the Continuum Hypothesis</a>, and Ken Kunen’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Independence-Studies-Foundations-Mathematics/dp/0444868399">Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Proofs</a>, and <a href="https://www2.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~krajicek/scott67.pdf">Dana Scott’s 1967 paper</a> reformulating Cohen’s proof.  I emailed questions to Timothy Chow, who was ridiculously generous with his time.  When Tim and I couldn’t answer something, we tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_M._Solovay">Bob Solovay</a> (one of the world’s great set theorists, who later worked in computational complexity and quantum computing), or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Blass">Andreas Blass</a> or <a href="http://karagila.org/">Asaf Karagila</a>.  At some point mathematician and friend-of-the-blog <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kuperberg">Greg Kuperberg</a> joined my quest for understanding.  I thank all of them, but needless to say take sole responsibility for all the errors that surely remain in these posts.</p>



<p>On the one hand, the proof of the independence of CH would seem to stand with general relativity, the wheel, and the chocolate bar as a triumph of the human intellect.  It represents a culmination of Cantor’s quest to know the basic rules of infinity—all the more amazing if the answer turns out to be that, in some sense, we <em>can’t</em> know them.</p>



<p>On the other hand, perhaps no other scientific discovery of equally broad interest remains so sparsely popularized, not even (say) quantum field theory or the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem.  I found barely any attempts to explain how forcing works to non-set-theorists, let alone to non-mathematicians.  One notable exception was Timothy Chow’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1320">Beginner’s Guide to Forcing</a>, mentioned earlier—but Chow himself, near the beginning of his essay, calls forcing an “open exposition problem,” and admits that he hasn’t solved it.  My modest goal, in this post and the following ones, is to make a further advance on the exposition problem.</p>



<p>OK, but why a doofus computer scientist like me?  Why not, y’know, an actual expert?  I won’t put forward my ignorance as a qualification, although I <em>have</em> often found that the better I learn a topic, the more completely I forget what initially confused me, and so the less able I become to explain things to beginners.</p>



<p>Still, there is <em>one</em> thing I know well that turns out to be intimately related to Cohen’s forcing method, and that made me feel like I had a small “in” for this subject.  This is the construction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine">oracles</a> in computational complexity theory.  In CS, we like to construct hypothetical universes where P=NP or P≠NP, or P≠BQP, or the polynomial hierarchy is infinite, etc.  To do so, we, by fiat, insert a new function—an <em>oracle</em>—into the universe of computational problems, carefully chosen to make the desired statement hold.  Often the oracle needs to satisfy an infinite list of conditions, so we handle them one by one, taking care that when we satisfy a new condition we don’t invalidate the previous conditions.</p>



<p>All this, I kept reading, is <em>profoundly</em> analogous to what the set theorists do when they create a mathematical universe where the Axiom of Choice is true but CH is false, or vice versa, or any of a thousand more exotic possibilities.  They insert new sets into their models of set theory, sets that are carefully constructed to “force” infinite lists of conditions to hold.  In fact, some of the exact same people—such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_M._Solovay">Solovay</a>—who helped pioneer forcing in the 1960s, later went on to pioneer oracles in computational complexity.  We’ll say more about this connection in a future post.</p>



<p><strong>How Could It Be?</strong></p>



<p>How do you study a well-defined math problem, and return the answer that, as far as the accepted axioms of math can say, there <em>is</em> no answer?  I mean: even supposing it’s <em>true</em> that there’s no answer, how do you <em>prove</em> such a thing?</p>



<p>Arguably, not even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems">Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem</a> achieved such a feat.  Recall, the Incompleteness Theorem says loosely that, for every formal system F that could possibly serve as a useful foundation for mathematics, there exist statements even of elementary arithmetic that are true but unprovable in F—and Con(F), a statement that encodes F’s own consistency, is an example of one.  But the very statement that Con(F) is unprovable is equivalent to Con(F)’s being <em>true</em> (since an inconsistent system could prove anything, including Con(F)).  In other words, if the Incompleteness Theorem as applied to F holds any interest, then that’s only because F <em>is, in fact</em>,<em> consistent</em>; it’s just that resources beyond F are needed to prove this.</p>



<p>Yes, there’s a “self-hating theory,” F+Not(Con(F)), which believes in its own inconsistency.  And yes, by Gödel, this self-hating theory is <em>consistent</em> if F itself is—which means that it has a <em>model</em> (involving “nonstandard integers,” formal artifacts that effectively promise a proof of F’s inconsistency without ever actually delivering it).  But this self-hating theory can’t be <em>arithmetically sound</em>: I mean, just look at it!  It’s either unsound because F is consistent, or else it’s unsound because F is inconsistent.</p>



<p>The independence of CH from the ZFC axioms of set theory is of a fundamentally different kind.  It will give us models of ZFC+CH, and models of ZFC+Not(CH), that are <em>both</em> at least somewhat plausible as “sketches of mathematical reality”—and that both even have defenders.  The question of which is right, or whether it’s possible to decide at all, will be punted to the future: to the discovery (or not) of some intuitively compelling foundation for mathematics that, as Gödel hoped, answers the question by going beyond ZFC.</p>



<p><strong>Four Levels to Unpack</strong></p>



<p>While experts might consider this too obvious to spell out, Gödel’s and Cohen’s analyses of CH aren’t so much about infinity, as they are about our ability to <em>reason </em>about about infinity using finite sequences of symbols.  The game is about building self-contained mathematical universes to order—universes where all the accepted axioms about infinite sets hold true, and yet that, in some cases, seem to mock what those axioms were supposed to <em>mean</em>, by containing vastly fewer objects than the mathematical universe was “meant” to have.</p>



<p>In understanding these proofs, the central hurdle, I think, is that there are at least four different “levels of description” that need to be kept in mind simultaneously.</p>



<p>At the first level, Gödel’s and Cohen’s proofs, like all mathematical proofs, are finite sequences of symbols.  Not only that, they’re proofs that can be formalized in elementary arithmetic (!).  In other words, even though they’re <em>about</em> the axioms of set theory, they don’t themselves <em>require</em> those axioms.  Again, this is possible because, at the end of the day, Gödel’s and Cohen’s proofs won’t be talking about infinite sets, but “only” about finite sequences of symbols that make statements about infinite sets.</p>



<p>At the second level, the proofs are making an “unbounded” but perfectly clear claim.  They’re claiming that, if someone showed you a proof of either CH or Not(CH), from the ZFC axioms of set theory, then no matter how long the proof or what its details, you could convert it into a proof that <em>ZFC itself</em> was inconsistent.  In symbols, they’re proving the “relative consistency statements”</p>



<p>Con(ZFC) ⇒ Con(ZFC+CH),<br />Con(ZFC) ⇒ Con(ZFC+Not(CH)),</p>



<p>and they’re proving these as theorems of <em>elementary arithmetic</em>.  (Note that there’s no hope of proving Con(ZF+CH) or Con(ZFC+Not(CH)) <em>outright</em> within ZFC, since by Gödel, ZFC can’t even prove its own consistency.)</p>



<p>This translation is completely explicit; the independence proofs even yield <em>algorithms</em> to convert proofs of inconsistencies in ZFC+CH or ZFC+Not(CH), supposing that they existed, into proofs of inconsistencies in ZFC itself.</p>



<p>Having said that, as Cohen himself often pointed out, thinking about the independence proofs in terms of algorithms to manipulate sequences of symbols is hopeless: to have any chance of understanding these proofs, let alone coming up with them, at some point you need to think about what the symbols <em>refer</em> to.</p>



<p>This brings us to the third level: the symbols refer to <em>models of set theory</em>, which could also be called “mathematical universes.”  Crucially, we always can and often will take these models to be only <em>countably</em> infinite: that is, to contain an infinity of sets, but “merely” ℵ<sub>0</sub> of them, the infinity of integers or of finite strings, and no more.</p>



<p>(<em>Technical note added:</em> even when our models of ZFC are only countably infinite, they still won’t be countably infinite <em>sets</em>; indeed the ability to construct such a set within ZFC would violate the Incompleteness Theorem.  They’ll instead be “proper classes,” infinite onions that grow more and more sets as we allow more and more instances of ZFC’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_schema_of_replacement">Axiom of Replacement</a>.  More about this in a future post!)</p>



<p>The fourth level of description is from within the models themselves: each model imagines itself to have an <em>uncountable</em> infinity of sets.  As far as the model’s concerned, it comprises the entire mathematical universe, even though “looking in from outside,” we can see that that’s not true.  In particular, each model of ZFC <em>thinks</em> it has uncountably many sets, many themselves of uncountable cardinality, even if “from the outside” the model is countable.</p>



<p>Say what?  The models are <em>mistaken</em> about something as basic as their own size, about how many sets they have?  Yes.  The models will be like <em>The Matrix</em> (the movie, not the mathematical object), or <em>The Truman Show</em>.  They’re self-contained little universes whose inhabitants can never discover that they’re living a lie—that they’re missing sets that we, from the outside, know to exist.  The poor denizens of the Matrix will never even be able to learn that their universe—what<em> </em>they mistakenly think of as <em>the</em> universe—is secretly countable!  And no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheus_(The_Matrix)">Morpheus</a> will ever arrive to enlighten them, although—and this is crucial to Cohen’s proof in particular—the inhabitants will be able to reason more-or-less intelligibly about what would happen if a Morpheus <em>did</em> arrive.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%B6wenheim%E2%80%93Skolem_theorem">Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem</a>, from the early 1920s, says that <em>any</em> countable list of first-order axioms that has any model at all (i.e., that’s consistent), must have a model with at most countably many elements.  And ZFC is a countable list of first-order axioms, so Löwenheim-Skolem applies to it—even though ZFC implies the existence of an uncountable infinity of sets!  Before taking the plunge, we’ll need to not merely grudgingly accept but love and internalize this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skolem%27s_paradox">“paradox,”</a> because pretty much the entire proof of the independence of CH is built on top of it.</p>



<p>Incidentally, once we realize that it’s possible to build self-consistent yet “fake” mathematical universes, we can ask the question that, incredibly, the <em>Matrix</em> movies never ask.  Namely, how do we know that our own, larger universe isn’t similarly a lie?  The answer is that we don’t!  As an example—I hope you’re sitting down for this—even though Cantor proved that there are uncountably many real numbers, that only means there are uncountably many reals <em>for us</em>.  We can’t rule out the possibly that God, looking down on our universe, would see countably many reals.</p>



<p><strong>Cantor’s Proof Revisited</strong></p>



<p>To back up: the whole story of CH starts, of course, with Cantor’s epochal discovery of the different orders of infinity, that for example, there are more subsets of positive integers (or equivalently real numbers, or equivalently infinite binary sequences) than there are positive integers.  The devout Cantor thought his discovery illuminated the nature of God; it’s never been entirely obvious to me that he was wrong.</p>



<p>Recall how Cantor’s proof works: we suppose by contradiction that we have an enumeration of all infinite binary sequences: for example,</p>



<p>s(0) = <strong>0</strong>0000000…<br />s(1) = 0<strong>1</strong>010101…<br />s(2) = 11<strong>0</strong>01010….<br />s(3) = 100<strong>0</strong>0000….</p>



<p>We then produce a new infinite binary sequence that’s not on the list, by going down the diagonal and flipping each bit, which in the example above would produce 1011…</p>



<p>But look more carefully.  What Cantor really shows is only that, <em>within our mathematical universe</em>, there can’t be an enumeration of all the reals of our universe.  For if there were, we could use it to define a new real that was in the universe but not in the enumeration.  The proof doesn’t rule out the possibility that <em>God</em> could enumerate the reals of our universe!  It only shows that, if so, there would need to be additional, heavenly reals that were missing from even God’s enumeration (for example, the one produced by diagonalizing against <em>that</em> enumeration).</p>



<p>Which reals could possibly be “missing” from our universe?  Every real you can name—42, π, √e, even uncomputable reals like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaitin%27s_constant">Chaitin’s Ω</a>—has to be there, right?  Yes, and there’s the rub: <em>every real you can name</em>.  Each name is a finite string of symbols, so whatever your naming system, you can only ever name countably many reals, leaving 100% of the reals nameless.</p>



<p>Or did you think of only the <em>rationals</em> or <em>algebraic numbers</em> as forming a countable dust of discrete points, with numbers like π and e filling in the solid “continuum” between them?  If so, then I hope you’re sitting down for this: <em>every real number you’ve ever heard of</em> belongs to the countable dust!  The entire concept of “the continuum” is only needed for reals that don’t have names and never will.</p>



<p><strong>From ℵ<sub>0</sub> Feet</strong></p>



<p>Gödel and Cohen’s achievement was to show that, without creating any contradictions in set theory, we can adjust size of this elusive “continuum,” put more reals into it or fewer.  How does one even start to begin to prove such a statement?</p>



<p>From a distance of ℵ<sub>0</sub> feet, Gödel proves the consistency of CH by building minimalist mathematical universes: one where “the only sets that exist, are the ones <em>required</em> to exist by the ZFC axioms.”  (These universes can, however, differ from each other in how “tall” they are: that is, in how many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number">ordinals</a> they have, and hence how many sets overall.  More about that in a future post!)  Gödel proves that, <em>if</em> the axioms of set theory are consistent—that is, if they describe any universes at all—then they also describe these minimalist universes.  He then proves that, in any of these minimalist universes, from the standpoint of someone <em>within</em> that universe, there are exactly ℵ<sub>1</sub> real numbers, and hence CH holds.</p>



<p>At an equally stratospheric level, Cohen proves the consistency of not(CH) by building … well, <em>non</em>-minimalist mathematical universes!  A simple way is to start with Gödel’s minimalist universe—or rather, an even more minimalist universe than his, one that’s been cut down to have only countably many sets—and then to stick in a bunch of <em>new real numbers</em> that weren’t in that universe before.  We choose the new real numbers to ensure two things: first, we still have a model of ZFC, and second, that we make CH false.  The details of how to do that will, of course, concern us later.</p>



<p><strong>My Biggest Confusion</strong></p>



<p>In subsequent posts, I’ll say more about the character of the ZFC axioms and how one builds models of them to order.  Just as a teaser, though, to conclude this post I’d like to clear up a fundamental misconception I had about this subject, from roughly the age of 16 until a couple months ago.</p>



<p>I thought: the way Gödel proves the consistency of CH, must be by examining all the sets in his minimalist universe, and checking that each one has either at most ℵ<sub>0</sub> elements or else at least C of them.  Likewise, the way Cohen proves the consistency of not(CH), must be by “forcing in” some extra sets, which have more than ℵ<sub>0</sub> elements but fewer than C elements.</p>



<p>Except, it turns out that’s not how it works.  Firstly, to prove CH in his universe, Gödel is not going to check each set to make sure it doesn’t have intermediate cardinality; instead, he’s simply going to count all the reals to make sure that there are only ℵ<sub>1</sub> of them—where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_number#Aleph-one">ℵ<sub>1</sub></a> is the next infinite cardinality after ℵ<sub>0</sub>.  This will imply that C=ℵ<sub>1</sub>, which is another way to state CH.</p>



<p>More importantly, to build a universe where CH is false, Cohen is going to start with a universe where C=ℵ<sub>1</sub>, like Gödel’s universe, and then <em>add in more reals:</em> say, ℵ<sub>2</sub> of them.  The ℵ<sub>1</sub> “original” reals will then supply our set of intermediate cardinality between the ℵ<sub>0</sub> integers and the ℵ<sub>2</sub> “new” reals.</p>



<p>Looking back, the core of my confusion was this.  I had thought: I can visualize what ℵ<sub>0</sub> means; that’s just the infinity of integers.  I can <em>also</em> visualize what \( C=2^{\aleph_0} \) means; that’s the infinity of points on a line.  Those, therefore, are the two bedrocks of clarity in this discussion.  By contrast, I <em>can’t</em> visualize a set of intermediate cardinality between ℵ<sub>0</sub> and C.  The intermediate infinity, being weird and ghostlike, is the one that shouldn’t exist unless we deliberately “force” it to.</p>



<p>Turns out I had things backwards.  For starters, I <em>can’t</em> visualize the uncountable infinity of real numbers.  I might <em>think</em> I’m visualizing the real line—it’s solid, it’s black, it’s got little points everywhere—but how can I be sure that I’m not merely visualizing the ℵ<sub>0</sub> rationals, or (say) the computable or definable reals, which include all the ones that arise in ordinary math?</p>



<p>The continuum C is <em>not at all</em> the bedrock of clarity that I’d thought it was.  Unlike its junior partner ℵ<sub>0</sub>, the continuum is adjustable, changeable—and we <em>will</em> change it when we build different models of ZFC.  What’s (relatively) more “fixed” in this game is something that I, like many non-experts, had always given short shrift to: Cantor’s sequence of Alephs ℵ<sub>0</sub>, ℵ<sub>1</sub>, ℵ<sub>2</sub>, etc.</p>



<p>Cantor, who was a very great man, didn’t merely discover that C&gt;ℵ<sub>0</sub>; he also discovered that the infinite cardinalities form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-order">well-ordered</a> sequence, with no infinite descending chains.  Thus, after ℵ<sub>0</sub>,  there’s a next greater infinity that we call ℵ<sub>1</sub>; after ℵ<sub>1</sub> comes  ℵ<sub>2</sub>; after the entire infinite sequence ℵ<sub>0</sub>,ℵ<sub>1</sub>,ℵ<sub>2</sub>,ℵ<sub>3</sub>,… comes ℵ<sub>ω</sub>; after ℵ<sub>ω</sub> comes ℵ<sub>ω+1</sub>; and so on.  These infinities will always be there in any universe of set theory, and always in the same order.</p>



<p>Our job, as engineers of the mathematical universe, will include pegging the continuum C to one of the Alephs.  If we stick in a bare minimum of reals, we’ll get C=ℵ<sub>1</sub>, if we stick in more we can get C=ℵ<sub>2</sub> or C=ℵ<sub>3</sub>, etc.  We can’t make C equal to ℵ<sub>0</sub>—that’s Cantor’s Theorem—and we <em>also</em> can’t make C equal to ℵ<sub>ω</sub>, by an important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6nig%27s_theorem_(set_theory)">theorem of König</a> that we’ll discuss later (yes, this is an umlaut-heavy field).  But it will turn out that we can make C equal to just about any other Aleph: in particular, to any infinity other than ℵ<sub>0</sub> that’s not the supremum of a countable list of smaller infinities.</p>



<p>In some sense, this is the whole journey that we need to undertake in this subject: from seeing the cardinality of the continuum as a metaphysical mystery, which we might contemplate by staring really hard at a black line on white paper, to seeing the cardinality of the continuum <em>as an engineering problem</em>.</p>



<p>Stay tuned!  Next installment coming after the civilizational Singularity in three days, assuming there’s still power and Internet and food and so forth.</p>



<p>Oh, and happy Halloween.  Ghostly sets of intermediate cardinality … spoooooky!</p></div>

<p>With election on my mind, and constantly looking at polls and predictions, I thought I would look a little more into how election models are made. (<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am not an expert statistician / pollster and this is based on me trying to read their methodological description as well as looking into results of simulations in Python. However, there is a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GaoBn71PwIk_uAisNWzp2Naqev9JHW0I?usp=sharing">colab notebook</a> so you can try this on your own!)</p>



<p>If polls were 100% accurate, then we would not need election models – we will know that the person polling at more than 50% in a given state will win, and we can just sum up the electoral votes. However, polls have various sources of errors:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Statistical sample error</strong> –  this is simply the deviation between the fraction of people that would say “I will vote for X” at time T in the population, and the empirical fraction reported by the poll based on their sample. As battleground states get polled frequently with large samples, this error is likely to be negligible.</li><li><strong>Sampling bias</strong> – this is the bias incurred by the fact that we cannot actually sample a random subset of the population and get them to answer our questions – the probability that people will pick up their phone may be correlated with their vote. Pollsters hope that these correlations all disappear once you condition on certain demographic variables (race, education, etc..) and so try to ensure the sample is balanced according to these metrics. I believe this was part of the reason that polls were off in 2016, since they didn’t explicitly adjust for levels of education (which were not strongly correlated with party before) and ended up under-representing white voters without college degrees.</li><li><strong>Lying responses or “shy” voters</strong> – Some people suggest that voters lie to pollsters because their choice is considered “socially undesirable”. There is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-supporters-arent-shy-but-polls-could-still-be-missing-some-of-them/">not much support</a> that this is a statistically significant effect. In particular <a href="https://morningconsult.com/form/shy-trump-2020/">one study</a> showed there was no statistically significant difference between responders’ responses in online and live calling. Also in  2016 polls equally under-estimated the votes for Trump and Republican senators (which presumably didn’t have the same “social stigma” to them).</li><li><strong>Turnout estimates</strong> – Estimating the probability that a person supporting candidate X will actually show up to vote (or mail it in) is a bit of a dark art, and account for the gap in polls representing registered voters (which make no such estimates) and polls representing likely voters (which do). Since traditionally the Republican electorate is older and more well off, they tend to vote more reliably and hence likely voter estimates are typically better for republicans. The effect seems not to be very strong this year. Turnout might be particularly hard to predict this year, though it seems likely to be historically high.</li><li><strong>Voters changing their mind</strong> –  The poll is done at a given point in time and does not necessarily reflect voters views in election day. For example in 2016 it seems that many undecided voters broke for Trump. In this cycle the effect might be less pronounced since there are few undecided voters and “election day” is smoothed over a 2-4 week period due to early and mail-in voting.</li></ol>



<p>To a first approximation, a poll-based election model does the following:<br /><br />1. Aggregates polls into national and state-wise predictions </p>



<p>2. Computes a probability distribution over the correlated error vectors (i.e. the vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvec%7Be%7D&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\vec{e}" class="latex" title="\vec{e}" />  with coordinate for each jurisdiction containing the deviation from the prediction)</p>



<p>3. Samples from the probability distribution over vectors to obtain probabilities over outcomes.</p>



<p>From a skim of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-2020-presidential-forecast-works-and-whats-different-because-of-covid-19/">538’s methodology</a> it seems that they do the following:</p>



<ol><li>Aggregate polls (weighing by quality, timeliness, adjusting for house effects, etc..). Earlier in the election cycle they also mix in “fundamentals” such as state of the economy etc.. though their weight decreases with time.</li><li>Estimate magnitude of national error (i.e., sample a value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D_%2B&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="E \in \mathbb{R}_+" class="latex" title="E \in \mathbb{R}_+" /> according to some distribution that reflects the amount of national uncertainty.</li><li>(This is where I may be understanding wrong.) Sample a vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvec%7Be%7D&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\vec{e}" class="latex" title="\vec{e}" /> whose entries sum up to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="E" class="latex" title="E" /> according to a correlated distribution, where the correlations between states depends on demographic, location, and other  factors. For each particular choice of $E$, because the sum is fixed, if a state has $E+X$ bias then on average the other states will need to compensate for this $-X$ bias, and hence this can create <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/10/24/reverse-engineering-the-problematic-tail-behavior-of-the-fivethirtyeight-presidential-election-forecast/">negative correlations</a> between states. (It is not clear that negative correlations are unreasonable – one could imagine policies that are deeply popular with population A and deeply unpopular with population B)</li></ol>



<p>From a skim of the <a href="https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president/how-this-works">Economist’s methodology</a> it seems that they do the following:</p>



<ol><li>They start again with some estimate on the national popular vote, based on polls and fundamentals, and then assume it is distributed according to some probability distribution to account for errors.</li><li>They then compute some prior on “partisan lean” (difference between state and national popular vote) for each state. If we knew the popular vote and partisan lean perfectly then we would know the result. Again like good Bayesians they assume that the lean is distributed according to some probability distribution.</li><li>They update the prior based on state polls and other information</li><li>They sample from an error distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvec%7Be%7D&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\vec{e}" class="latex" title="\vec{e}" /> according to some explicit pairwise correlation matrix that has only non-negative entries (and hence you don’t get negative correlations in their model).</li></ol>



<p>So, given all of the above, how much do these models differ? Perhaps surprisingy, the answer is “not by much”.  To understand how they differ, I plotted for both models the following: </p>



<ol><li>The histogram of Biden’s popular vote margin</li><li>The probability of Biden to win conditioned on a particular margin</li></ol>



<p>Much of the methodological difference, including the issue of pairwise correlations, should manifest in 2, but eyeballing it, they don’t seem to differ that much. It seems that conditioned on a particular margin, both models give Biden similar probability to win. (In particular both models think that 3% margin is about 50/50, while 4% margin gives Biden about 80/20 chance). The main difference is actually in the first part of estimating the popular vote margin – 538 is more “conservative” and has fatter tails.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/election_models.png"><img src="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/election_models.png?w=993" alt="" class="wp-image-7867" /></a></figure>



<p>If you want to check my data, see if I have a bug, or try your own analysis, you can use this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GaoBn71PwIk_uAisNWzp2Naqev9JHW0I?usp=sharing">colab notebook</a>.</p>



<h2>“Make your own needle”</h2>



<p>Another applications for such models is to help us adjust the priors as new information comes in. For example, it’s possible that Florida, North Carolina and Texas will report results early. If Biden loses one of these states, should we adjust our estimate of win probability significantly? It turns out that the answer depends on by how much he loses.</p>



<p>The following graphs show the updated win probability conditioned on a particular margin in a state. We see that winning or losing Florida, North Carolina, and Texas on their own doesn’t make much difference to the probability – it’s all about the margin. In contrast, losing Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes will make a significant difference to Biden’s chances.</p>

<p>(The non monotonicity is simply a side effect of having a finite number of simulation runs and would disappear in the limit.)</p></div>

<p>In May 2016, after Donald Trump was elected as the republican nominee for president, I wrote the following blog post. I ended up not publishing it – this has always been a technical blog (and also more of a group blog, at the time).  While the damage of a Donald Trump presidency was hypothetical at the time, it is now very real and in a second term the stakes are only higher. I once again hope American readers of this blog would do what they can to support Joe Biden.<br /></p>



<p>Note: this is not an invitation for a debate on who to vote for in the comments. At this point, if you are educated and following the news (as I imagine all readers of this blog are) then if you are not already convinced that Donald Trump is a danger to this country and the world, nothing I will say will change your mind. Similarly, nothing you will say will change mine. Hence this is just a call for those readers who already support Joe Biden to make sure they vote and think of how they can help with their money or time in other ways.</p>



<h2>I’m with Her</h2>



<p><strong>Boaz Barak / May 3, 2016</strong><br /><br />The republican electorate, in their infinite wisdom, have just (essentially) finalized the election of Donald Trump as their nominee for the position of the president of the United States.</p>



<p>While I have my political views, I don’t consider myself a very political person, and have not (as far as I remember) ever written about politics in this blog. However, extreme times call for extreme measures. It is tempting to be fatalist or cynical about this process, and believe that whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton is elected doesn’t make much of a difference. Some people believe that the presidency shapes the person more than the other way around, and others feel that all politicians are anyway corrupt or that Hillary is not much better than trump since she voted for the Iraq war and gave paid speeches for Wall Street firms. I think the last two presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama demonstrated that the identity of the president makes a huge difference. All evidence points out that with Trump this difference will be entirely in the negative direction.</p>



<p>While his chances might not be great, this is not a bet I’m comfortable taking. I plan to support Hillary Clinton as much as I can, and hope that other American readers of this blog will do the same</p></div>

<p class="wp-block-quote">Abstract: I will present a new approach to randomized lower bounds, particularly in the setting where we wish to give a fine-grained analysis of randomized algorithms that achieve small bias. The approach is as follows: instead of considering ordinary randomized algorithms which give an output in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\{0,1\}" class="latex" title="\{0,1\}" /> and may err, we switch models to look at “forecasting” randomized algorithms which output a confidence in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C1%5D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="[0,1]" class="latex" title="[0,1]" /> for whether they think the answer is 1. When scored by a proper scoring rule, the performance of the best forecasting algorithm is closely related to the bias of the best (ordinary) randomized algorithm, but is more amenable to analysis. <br />As an application, I’ll present a new minimax theorem for randomized algorithms, which can be viewed as a strengthening of Yao’s minimax theorem. Yao’s minimax theorem guarantees the existence of a hard distribution for a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> such that solving <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> against this distribution (to a desired error level) is as hard as solving <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> in the worst case (to that same error level). However, the hard distribution provided by Yao’s theorem depends on the chosen error level. Our minimax theorem removes this dependence, giving a distribution which certifies the hardness of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> against all bias levels at once. In recent work, we used this minimax theorem to give a tight composition theorem for randomized query complexity. <br /><br />Based on joint work with Eric Blais.</p></div>

My annual fall jobs posts, giving advice to PhDs looking for faculty positions, were getting repetitive. See <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/10/2019-fall-jobs-post.html">last year's post</a> for the usual stuff and feel free to post opportunities in the comments on this post. This year let's talk about what's changed.<div><br /></div><div>First something you might have missed--the latest <a href="https://cra.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2019-Taulbee-Survey.pdf">Taulbee Survey</a> shows a small drop in the number of new undergraduate CS majors in 2019 after years of massive growth. Is it a simple blip or have we hit the saturation point? We may never know because of the change you definitely didn't miss seeing.</div><div><br /></div><div>So let's talk about the effect of COVID. We're seeing a large drop in new international students who are having a hard time getting visas or just avoiding the US like the plague (literally). Not sure those numbers will fully come back given other alternatives and a changing international relationship particularly with China. Many undergrads have delayed college and some may never attend. </div><div><br /></div><div>On the other hand, COVID has accelerated digitizing the economy, from videoconferencing to in-home entertainment and games to remote access to work environments. The post-COVID economy could create even a larger demand for computer scientists. </div><div><br /></div><div>Many universities curtailed hiring last year worried and may do so in the spring given the uncertain budget situation due to the virus. Others continue to hire in computing, some to make up for last year. I just can't make a prediction for the upcoming year but I wouldn't rush to the job market if you have the option to wait. Last year the CRA reinstated the <a href="https://cifellows2020.org/">CIFellows</a>, postdocs to help those in a tight job market, and may do so again next year. The CRA will also repeat its <a href="https://cra.org/cras-cv-database-initiative-turns-two/">CV database</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>Late spring interviews in 2020 went virtual and will likely go virtual again in 2021. Nevertheless take the zoom meetings seriously. Make sure your interview talk is still a discussion--answer questions people give in the chat. Still do your research to have strong conversations with everyone you talk to, especially the non-theorists. And still dress nicely, at least from the waist up. Putting on a sports coat is not a bad idea. </div><div><div><br /></div><div>Though most places continue to focus on data science/ML, cybersecurity and to some degree quantum, Rutgers is <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/about/employment/details/tenure-track-assistant-professor-position-2">specifically looking</a> for a hire in computational complexity. Don't see that everyday. </div></div></div>

<p>No that is not the amount of the US debt, or the new relief bill. It is the fraction by which the hallowed 44-year-old upper bound of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1.5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1.5}" class="latex" title="{1.5}" /> on the approximation ratio of the metric Traveling Salesperson Problem has been improved. With the help of randomization, we hasten to add.</p>
<p>
Today we discuss the larger meaning of their tiny breakthrough.<br />
<span id="more-17726"></span></p>
<p>
The abstract of their <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01409">paper</a> is as pithy as can be:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> For some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+%3E+10%5E%7B-36%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\epsilon &gt; 10^{-36}}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon &gt; 10^{-36}}" /> we give a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%2F2+-+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{3/2 - \epsilon}" class="latex" title="{3/2 - \epsilon}" /> approximation algorithm for metric TSP. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Metric TSP means that the cost of the tour <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28v_1%2Cv_2%2C%5Cdots%2Cv_n%2Cv_1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{(v_1,v_2,\dots,v_n,v_1)}" class="latex" title="{(v_1,v_2,\dots,v_n,v_1)}" /> is the sum of the distances of the edges </p>

Sanjeev Arora and Joseph Mitchell jointly won the 2002 Gödel Prize for their randomized algorithms doing exactly that. The rub is the constant in the “<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{O(1)}" class="latex" title="{O(1)}" />” depends on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\delta}" class="latex" title="{\delta}" />—indeed, nobody knows how to make it scale less than linearly in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cdelta%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\frac{1}{\delta}}" class="latex" title="{\frac{1}{\delta}}" />. But for general metrics, getting within a factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%281%2B%5Cdelta%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{(1+\delta)}" class="latex" title="{(1+\delta)}" /> is known to be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" />-hard for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\delta}" class="latex" title="{\delta}" /> up to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B122%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\frac{1}{122}}" class="latex" title="{\frac{1}{122}}" />.</p>

Some intermediate cases of metrics had <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.1870">allowed</a> getting within a factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1.4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1.4}" class="latex" title="{1.4}" />, but for general metrics the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1.5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1.5}" class="latex" title="{1.5}" /> factor <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a025602.pdf">found</a> in 1976 by the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/196798/obituary-nicos-christofides-1942-2019/">late</a> Nicos Christofides, and <a href="http://nas1.math.nsc.ru/aim/journals/us/us17/us17_007.pdf">concurrently</a> by Anatoliy Serdyukov, stood like a brick wall. Well, we didn’t expect it to be a brick wall at first. Let me tell a story.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> A Proof in a Pub </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Soon after starting as a graduate student at Oxford in 1981, I went with a bunch of dons and fellow students down to London for a one-day workshop where Christofides was among the speakers and presented his result along with newer work. I’d already heard it spoken of as a combinatorial gem and perfect motivator for a graduate student to appreciate the power of combining simplicity and elegance:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Calculate the (or a) minimum spanning tree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T}" class="latex" title="{T}" /> of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> given points. <p></p>
</li><li>
Take <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> to be the leaves and any other odd-degree nodes of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T}" class="latex" title="{T}" /> and calculate a minimum matching <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" title="{M}" /> of them. <p></p>
</li><li>
The graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%2BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T+M}" class="latex" title="{T+M}" /> has all nodes of even degree so it has an easily-found Eulerian cycle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_E%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{C_E}" class="latex" title="{C_E}" />. <p></p>
</li><li>
The cycle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_E%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{C_E}" class="latex" title="{C_E}" /> may repeat vertices, but by the triangle inequality for the distance metric <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mu}" class="latex" title="{\mu}" />, we can bypass repeats to create a Hamilton cycle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{C_H}" class="latex" title="{C_H}" /> giving <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu%28C_H%29+%5Cleq+%5Cmu%28C_E%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mu(C_H) \leq \mu(C_E)}" class="latex" title="{\mu(C_H) \leq \mu(C_E)}" />.
</li></ol>
<p>
Now any optimal TSP tour <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_O%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{C_O}" class="latex" title="{C_O}" /> arises as a spanning tree plus an edge, so <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu%28T%29+%3C+%5Cmu%28C_O%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mu(T) &lt; \mu(C_O)}" class="latex" title="{\mu(T) &lt; \mu(C_O)}" />. And <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_O%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{C_O}" class="latex" title="{C_O}" /> can be partitioned into two sets of paths with endpoints in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />. One of those sets has weight at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cmu%28C_O%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\frac{1}{2}\mu(C_O)}" class="latex" title="{\frac{1}{2}\mu(C_O)}" /> and yet matches all pairs of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />. Thus <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu%28M%29+%5Cleq+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cmu%28C_O%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mu(M) \leq \frac{1}{2}\mu(C_O)}" class="latex" title="{\mu(M) \leq \frac{1}{2}\mu(C_O)}" />. It follows that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu%28C_H%29+%5Cleq+%5Cmu%28T%29+%2B+%5Cmu%28M%29+%3C+%5Cmu%28C_0%29+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cmu%28C_0%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mu(C_H) \leq \mu(T) + \mu(M) &lt; \mu(C_0) + \frac{1}{2}\mu(C_0)}" class="latex" title="{\mu(C_H) \leq \mu(T) + \mu(M) &lt; \mu(C_0) + \frac{1}{2}\mu(C_0)}" /> and we’re done.</p>
<p>
My memory of what we did after the workshop is hazy but I’m quite sure we must have gone to a pub for dinner and drinks before taking the train back up to Oxford. My point is, the above proof is <em>the kind that can be told and discussed in a pub</em>. It combines several greatest hits of the field: minimum spanning tree, perfect matching, Euler tour, Hamiltonian cycle, triangle inequality. The proof needs no extensive calculation; maybe a napkin to draw <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{C_0}" class="latex" title="{C_0}" /> and the partition helps. </p>
<p>
The conversation would surely have gone to the question,</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Can the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1.5%5C%3B%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1.5\;}" class="latex" title="{1.5\;}" /> factor be beaten? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
A perfect topic for mathematical pub conversation. Let’s continue as if that’s what happened next—I wish I could recall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Trees That Snake Around </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Note that the proof already “beats” it in the sense of there being a strict inequality, and it really shows </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmu%28C_H%29+%5Cleq+%281.5+-+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%29%5Cmu%28C_0%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \mu(C_H) \leq (1.5 - \frac{1}{n})\mu(C_0). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \mu(C_H) \leq (1.5 - \frac{1}{n})\mu(C_0). " /></p>
<p>The advantage <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\frac{1}{n}}" class="latex" title="{\frac{1}{n}}" /> shrinks to zero as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> grows, however. Moreover, examples where Christofides’s algorithm does no better than approach <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1.5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1.5}" class="latex" title="{1.5}" /> are easy to draw. Pub walls are often covered with emblems of local organizations, and if one has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caduceus">caduceus</a> symbol it can serve as the drawing:</p>

The staff is a path <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T}" class="latex" title="{T}" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> nodes while the snakes alternate edges of weight <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1+%2B+%5Cgamma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1 + \gamma}" class="latex" title="{1 + \gamma}" /> between nodes two apart on the path.

The extra weight is reckoned as the length of one snake, which <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csim+n%5Cfrac%7B1%2B%5Cgamma%7D%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\sim n\frac{1+\gamma}{2}}" class="latex" title="{\sim n\frac{1+\gamma}{2}}" />, so the ratio approaches <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B3%7D%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\frac{3}{2}}" class="latex" title="{\frac{3}{2}}" /> as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cgamma+%5Crightarrow+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\gamma \rightarrow 0}" class="latex" title="{\gamma \rightarrow 0}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Crightarrow+%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n \rightarrow \infty}" class="latex" title="{n \rightarrow \infty}" />. Here are some tantalizing aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn-2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n-2}" class="latex" title="{n-2}" /> snake edges, plus one path edge to connect them, make a <em>maximum</em>-weight spanning tree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T'}" class="latex" title="{T'}" /> in the graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" /> formed by the two kinds of edges. Yet <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T'}" class="latex" title="{T'}" /> followed by the same steps 2–4 of Christofides’s algorithm would yield and optimum tour. <p></p>
</li><li>
When one is given only the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> points plus the <em>graph metric</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mu}" class="latex" title="{\mu}" /> induced by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" />, not <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" /> itself, then there are much worse spanning trees. The single edge connecting the endpoints <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28v_1%2Cv_n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{(v_1,v_n)}" class="latex" title="{(v_1,v_n)}" /> of the previous path has weight <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu%28v_1%2Cv_n%29+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7Bn%7D%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mu(v_1,v_n) \approx \frac{n}{2}}" class="latex" title="{\mu(v_1,v_n) \approx \frac{n}{2}}" />. <p></p>
</li><li>
Thus <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T'}" class="latex" title="{T'}" /> has relatively low weight compared to these possible other trees. And its weight approaches that of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T}" class="latex" title="{T}" /> as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cgamma+%5Crightarrow+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\gamma \rightarrow 0}" class="latex" title="{\gamma \rightarrow 0}" />. This means that small changes in the size of the tree yield large changes in the quality of the induced tour. <p></p>
</li><li>
The advantage of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T'}" class="latex" title="{T'}" /> is that its odd-valence nodes have small distance under <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mu}" class="latex" title="{\mu}" />. As a path it snakes around so that its ends are near each other, unlike those of the minimum spanning tree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T}" class="latex" title="{T}" />. This raises the question of weighting spanning trees according to a slightly different measure <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mu'}" class="latex" title="{\mu'}" /> that incorporates a term for “<em>odd-closeness</em>.”
</li></ul>
<p>
In 1981, we would not have known about Arora’s and Mitchell’s results, so we would have felt fully on the frontier by embedding the points in the plane and sketching spanning trees and cycles on a piece of paper. After a couple pints of ale we might have felt sure that a simple proof with such evident slack ought to yield to a more sophisticated attack. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Helpful Trees </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
There is one idea that we might have come up with in a pub. The motivation for choosing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T}" class="latex" title="{T}" /> to be a minimum spanning tree is that many of its edges go into the Euler tour <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_E%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{C_E}" class="latex" title="{C_E}" /> and those bound the final <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_O%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{C_O}" class="latex" title="{C_O}" /> even if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_O%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{C_O}" class="latex" title="{C_O}" /> shortcuts them. So making the total edge weight of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T}" class="latex" title="{T}" /> minimum seems to be the best way to help at that stage. We might have wondered, however, whether there is a way to create <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T}" class="latex" title="{T}" /> to have a stronger direct relation to good tours, if not to the optimal tour. </p>
<p>
Oveis Gharan did have such an idea jointly with a different group of authors a decade ago, in the <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shayan/atsp.pdf">best paper</a> of SODA 2010. We cannot seem to get our hands on the optimal tour, nor even a “good” tour if that means a better than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1.5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1.5}" class="latex" title="{1.5}" /> factor approximation—that is what we are trying to find to begin with. But there is another “tour” <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%5E%2A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{O^*}" class="latex" title="{O^*}" /> that we <em>can</em> compute. This is an optimum of the <em>linear programming relaxation</em> of TSP, whose relation to the exact-TSP methods of Michael Held and Dick Karp we <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/05/08/inexact-remarks-on-exact-tsp-algorithms/">covered</a> long back. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%5E%2A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{O^*}" class="latex" title="{O^*}" /> is not a single tour but rather an ensemble of “fractional tours” where each edge <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{e}" class="latex" title="{e}" /> has a rational number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{z_e}" class="latex" title="{z_e}" /> representing its contribution to the LP solution. The higher <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{z_e}" class="latex" title="{z_e}" />, the more helpful the edge.</p>
<p>
The objective then becomes to design distributions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Ccal+T%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{{\cal T}}" class="latex" title="{{\cal T}}" /> of spanning trees <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T}" class="latex" title="{T}" /> so that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Sampling <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT+%5Cleftarrow+%7B%5Ccal+T%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T \leftarrow {\cal T}}" class="latex" title="{T \leftarrow {\cal T}}" /> is polynomial-time efficient. <p></p>
</li><li>
For every edge <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{e}" class="latex" title="{e}" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPr_%7BT+%5Cleftarrow+%7B%5Ccal+T%7D%7D%5Be+%5Cin+T%5D+%5Cpropto+%281+%2B+%5Cdelta_n%29+z_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\Pr_{T \leftarrow {\cal T}}[e \in T] \propto (1 + \delta_n) z_e}" class="latex" title="{\Pr_{T \leftarrow {\cal T}}[e \in T] \propto (1 + \delta_n) z_e}" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\delta_n}" class="latex" title="{\delta_n}" /> is tiny. <p></p>
</li><li>
The distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Ccal+T%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{{\cal T}}" class="latex" title="{{\cal T}}" /> promotes trees <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T}" class="latex" title="{T}" /> with fewer leaves and odd-valence interior nodes.
</li></ol>
<p>
The algorithmic strategy this fits into is to sample <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T}" class="latex" title="{T}" /> from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Ccal+T%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{{\cal T}}" class="latex" title="{{\cal T}}" />, plug <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T}" class="latex" title="{T}" /> into the first step of the Christofides algorithm, and continue as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Proof and the Pudding </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The first two conditions are solidly defined. Considerable technical details in the SODA 2010 paper and another <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shayan/tsp.pdf">paper</a> at FOCS 2011 that was joint with Amin Saberi and Mohit Singh are devoted to them. A third desideratum is that the distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Ccal+T%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{{\cal T}}" class="latex" title="{{\cal T}}" /> not be over-constrained but rather have maximum entropy, so that for efficiently computable numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\lambda_e}" class="latex" title="{\lambda_e}" /> approaching <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{z_e}" class="latex" title="{z_e}" /> one has also: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5CPr_%7B%5Ccal+T%7D%28T%29+%5Cpropto+%5Cprod_%7Be+%5Cin+T%7D%5Clambda_e.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \Pr_{\cal T}(T) \propto \prod_{e \in T}\lambda_e. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \Pr_{\cal T}(T) \propto \prod_{e \in T}\lambda_e. " /></p>
<p>The third condition, however, follows the <a href="https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/proof-of-the-pudding.html">maxim</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “the proof of the pudding is in the eating.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
As our source makes clear, this does not refer to American-style dessert pudding, but rather savory British pub fare going back to 1605 at least. The point is that we ultimately know a choice of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Ccal+T%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{{\cal T}}" class="latex" title="{{\cal T}}" /> is good by proving it gives a better approximation factor than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B3%7D%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\frac{3}{2}}" class="latex" title="{\frac{3}{2}}" />.</p>
<p>
In America, we tend to say the maxim a different way:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “the proof is in the pudding.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The new paper uses the “pudding” from the 2011 paper but needed to deepen the proof. Here is where we usually say to refer to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01409">paper</a> for the considerable details. But in this case we find that a number of the beautiful concepts laid out in the paper’s introduction, such as <em>real stability</em> and <em>strong Rayleigh distributions</em>, are more accessibly described in the notes for the first half of a <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shayan/courses/polynomials/">course</a> taught last spring by Oveis Gharan with Klein as TA. One nub is that if a set of complex numbers all have positive imaginary part, then any product <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz+%3D+z_1+z_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{z = z_1 z_2}" class="latex" title="{z = z_1 z_2}" /> of two of the numbers has real part less than the product of the real parts, and if the latter product is positive, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{z}" class="latex" title="{z}" /> is not a real number.  This rules out assignments drawn from the set from being solutions to certain polynomials as well as setting up odd/even parity properties elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Rigidity of the TSP Universe </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I’ll close instead with some remarks while admitting that my own limited time—I have been <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.5769434">dealing</a> with more chess <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/16/chesss-cheating-crisis-paranoia-has-become-the-culture">cases</a>—prevents them from being fully informed. </p>
<p>
The main remark is to marvel that the panoply of polynomial properties and deep analysis buy such a tiny improvement. It is hard to believe that the true space of TSP approximation methods is so <em>rigid</em>. In this I am reminded of Scott Aaronson’s <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2651">calculations</a> that a collision of two stellar black holes a mere 3,000 miles away would stretch space near you by only a millimeter. There is considerable belief that the approximation factor ought to be improvable at least as far as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B4%7D%7B3%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\frac{4}{3}}" class="latex" title="{\frac{4}{3}}" />.</p>
<p>
It strikes me that the maximum-entropy condition, while facilitating the analysis, works against the objective of making the trees more special. It cannot come near the kind of snaky tree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT_O%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T_O}" class="latex" title="{T_O}" /> obtained by deleting any edge from a good tour <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{O}" class="latex" title="{O}" />, such that plugging <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT_O%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T_O}" class="latex" title="{T_O}" /> into step 1 yields <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{O}" class="latex" title="{O}" /> back again. The theory of polynomials and distributions that they develop has a plug-and-play element, so that they can condition the distributions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Ccal+T%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{{\cal T}}" class="latex" title="{{\cal T}}" /> toward the third objective using the parity properties. But their framework has inflexibility represented by needing to postulate a real-valued function on the optimum edges whose expectation is of order the <em>square</em> of a parameter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ceta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\eta}" class="latex" title="{\eta}" /> already given the tiny value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B10%5E%7B-12%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{10^{-12}}" class="latex" title="{10^{-12}}" />. Of the requirement that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ceta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\eta}" class="latex" title="{\eta}" /> be a small fraction of their governing epsilon parameter, they say in section 3:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> This forces us to take <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ceta%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\eta}" class="latex" title="{\eta}" /> very small, which is why we get only a “very slightly” improved approximation algorithm for TSP. Furthermore, since we use OPT edges in our construction, we don’t get a new upper bound on the integrality gap. We leave it as an open problem to find a reduction to the “cactus” case that doesn’t involve using a slack vector for OPT (or a completely different approach). </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
What may be wanting is a better way of getting the odd-valence tree nodes to be closer, not just fewer in number. To be sure, ideas for “closer” might wind up presupposing a metric topology on the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> given points, leading to cases that have already been improved by other means.</p>

<p>This is the second of two posts describing the theory and practice of reconstruction attacks.  To read the first post, which covers the theoretical basis of such attacks, <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/reconstruction-theory/">[click here]</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/reconstruction-theory/">last post</a>, we discussed how an attacker can use noisy answers to questions about a database to reconstruct private information in the database. The reconstruction attack framework was:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The attacker submits sufficiently random queries that link prior information (which the attacker already knows) to private data (which the attacker wants to learn).</li>
  <li>The attacker receives noisy answers to these queries and writes them down as constraints for a linear program to solve for the private bits.</li>
  <li>The attacker solves the linear program and rounds the result to recover most of the bits.</li>
</ol>

<p>Our last post discussed some of this attack’s nice theoretical guarantees, and this post matches that with real-world performance. More specifically, we’ll cover two successful applications of this attack against a piece of anonymizing SQL software called Diffix which, despite the name, is not differentially private.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-diffix">What is Diffix?</h3>
<p>Diffix is a system designed by the startup Aircloak for answering statistical queries over a private database. It is described by its creators as an “anonymizing SQL interface [that] sits in front of your data and enables you to conduct ad hoc analytics — fully privacy preserving and GDPR-compliant.”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>  Aircloak’s approach is to develop targeted defenses for known vulnerabilities, but to otherwise privilege utility over protecting against unknown vulnerabilities.  They combine this approach with a serious effort to actually find vulnerabilities in Diffix through periodic bug bounties that offer monetary prizes for participants who mount successful attacks.  While this post is critical of the design of Diffix itself, we commend Aircloak for their genuine openness to scrutiny. Indeed, the attacks described in this post were carried out as a part of these bug bounty programs and led to the discovery of several vulnerabilities in the software that have since been addressed. The first attack we describe was carried out by Aloni Cohen and Kobbi Nissim in the first bug bounty program in late 2017 and early 2018.  The second was run by Travis Dick, Matthew Joseph, and Zachary Schutzman in the second bug bounty program during the summer of 2020.</p>

<p>Before diving into the details of the attacks, we’ll first introduce the basic functionality of Diffix and how it purports to defend against vulnerabilities, including linear reconstruction attacks.  The goal of Diffix is to answer SQL queries, such as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-SQL">SELECT COUNT(*) FROM loans
WHERE loanStatus = 'C'
AND clientId BETWEEN 2000 and 3000
</code></pre>
<p>on a database while preventing the disclosure of record-level data.<br />
A challenge for a system like Diffix is to answer such counting queries while preventing an adversarial user—the attacker—from learning record-level information. As you might remember from the last post, such a system must not provide exact answers to arbitrary queries. Otherwise the attacker could mount a <em>differencing attack</em>. For example, an attacker who knows that Billy Joel’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clientID</code> is 2744 could learn the status of the singer’s loan by comparing the answer to the previous query with the answer to:</p>

<pre><code class="language-SQL">SELECT COUNT(*) FROM loans
WHERE loanStatus = 'C'
AND clientId BETWEEN 2000 and 3000
AND clientId != 2744
</code></pre>

<p>An intuitive defense is to add noise to the answer—say, Gaussian noise sampled from \(N(0,10)\).
Now the difference \(\Delta\) in the responses to the two queries is a random variable sampled from \(N(1,20)\) or \(N(0,20)\) depending on whether Joel’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loanStatus</code> is or isn’t <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C</code>.
With just one sample, the distributions are hard to distinguish.</p>

<p>Still, this scheme is easily thwarted by <em>averaging attacks</em>.
If the noise is sampled anew each time a query is made, then repeatedly making the same pair of queries generates many independent samples from \(N(1,20)\) or \(N(0,20)\), and enough queries would make it possible to distinguish these distributions easily.</p>

<p>As before, there is an intuitive defense: use the same noise for repeated queries.  This defense introduces its own new attacks by making many syntactically-distinct but semantically-equivalent queries.  Those attacks in turn suggest new defenses which suggest new attacks, and so on.  Diffix is, in a sense, the result of this hypothetical arms race.</p>

<p>From a technical perspective, Diffix consists of three components, which together are intended to thwart these attacks.  First, Diffix only accepts a limited subset of SQL and will categorically reject any query that does not fit this subset.  These restrictions—including tight restrictions on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JOIN</code>s and on the number of mathematical functions in a single expression—limit the ability of an adversary to use the full power of SQL to access the database.  The second component is a collection of data-dependent ad-hoc methods to prevent leaking information about individuals or very small subsets of users, including suppressing answers to queries about small numbers of users and flattening outliers.</p>

<p>The final component is Diffix’s layered noise.  This noise is comprised of two individual noise terms added together: a <em>data-dependent</em> term whose variance is constant<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> and a <em>query-dependent</em> term whose variance depends on the complexity of the query. The data-dependent noise prevents naïve averaging attacks. It is a pseudorandom error where the seed of the pseudorandom function depends on individual data records that contribute to the query result. Semantically equivalent queries using different syntax will nonetheless share this error, so simply averaging the responses will not remove this noise.</p>

<p>The query-dependent noise prevents a naïve Dinur–Nissim style reconstruction attacks. A noise term of magnitude \(\Omega(1)\) is generated deterministically for each condition in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WHERE</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HAVING</code> clause of the SQL query, and the terms are added together.  A Dinur–Nissim query is a random subset of the dataset that contains \(\Omega(n)\) records. The straightforward way of specifying such a query is to enumerate the subset record by record using \(\Omega(n)\) conditions:<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<pre><code class="language-SQL">SELECT COUNT(*) FROM loans
WHERE loanStatus = 'C'
AND (clientId = 2007
OR clientId = 2018
...
OR clientId = 2991)

</code></pre>

<p>A query with \(\Omega(n)\) conditions is answered with noise with standard deviation \(\Omega(\sqrt{n})\), enough to thwart efficient reconstruction algorithms.</p>

<h3 id="carrying-out-reconstruction">Carrying out reconstruction</h3>
<p>The additional noise per SQL condition  is the main obstacle to running a successful reconstruction attack on a database behind Diffix.  As described above, the noise prevents the naive implementation of the reconstruction algorithm from receiving accurate enough answers to reconstruct the database using a reasonable number of queries.<br />
A natural approach is to use very few SQL conditions—ideally, just one—to make random-enough queries, each identifying a subset of the records in the dataset.
So the challenge is to formulate a large family of such queries that are accepted by Diffix’s restricted subset of SQL, using as few conditions as possible.</p>

<h4 id="the-cohennissim-attack">The Cohen–Nissim Attack</h4>

<p>Instead of specifying each row with a separate condition, the Cohen–Nissim attack<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05692">[CN18]</a> uses an ad hoc <em>hash function</em> to extract entropy from the data itself in order to systematically choose the needed subsets.<br />
Suppose we have a list of the values in the database’s  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clientId</code> column, and we want to recover the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loanStatus</code> secret bit. Rather than explicitly enumerating the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clientId</code>s for a random subset of the rows to include in each query, we can write a boolean-valued function which evaluates to true on about half of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clientId</code>s and ask Diffix to include only the rows for which the condition is true.  In this way, instead of first choosing a subset of rows and then asking Diffix about those rows, we choose this function and use its evaluation to specify our random subset.</p>

<p>After some experimentation with the language restrictions, Cohen and Nissim settled on the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-SQL">...
WHERE FLOOR(100 * ((clientId * 2)^0.7))
   = FLOOR(100 * ((clientId * 2)^0.7) + 0.5)
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s see what this does. Let \(d=d_0.d_1 d_2 d_3 d_4 \dots \) be the decimal representation of the value \(d = (\mathtt{clientID}\cdot 2)^{0.7}\), which appears on both sides of the equality.
The expression is true if and only if \(d_3 &lt; 5\).<br />
To see this, the left hand side evaluates to \(d_{0}d_{1}d_{2} = \lfloor 100d \rfloor\); the right hand side evaluates to \(d_{0}d_{1}d_{2}\) if \(d_3 &lt; 5\)  or \(d_{0}d_{1}d_{2}+1\) if \(d_3 \geq 5\). In the former case, the equality condition evaluates to ‘true’, and in the latter case it evaluates to ‘false’. Replacing 100 with other powers of 10 changes which digit in the decimal expansion is checked.</p>

<p>By varying the constants in the SQL query, this single expression yields a whole family of conditions, albeit a very ad-hoc one.  The hope was that, for different primes \(q\) and fractional exponents \(p\), the individual digits of the decimal representations of \((\mathtt{clientID}*q)^p\) would be random enough for reconstruction to work.
The complete attack queries looked like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-SQL">
SELECT COUNT(clientId) FROM loans
WHERE FLOOR(100 * ((clientId * 2)^.7))  
    = FLOOR(100 * ((clientId * 2)^.7) + 0.5)
AND clientId BETWEEN 2000 and 3000
AND loanStatus = 'C'

</code></pre>

<p>The range condition at the end simply selects a subset of the data which is small enough for the attack to run quickly on a personal computer but large enough to satisfy the requirements of the Diffix bounty program.  This family of queries allows for a linear program to reconstruct the secret <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loanStatus</code> bits with high accuracy.</p>

<p>In the course of verifying the attack for the Diffix bounty program, reconstruction was carried out on 4 different ranges of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clientId</code>s containing 455 records. For each record, the attack correctly determined whether or not the corresponding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loanStatus</code> was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C</code>.</p>

<p>Aircloak’s response to this attack was to further restrict the queries allowed by Diffix.  Columns like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clientId</code>, where most of the values correspond to a single user, are tagged as ‘isolating’, and mathematical functions can no longer be used on such columns.  The hope was that this modification would prevent the extraction of entropy from an identifying column via hashing.</p>

<h4 id="the-dickjosephschutzman-attack">The Dick–Joseph–Schutzman Attack</h4>

<p>Without the ability to directly use a uniquely identifying column from the database itself, we need another way to single out rows of the database.  We can use an idea that’s been around since the 1990s, when  Latanya Sweeney showed<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> that almost 90 percent of Americans could be identified with only a date of birth, ZIP code, and gender, but of course each of these alone is nowhere near sufficient to isolate a single individual.  We can use this idea and try to evade the modification to Diffix by choosing multiple non-isolating columns which, when taken together, can isolate rows in the database.</p>

<p>This modified attack uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pickup_latitude</code> column in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">taxi</code> data set as the source of entropy, which is non-isolating, in part because there are a large number of rows where the value is recorded as zero.  We can combine this column with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trip_distance</code> column and run queries of the following form:</p>

<pre><code class="language-SQL">
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rides
WHERE FLOOR(pickup_latitude ^  8.789 + 0.5)
    = FLOOR(pickup_latitude ^  8.789)
AND trip_distance IN (0.87, 1.97, 2.75)
AND payment_type = 'CSH'

</code></pre>

<p>This example query is part of an attack to recover the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">payment_type</code> column, which (for the purposes of this attack) is a binary column containing two values: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CRD</code> (for credit card payments) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CSH</code> (for cash payments).  The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IN (0.87, 1.97, 2.75)</code> restricts to a subset of the data with about 450 rows, each with a distinct value for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pickup_latitude</code>.  However, because across the whole database, very few rows have a distinct value in this column, Diffix does not consider it ‘isolating’ and it can be used as Cohen–Nissim used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clientId</code>.  The values in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pickup_latitude</code> are recorded to six decimal places of precision and the least significant four of them are essentially random digits.  By choosing an appropriate range for the exponent and using the same trick as in the Cohen–Nissim attack, allows the construction of a Diffix-accepted query which includes around half of the rows in the targeted subset. Using different values for the exponent leads to a large family of queries which allow the attack to be carried out as before with similarly high accuracy of over 95 percent.</p>

<p>Dick–Joseph–Schutzman additionally extends this attack to recover <em>numerical</em> rather than just binary secret data.  By using queries of the form</p>

<pre><code class="language-SQL">SELECT SUM(passenger_count) FROM rides ...

</code></pre>
<p>Diffix will return return noisy sums over the specified subset for a numeric column like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">passenger_count</code>.  Then, a similar linear program can reconstruct estimates for these values with high accuracy.  For numeric columns like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">passenger_count</code> which take on relatively few distinct values, the attack recovers the exact values with accuracy above 75 percent.  Due to limitations in the Diffix bounty program rules which require perfect reconstruction of a value to be considered ‘accurate’, we didn’t evaluate the performance of the attack on numeric columns with richer values, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dropoff_latitude</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, this attack extends to one used to reconstruct string data character-by-character.  A U.S. social security number consists of a string formatted like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xxx-xx-xxxx</code> with none unknown digits in three blocks separated by dashes.  There are potentially one billion different strings that could appear in this column.  However, by exploiting the structure of the data, a separate attack can be run to recover each digit individually using the summation attack, since there are only ten different values each digit could take.  Queries of the form</p>

<pre><code class="language-SQL">
SELECT SUM(CAST(SUBSTRING(ssn, 3, 1) AS integer)) FROM rides ....

</code></pre>

<p>can be used to recover the 3rd digit from each row’s social security number.  Running this attack for each digit then aggregating the individual guesses to construct a guess for each user’s entire social security number allows the attack to achieve perfect reconstruction on about 90 percent of the values.  A similar attack worked on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pickup_datetime</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dropoff_datetime</code> columns, with separate attacks on the value in the seconds position, the minutes position, and so on, and finally piecing these together to correctly reconstruct about 85 percent of the values.</p>

<p>Again, Aircloak’s response was to restrict the query language.  Both of the successful attacks relied on the use of some arithmetic inside of  a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FLOOR</code> function to check whether or not a row is included in a particular query. Diffix now forbids the use of arithmetic with <em>bucketing functions</em> such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FLOOR</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CEIL</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ROUND</code>, etc.  This defeats strategies which choose random-ish subsets via this kind of hashing, but does not necessarily preclude the extraction of entropy from the data in other ways.</p>

<h4 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h4>

<p>We’d again like to thank Aircloak for opening their system to attacks and critiques through the Diffix bounty program.  By being so willing to expose their product in this way, they have provided a test bed for us to bridge the gap between theory and application and demonstrate how a linear reconstruction attack might work in practice.  Vulnerability to these and other attacks are a potential threat to any data privacy system which does not account for the cumulative threat to privacy that may result from many seemingly-innocuous queries, not just Diffix. The attacks we describe here only require the attacker have access to some subset of the data with a sufficient amount of entropy, and while more entropy allows for more complete reconstruction, it may be possible to use something potentially very accessible like a list of users’ email addresses in this kind of attack to reconstruct a non-trivial amount of the secret data using queries against a system that adds independent noise to each query.  Systems like this fall into the trap of the classic arms race, where a designer builds a system to protect against certain attacks, then a clever and determined adversary defeats the system, and the designer is forced to make revisions.  This cycle may never terminate, leaving us perpetually unsure of when we can be confident that a system is secure enough to trust with sensitive data.</p>

This paper focuses on a variant of the circuit minimization problem (MCSP), denoted MKTP, which studies resource-bounded Kolmogorov complexity in place of circuit size. MCSP is not known to be hard for any complexity class under any kind of m-reducibility, but recently MKTP was shown to be hard for DET under m-reductions computable in NC0, by presenting an AC0 reduction from the rigid graph isomorphism problem to MKTP, and combining that with a theorem of Toran, showing that DET AC0-reduces to the rigid graph isomorphism problem, and then appealing to the "Gap Theorem" of [Agrawal, Allender, Rudich]. Here, we show that these reductions can be accomplished by means of projections. Thus MKTP is hard for DET under projections, and the rigid graph isomorphism problem is hard for DET under uniform projections.</div>
