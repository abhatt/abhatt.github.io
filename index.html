specific focus on peak hours: Given a set of drivers and rider requests, we aim
to match drivers to each rider request by achieving two objectives: maximizing
the served rate and minimizing the total additional distance, subject to a
series of spatio-temporal constraints. Our problem can be distinguished from
existing work in three aspects: (1) Previous work did not fully explore the
impact of peak travel periods where the number of rider requests is much
greater than the number of available drivers. (2) Existing solutions usually
rely on single objective optimization techniques, such as minimizing the total
travel cost. (3) When evaluating the overall system performance, the runtime
spent on updating drivers' trip schedules as per incoming rider requests should
be incorporated, while it is excluded by most existing solutions. We propose an
index structure together with a set of pruning rules and an efficient algorithm
to include new riders into drivers' existing trip schedule. To answer new rider
requests effectively, we propose two algorithms that match drivers with rider
requests. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on a large-scale test
collection to validate the proposed methods.

lottery over envy-free up to one item (EF1) deterministic allocations. It has
the following advantages over a recently proposed algorithm: it does not rely
on the linear programming machinery including separation oracles; it is
SD-efficient (both ex-ante and ex-post); and the ex-ante outcome is equivalent
to the outcome returned by the well-known probabilistic serial rule. As a
result, we answer a question raised by Freeman, Shah, and Vaish (2020) whether
the outcome of the probabilistic serial rule can be implemented by ex-post EF1
allocations. In the light of a couple of impossibility results that we prove,
our algorithm can be viewed as satisfying a maximal set of properties. Under

polynomial-time 3/2-approximation algorithm for the metric traveling salesman
problem. It was presented by Christofides in 1976 and is well known as "the
Christofides algorithm". Recently, some authors started calling it
"Christofides-Serdyukov algorithm", pointing out that the same result was
published independently in the USSR in 1978. We provide some historic

profile of a discrete distribution, i.e., the probability of observing the
multiset of element frequencies, and computing a profile maximum likelihood
(PML) distribution, i.e., a distribution with the maximum profile likelihood.
For each problem we provide polynomial time algorithms that given $n$ i.i.d.\
samples from a discrete distribution, achieve an approximation factor of
$\exp\left(-O(\sqrt{n} \log n) \right)$, improving upon the previous best-known
bound achievable in polynomial time of $\exp(-O(n^{2/3} \log n))$ (Charikar,
Shiragur and Sidford, 2019). Through the work of Acharya, Das, Orlitsky and
Suresh (2016), this implies a polynomial time universal estimator for symmetric
properties of discrete distributions in a broader range of error parameter.
</p>
<p>We achieve these results by providing new bounds on the quality of
approximation of the Bethe and Sinkhorn permanents (Vontobel, 2012 and 2014).
We show that each of these are $\exp(O(k \log(N/k)))$ approximations to the
permanent of $N \times N$ matrices with non-negative rank at most $k$,
improving upon the previous known bounds of $\exp(O(N))$. To obtain our results
on PML, we exploit the fact that the PML objective is proportional to the
permanent of a certain Vandermonde matrix with $\sqrt{n}$ distinct columns,
i.e. with non-negative rank at most $\sqrt{n}$. As a by-product of our work we
establish a surprising connection between the convex relaxation in prior work
(CSS19) and the well-studied Bethe and Sinkhorn approximations.

analytic or tabulated nonlinear functions in assigned ranges of interest. The
proposed approach is based on an optimal version of the k-vector range
searching, an ad-hoc modification devised for function inversion. The
optimality consists of retrieving always the same number of data ($1,2,\dots$)
for a specified searching range to initiate the root solver. This provides
flexibility to adapt the technique to a variety of root solvers (e.g.,
bisection, Newton, etc.), using a specified number of starting points. The
proposed method allows to build an inverse function toolbox for a set of
specified nonlinear functions. In particular, the method is suitable when
intensive inversions of the same function are required. The inversion is
extremely fast (almost instantaneous), but it requires a one-time preprocessing
effort.

two unrooted phylogenetic trees. It is NP-hard to compute, and very few
positive algorithmic results are known due to its complex combinatorial
structure. Here we address this shortcoming by showing that the problem is
fixed parameter tractable. We do this by establishing a linear kernel i.e.,
that after applying certain reduction rules the resulting instance has size
that is bounded by a linear function of the distance. As powerful corollaries
to this result we prove that the problem permits a polynomial-time
constant-factor approximation algorithm; that the treewidth of a natural
auxiliary graph structure encountered in phylogenetics is bounded by a function
of the distance; and that the distance is within a constant factor of the size
of a maximum agreement forest of the two trees, a well studied object in
phylogenetics.

learning algorithm used for either classification or regression. KNN prediction
efficiency highly depends on the size of its training data but when this
training data grows KNN suffers from slowness in making decisions since it
needs to search nearest neighbors within the entire dataset at each decision
making. This paper proposes a new technique that enables the selection of
nearest neighbors directly in the neighborhood of a given observation. The
proposed approach consists of dividing the data space into subcells of a
virtual grid built on top of data space. The mapping between the data points
and subcells is performed using hashing. When it comes to select the nearest
neighbors of a given observation, we firstly identify the cell the observation
belongs by using hashing, and then we look for nearest neighbors from that
central cell and cells around it layer by layer. From our experiment
performance analysis on publicly available datasets, our algorithm outperforms
the original KNN in time efficiency with a prediction quality as good as that
of KNN it also offers competitive performance with solutions like KDtree

participants and support economic activity of billions of dollars, which has
led to new lines of work in binary Byzantine Agreement (BBA) and consensus. The
new work aims to achieve communication-efficiency---given such a large $n$, not
everyone can speak during the protocol. Several protocols have achieved
consensus with communication-efficiency, even under an adaptive adversary, but
they require additional strong assumptions---proof-of-work, memory-erasure,
etc. All of these protocols use multicast: every honest replica multicasts
messages to all other replicas. Under this model, we provide a new
communication-efficient consensus protocol using Verifiable Delay Functions
(VDFs) that is secure against adaptive adversaries and does not require the
same strong assumptions present in other protocols.
</p>
<p>A natural question is whether we can extend the synchronous protocols to the
partially synchronous setting---in this work, we show that using multicast, we
cannot. Furthermore, we cannot achieve always safe communication-efficient
protocols (that maintain safety with probability 1) even in the synchronous
setting against a static adversary when honest replicas only choose to
multicast its messages. Considering these impossibility results, we describe a
new communication-efficient BBA protocol in a modified partially synchronous
network model which is secure against adaptive adversaries with high
probability.

July 17, 2020, Budapest, Hungary<br />
At the 21st ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (ACM EC ’20)</span></div>
<div><span>**In the event the in-person conference does not happen due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will hold the workshop virtually.</span></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">SUBMISSIONS DUE May 18, 2020, 11:59pm PDT.</span></strong></div>

<div></div>
<div><strong>Call for Papers: the 2nd Workshop on Behavioral Economics and Computation</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div><span>We solicit research contributions and participants for the 2nd Workshop on Behavioral Economics and Computation, to be held in conjunction with the Twenty-First ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (ACM EC ’20). </span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span>Based on the successful workshop last year, we aim to bring together again researchers and practitioners from diverse subareas of EC, who are interested in the intersection of human economic behavior and computation, to share new results and to discuss future directions for behavioral research related to economics and computation. It will be a full-day workshop, and will feature invited speakers, contributed paper presentations and a panel discussion. </span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span>The gap between rationality-based analysis that assumes utility-maximizing agents and actual human behavior in the real world has been well recognized in economics, psychology and other social sciences. In recent years, there has been growing interest in conducting behavioral research across many of the sub-areas related to economics and computation to address this gap. In one direction, some of these studies leverage insights on human decision making from the behavioral economics and psychology literature to study economic and computational systems with human users. In the other direction, computational tools are used to study and gain insights on human behavior and a data-driven approach is used to learn behavior models from user-generated data.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
The 2nd Behavioral EC workshop aims to provide a venue for researchers and practitioners from diverse fields, including but not limited to computer science, economics, psychology and sociology, to exchange ideas related to behavioral research in economics and computation. In addition to sharing new results, we hope the workshop will foster a lively discussion of future directions and methodologies for behavioral research related to economics and computation as well as fruitful cross-pollination of behavioral economics, cognitive psychology and computer science. </span></div>
<div><span><br />
We welcome studies at the intersection of economic behavior and computation from a rich set of theoretical, experimental and empirical perspectives. The topics of interest for the workshop are behavioral research in all settings covered by EC, including but not limited to:</span></div>
<ul>
<li><span>Behavioral mechanism design and applied mechanism design</span></li>
<li><span>Boundedly-rational models of economic decision making</span></li>
<li><span>Empirical studies of human economic behavior</span></li>
<li><span>Model evaluation and selection based on behavioral data</span></li>
<li><span>Data-driven modelling</span></li>
<li><span>Online prediction markets, online experiments, and crowdsourcing platforms</span></li>
<li><span>Hybrid human-machine systems</span></li>
<li><span>Models and experiments about social considerations (e.g. fairness and trust) in decision making</span></li>
<li><span>Methods for behavioral EC: information aggregation, probability elicitation, quality control</span></li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<div></div>

road network is essential to many location-based services. Road networks are
dynamic in the sense that the weights of the edges in the corresponding graph
constantly change over time, representing evolving traffic conditions. Very
often such services have to process numerous KSP queries over large road
networks at the same time, thus there is a pressing need to identify
distributed solutions for this problem. However, most existing approaches are
designed to identify KSPs on a static graph in a sequential manner (i.e., the
(i+1)-th shortest path is generated based on the i-th shortest path),
restricting their scalability and applicability in a distributed setting. We
therefore propose KSP-DG, a distributed algorithm for identifying k-shortest
paths in a dynamic graph. It is based on partitioning the entire graph into
smaller subgraphs, and reduces the problem of determining KSPs into the
computation of partial KSPs in relevant subgraphs, which can execute in
parallel on a cluster of servers. A distributed two-level index called DTLP is
developed to facilitate the efficient identification of relevant subgraphs. A
salient feature of DTLP is that it indexes a set of virtual paths that are
insensitive to varying traffic conditions, leading to very low maintenance cost
in dynamic road networks. This is the first treatment of the problem of
processing KSP queries over dynamic road networks. Extensive experiments
conducted on real road networks confirm the superiority of our proposal over
baseline methods.

subgraph of $H\boxtimes P$, where $\boxtimes$ denotes the strong graph product,
$H$ is a graph of treewidth 8 and $P$ is a path. This result has found numerous
applications to linear graph layouts, graph colouring, and graph labelling. The
proof given by Dujmovi\'c et al is based on a similar decomposition of
Pilipczuk and Siebertz (SODA2019) which is constructive and leads to an
$O(n^2)$ time algorithm for finding $H$ and the mapping from $V(G)$ onto
$V(H\boxtimes P)$. In this note, we show that this algorithm can be made to run
in $O(n\log n)$ time.

Boolean functions that subsumes the famous Ordered Binary Decision Diagram
(OBDD) as a strict subset. SDDs are attracting much attention because they are
more succinct than OBDDs, as well as having canonical forms and supporting many
useful queries and transformations such as model counting and Apply operation.
In this paper, we propose a more succinct variant of SDD named Variable Shift
SDD (VS-SDD). The key idea is to create a unique representation for Boolean
functions that are equivalent under a specific variable substitution. We show
that VS-SDDs are never larger than SDDs and there are cases in which the size
of a VS-SDD is exponentially smaller than that of an SDD. Moreover, despite
such succinctness, we show that numerous basic operations that are supported in
polytime with SDD are also supported in polytime with VS-SDD. Experiments
confirm that VS-SDDs are significantly more succinct than SDDs when applied to
classical planning instances, where inherent symmetry exists.

DNA adjacent to its original position. More formally, a tandem duplication can
be thought of as an operation that converts a string $S = AXB$ into a string $T
= AXXB,$ and is denoted by $S \Rightarrow T.$ As they appear to be involved in
genetic disorders, tandem duplications are widely studied in computational
biology. Also, tandem duplication mechanisms have been recently studied in
different contexts, from formal languages, to information theory, to
error-correcting codes for DNA storage systems.
</p>
<p>The problem of determining the complexity of computing the tandem duplication
distance between two given strings was proposed by [Leupold et al., 2004] and,
very recently, it was shown to be NP-hard for the case of unbounded alphabets
[Lafond et al., 2019]. In this paper, we significantly improve this result and
show that the tandem duplication "distance problem" is NP-hard already for the
case of strings over an alphabet of size $\leq 5.$ We also consider the
"existence problem": given strings $S$ and $T$ over the same alphabet, decide
whether there exists a sequence of duplications converting $S$ into $T$. A
polynomial time algorithm that solves this (existence) problem was only known
for the case of the binary alphabet. We focus on a special class of
strings---here referred to as "purely alternating"---that generalize the
special structure of binary strings to larger alphabets. We show that for the
case of purely alternating strings from an alphabet of size $\leq 5$, the
existence problem can be solved in linear time.

an algorithm devised to perform orthogonal range searching in static databases
with multiple dimensions. The methodology first finds the order in which to
search the dimensions, and then, performs the search using a modified
projection method. In order to determine the dimension order, the algorithm
uses the k-vector, a range searching technique for one dimension that
identifies the number of elements contained in the searching range. Then, using
this information, the algorithm predicts and selects the best approach to deal
with each dimension. The algorithm has a worst case complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(nd(k/n)^{2/d})$, where $k$ is the number of elements retrieved,
$n$ is the number of elements in the database, and $d$ is the number of
dimensions of the database. This work includes a detailed description of the
methodology as well as a study of the algorithm performance.

stochastic algorithms have drawn significant attention in the present
days.~While the synchronous versions of these algorithms are well understood in
terms of their convergence, the convergence analyses of their asynchronous
counterparts are not widely studied. In this paper, we propose and analyze a
{\it distributed, asynchronous parallel} SGD in light of solving an arbitrary
consistent linear system by reformulating the system into a stochastic
optimization problem as studied by Richt\'{a}rik and Tak\'{a}\~{c} in [35]. We
compare the convergence rates of our asynchronous SGD algorithm with the
synchronous parallel algorithm proposed by Richt\'{a}rik and Tak\'{a}\v{c} in
[35] under different choices of the hyperparameters---the stepsize, the damping
factor, the number of processors, and the delay factor. We show that our
asynchronous parallel SGD algorithm also enjoys a global linear convergence
rate, similar to the {\em basic} method and the synchronous parallel method in
[35] for solving any arbitrary consistent linear system via stochastic
reformulation. We also show that our asynchronous parallel SGD improves upon
the {\em basic} method with a better convergence rate when the number of
processors is larger than four. We further show that this asynchronous approach
performs asymptotically better than its synchronous counterpart for certain
linear systems. Moreover, for certain linear systems, we compute the minimum
number of processors required for which our asynchronous parallel SGD is
better, and find that this number can be as low as two for some ill-conditioned
problems.

applications to biological phenomena such as gene regulation. In many contexts,
the order in which entities update their state is unknown, and the dynamics may
be very sensitive to changes in this schedule of updates. Since the works of
Aracena et. al, it is known that update digraphs are pertinent objects to study
non-equivalent block-sequential update schedules. We prove that counting the
number of equivalence classes, that is a tight upper bound on the synchronism
sensitivity of a given network, is #P-complete. The problem is nevertheless
computable in quasi-quadratic time for oriented cacti, and for oriented
series-parallel graphs thanks to a decomposition method.

<p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/i/Iliopoulos:Fotis.html">Fotis Iliopoulos</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02066">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>All known efficient algorithms for constraint satisfaction problems are
stymied by random instances. For example, no efficient algorithm is known that
can q-color a random graph with average degree (1 + \epsilon)q \ln q, even
though random graphs remain q-colorable for average degree up to (2-o(1)) q \ln
q. Similar failure to find solutions at relatively low constraint densities is
known for random CSPs such as random k-SAT and other hypergraph-based problems.
The constraint density where algorithms break down for each CSP is known as the
"algorithmic barrier" and provably corresponds to a phase transition in the
geometry of the space of solutions [Achlioptas and Coja-Oghlan 2008]. In this
paper we aim to shed light on the following question: Can algorithmic success
up to the barrier for each CSP be ascribed to some simple deterministic
property of the inputs?
</p>
<p>We answer this question positively for graph coloring by identifying the
property of \emph{girth-reducibility}. We prove that every girth-reducible
graph of average degree (1-o(1) )q \ln q is efficiently q-colorable and that
the threshold for girth reducibility of random graphs coincides with the
algorithmic barrier. Thus, we link the tractability of graph coloring up to the
algorithmic barrier to a single deterministic property. Our main theorem
actually extends to coloring k-uniform hypergraphs. As such, we believe that it
is an important first step towards discovering the structural properties behind
the tractability of arbitrary k-CSPs for constraint densities up to the
algorithmic barrier.

Shinichi Mochizuki is about to have his proof of the ABC conjecture <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/mathematicians-shocked-paper-published">published</a> in a journal. The proof needs more than a ream of paper—that is, it is over 500 pages long. </p>
<p>
Today I thought we would discuss his claimed proof of this famous conjecture.</p>
<p>
The decision to published is also discussed in an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00998-2">article</a> in <em>Nature</em>. Some of the discussion we have seen <a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=11709">elsewhere</a> has been about personal factors. We will just comment briefly on the problem, the proof, and how to tell if a proof has problems. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Problem </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Number theory is hard because addition and multiplication do not play well together. Adding numbers is not too complex by its self; multiplication by its self is also not too hard. For those into formal logic the theory of addition for example is decidable. So in principle there is no hard problem that only uses addition. None. A similar point follows for multiplication. </p>
<p>
But together addition and multiplication is hard. Of course Kurt Gödel proved that the formal theory of arithmetic is hard. It is not complete, for example. There must be statements about addition and multiplication that are unprovable in Peano Arithmetic. </p>
<p>
The ABC conjecture states a property that is between addition and multiplication. Suppose that 	</p>

<p>for some integers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1+%5Cle+A+%5Cle+B+%5Cle+C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1 \le A \le B \le C}" class="latex" title="{1 \le A \le B \le C}" />. Then 	</p>

<p>is trivial. The ABC conjecture says that one can do better and get 	</p>

<p>for a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28X%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F(X)}" class="latex" title="{F(X)}" /> that is sometimes much smaller than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" />. The function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28X%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F(X)}" class="latex" title="{F(X)}" /> depends not on the size of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> but on the multiplicative structure of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" />. That is the function depends on the multiplicative structure of the integers. Note, the bound 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++C+%5Cle+ABC+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  C \le ABC " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  C \le ABC " /></p>
<p>only needed that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%2CB%2CC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A,B,C}" class="latex" title="{A,B,C}" /> were numbers larger than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />. The stronger bound 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++C+%5Cle+F%28ABC%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  C \le F(ABC), " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  C \le F(ABC), " /></p>
<p>relies essentially on the finer structure of the integers. </p>
<p>
Roughly <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28X%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F(X)}" class="latex" title="{F(X)}" /> operates as follows: Compute all the primes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" /> that divide <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" />. Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Q}" class="latex" title="{Q}" /> be the product of all these primes. Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28X%29+%5Cle+Q%5E%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F(X) \le Q^{2}}" class="latex" title="{F(X) \le Q^{2}}" /> works: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++C+%5Cle+Q%5E%7B2%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  C \le Q^{2}. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  C \le Q^{2}. " /></p>
<p>The key point is: <i>Even if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5E%7B100%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p^{100}}" class="latex" title="{p^{100}}" />, for example, divides <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" />, we only include <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" /> in the product <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Q}" class="latex" title="{Q}" />.</i> This is where the savings all comes from. This is why the ABC conjecture is hard: repeated factors are thrown away.</p>
<p>
Well not exactly, there is a constant missing here, the bound is 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++C+%5Cle+%5Calpha+Q%5E%7B2%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  C \le \alpha Q^{2} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  C \le \alpha Q^{2} " /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%3E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\alpha&gt;0}" class="latex" title="{\alpha&gt;0}" /> is a universal constant. We can replace <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%5E%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Q^{2}}" class="latex" title="{Q^{2}}" /> by a smaller number—the precise statement can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abc_conjecture">here</a>. This is the ABC conjecture. </p>
<p>
The point here is that in many cases <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28ABC%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F(ABC)}" class="latex" title="{F(ABC)}" /> is vastly smaller than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BABC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{ABC}" class="latex" title="{ABC}" /> and so that inequality 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++C+%5Cle+F%28ABC%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  C \le F(ABC), " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  C \le F(ABC), " /></p>
<p>is much better than the obvious one of 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++C+%5Cle+ABC.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  C \le ABC. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  C \le ABC. " /></p>
<p>For example, suppose that one wishes to know if 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++5%5E%7Bz%7D+%3D+2%5E%7Bx%7D+%2B+3%5E%7By%7D%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  5^{z} = 2^{x} + 3^{y}, " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  5^{z} = 2^{x} + 3^{y}, " /></p>
<p>is possible. The ABC conjecture shows that this cannot happen for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{z}" class="latex" title="{z}" /> large enough. Note 	</p>

<p>for positive integers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%2Cz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x,y,z}" class="latex" title="{x,y,z}" />.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Is He Correct? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Eight years ago Mochizuki announced his <a href="http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~motizuki/papers-english.html">proof</a>. Now it is about to be published in a journal. He is famous for work in part of number theory. He solved a major open problem there years ago. This gave him instant credibility and so his claim of solving the ABC conjecture was taken seriously. </p>
<p>
For example, one of his papers is <a href="https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/documenta/vol-kato/mochizuki.dm.pdf">The Absolute Anabelian Geometry of Canonical Curves</a>. The paper says: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> How much information about the isomorphism class of the variety <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> is contained in the knowledge of the étale fundamental group? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
A glance at this paper shows that it is for specialists only. But it does seem to be math of the type that we see all the time. And indeed the proof in his paper is long believed to be correct. This is in sharp contrast to his proof of the ABC conjecture. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Indicators of Correctness </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The question is: Are there ways to detect if a proof is (in)correct? Especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_long_mathematical_proofs">long</a> proofs? Are there ways that rise above just checking the proof line by line? By the way:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The length of unusually long proofs has increased with time. As a rough rule of thumb, 100 pages in 1900, or 200 pages in 1950, or 500 pages in 2000 is unusually long for a proof. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
There are some ways to gain confidence. Here are some in my opinion that are useful.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Is the proof understood by the experts? <p></p>
</li><li>
Has the proof been generalized? <p></p>
</li><li>
Have new proofs been found? <p></p>
</li><li>
Does the proof have a clear roadmap?
</li></ol>
<p>
The answer to the first question (1) seems to be no for the ABC proof. At least two world experts have raised concerns—see this <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/titans-of-mathematics-clash-over-epic-proof-of-abc-conjecture-20180920/">article</a> in <em>Quanta</em>—that appear serious.

Important problems eventually get other proofs. This can take some time. But there is almost always success in finding new and different proofs. Probably it is way too early for the ABC proof, but we can hope. Finally the roadmap issue: This means does the argument used have a nice logical flow. Proofs, even long proofs, often have a logic flow that is not too complex. A proof that says: Suppose there is a object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> with this property. Then it follows that there must be an object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> so that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /> Is more believable than one with a much more convoluted logical flow. </p>

Despite the interest in the complexity class MA, the randomized analog of NP, there is just a couple of known natural (promise-)MA-complete problems, the first due to Bravyi and Terhal (SIAM Journal of Computing 2009) and the second due to Bravyi (Quantum Information and Computation 2015). Surprisingly, both problems are stated using terminology from quantum computation. This fact makes it hard for classical complexity theorists to study these problems, and prevents possible progress, e.g., on the important question of derandomizing MA.

In this note we define a natural combinatorial problem called SetCSP and prove its MA-completeness. The problem generalizes the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) into constraints on sets of strings. This note is, in fact, a combination of previously known works: the brilliant work of Bravyi and Terhal, together with an observation made in our previous work (Aharonov and Grilo, FOCS 2019) that a restricted case of the Bravyi and Terhal's MA complete problem (namely, the uniform case) is already complete, and moreover, that this restricted case can be stated using a classical, combinatorial description. Here we flesh out this observation.

This note, along with a translation of the main result of Aharonov and Grilo to the SetCSP language, implies that finding a gap-amplification procedure for SetCSP problems (namely a generalization to SetCSPs of the gap-amplification used in Dinur's PCP proof) would imply MA=NP. This would provide a resolution of the major problem of derandomizing MA; in fact, the problem of finding gap-amplification for SetCSP is in fact equivalent to the MA=NP problem.</div>

<p>I hope all of you are keeping safe and healthy in these difficult times. Thank heavens we have our research and our math to keep our sanity…</p>



<p>This month has seen two papers, one on testing variable partitions and one on distributed isomorphism testing.</p>



<p><strong>Learning and Testing Variable Partitions</strong> by Andrej Bogdanov and Baoxiang Wang (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12990">arXiv</a>). Consider a function \(f:\Sigma^n \to G\), where \(G\) is Abelian group. Let \(V\) denote the set of variables. The function \(f\) is \(k\)-separable if there is a partition \(V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\) of $V$ such that \(f(V)\) can be expressed as the sum \(f_1(V_1) + f_2(V_2) + \ldots + f_k(V_k)\). This is an obviously natural property to study, though the specific application mentioned in the paper is high-dimensional reinforcement learning control. There are a number of learning results, but we’ll focus on the main testing result. The property of \(k\)-separability can be tested with \(O(kn^3/\varepsilon)\) queries, for \(\Sigma = \mathbb{Z}_q\) (and distance between functions is the usual Hamming distance). There is an analogous result (with different query complexity) for \(\Sigma = \mathbb{R}\). It is also shown that testing 2-separability requires \(\Omega(n)\) queries, even with 2-sided error. The paper, to its credit, also has empirical studies of the learning algorithm with applications to reinforcement learning.</p>



<p><strong>Distributed Testing of Graph Isomorphism in the CONGEST model </strong>by Reut Levi and Moti Medina (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00468.pdf">arXiv</a>). This result follows a recent line of research in distributed property testing algorithms. The main aim is to minimize the number of rounds of (synchronous) communication for a property testing problem. Let \(G_U\) denote the graph representing the distributive network. The aim is to test whether an input graph \(G_K\) is isomorphic to \(G_U\). The main property testing results are as follows. For the dense graph case, isomorphism can be property tested (with two-sided error) in \(O(D + (\varepsilon^{-1}\log n)^2) \) rounds, where \(D\) is the diameter of the graph and \(n\) is the number of nodes. (And, as a reader of this blog, you probably know what \(\varepsilon\) is already…). There is a standard \(\Omega(D)\) lower bound for distributed testing problems. For various classes of sparse graphs (like bounded-degree minor-free classes), constant time isomorphism (standard) property testers are known. This paper provides a simulation argument showing that standard/centralized \(q\)-query property testers can be implemented in the distributed model, in \(O(Dq)\) rounds (this holds for any property, not just isomorphism). Thus, these simulations imply \(O(D)\)-round property testers for isomorphism for bounded-degree minor-free classes.</p></div>

<p>I’m thinking of writing a novel where human civilization is threatened by a global pandemic, and is then almost singlehandedly rescued by one man … a man who reigned for decades as the world’s prototypical ruthless and arrogant tech billionaire, but who was then transformed by the love of his wife.  That is, <em>if</em> the billionaire can make it past government regulators as evil as they are stupid.  I need some advice: how can I make my storyline a bit subtler, so critics don’t laugh it off as some immature nerd fantasy?</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Updates (April 5):</span></strong> Thanks to several commenters for emphasizing that the wife needs to be a central character here: I agree!  The other thing is, I don’t want Fox News cheering my novel for its <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> vibe.  So maybe the pandemic is only surging out of control in the US because of the incompetence of a Republican president?  I don’t want to go ridiculously overboard, but like, maybe the president is some thuggish conman with the diction of a 5-year-old, who the deluded Republicans cheer anyway?  And maybe he’s also a Bible-thumping fundamentalist?  OK, that’s too much, so maybe the fundamentalist is like the <em>vice</em> president or something, and he gets put in charge of the pandemic response and then sets about muzzling the scientists?  As I said, I really need advice on making the messages subtler.</p></div>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: In Banach space theory, Rademacher type is an important invariant that controls many geometric and probabilistic properties of normed spaces. It is of considerable interest in various settings to understand to what extent such powerful tools extend to general metric spaces. A natural metric analogue of Rademacher type was proposed by Enflo in the 1960s-70s, and has found a number of interesting applications. Despite much work in the intervening years, however, the relationship between Rademacher type and Enflo type has remained unclear. This basic question is settled in joint work with Paata Ivanisvili and Sasha Volberg: in the setting of Banach spaces, Rademacher type and Enflo type coincide. The proof is based on a very simple but apparently novel insight on how to prove dimension-free inequalities on the Boolean cube. I will not assume any prior background in Banach space theory in the talk.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>Scott Aaronson blogged in <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4695">defense of “armchair epidemiology”</a>. Scott makes several points I agree with, but he also advocates that rather than discounting ideas from “contrarians” who have no special expertise in the matter, each one of us should evaluate the input of such people on its merits.</p>



<p>I disagree. I can judge on their merits the validity of a proposed P vs NP proof or a quantum algorithm for SAT, but I have seen time and again smart and educated non-experts misjudge such proposals. As much as I’d like to think otherwise, I would probably be fooled just as easily by a well-presented proposal in area X that “brushes under the rug” subtleties that experts in X would immediately notice.</p>



<p>This is not to say that non experts should stay completely out of the matter. Just like scientific journalists such as Erica Klarreich and Kevin Hartnett of quanta can do a great job of explaining computer science topics to lay audience, so can other well-read people serve as “signal boosters” and highlight works of experts in epidemiology. Journalist Helen Branswell of <a href="https://www.statnews.com/">stat news</a> has been following the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/business/media/stat-news-boston-coronavirus.html">novel coronavirus since January 4th</a>. </p>



<p>The difference is that these journalists don’t pretend to see what the experts are missing but rather to highlight and simplify the works that experts are already doing. This is unlike “contrarians” such as Robin Hanson that do their own analysis on a spreadsheet and come up with a “home brewed” policy proposal such as <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/02/consider-controlled-infection.html">deliberate infection</a> or <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/03/variolation-may-cut-covid19-deaths-3-30x.html">variolation</a> (with “hero hotels” in which people go to be deliberately infected). I am not saying that such proposals are necessarily wrong, but I am saying that I (or anyone else without the experience in this field) am not qualified to judge them. Even if they did “make sense” to me (they don’t) I would not feel any more confident in judging them than I would in reviewing a paper in astronomy. There is a reason why Wikipedia has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research">“no original research”</a> policy.</p>



<p>Moreover, the attitude of dismissing expertise can be dangerous, whether it comes in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teach_the_Controversy">“teach the debate”</a> in the context of evolution, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit_email_controversy">“ClimateGate”</a> in the context of climate change. Unlike the narrative of few brave “dissenters” or “contrarians”, in the case of COVID-19, experts as well as the world health organization have been literally sounding the alarm (see also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-timeline.html">timeline</a>, as well as this NPR story on the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/03/826945368/how-the-united-states-failed-to-see-the-coronavirus-crisis-coming">US response</a>). Yes, some institutions, and especially the U.S., failed in several aspects (most importantly in the early production of testing). But one of the most troubling aspects is the constant sense of  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-medical-advisers.html">“daylight”</a>  and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/26/trump-backers-coronavirus-conspiracy-117781">distrust</a> between the current U.S. administration and its own medical experts. Moreover, the opinions of people such as  <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-contrarian-coronavirus-theory-that-informed-the-trump-administration">law professor Richard Epstein</a> are listened to even when they are far out of their depth. It is one thing to entertain the opinion of non-expert contrarians when we have all the time in the world to debate, discuss and debunk. It’s quite another to do so in the context of a fast-moving health emergency.  COVID-19 is an emergency that has medical, social, economical, and technological aspects, but it would best be addressed if each person contributes according to their skill set and collaborates with people of complementary backgrounds.</p>

This post is devoted to the second interview with the <a href="https://concur2020.forsyte.at/test-of-time/index.html">colleagues</a> who were selected for the first edition of the CONCUR  Test-of-Time Award. (See <a href="https://processalgebra.blogspot.com/2020/04/an-interview-with-davide-sangiorgi.html">here</a> for the interview with Davide Sangiorgi.) I asked <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/lynch/">Nancy Lynch</a> (MIT, USA) and <a href="http://profs.sci.univr.it/~segala/">Roberto Segala</a> (University of Verona, Italy) a few questions via email and I copy their answers below. Let  me thank Nancy and Roberto for their answers. I trust that readers of this blog will find them interesting and inspiring.<br /><br />Luca:  You receive one of the two CONCUR ToT Awards for the period 1992-1995 for your paper "<a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Segala/CONCUR94.pdf">Probabilistic simulations for probabilistic processes</a>", presented at CONCUR 1994. Could you tell us briefly what spurred you to develop the “simple” probabilistic automaton model introduced in that paper and how the ideas underlying that notion came about?<br /><br />Roberto: We were studying randomized distributed algorithms and we noted that several algorithms suffered from subtle errors. We were looking for a formal, rigorous way to study the correctness of those algorithms and in particular we were trying to extend the hierarchical approach used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output_automaton">I/O automata</a>.  We knew that there was already an extensive literature within concurrency theory, but we were not able to use the theory to express even the simple idea that you may choose internally between flipping a fair or a biased coin; the existing approaches were extending labeled transition systems by adding probabilities to the arcs, losing the ability to distinguish between probabilistic and nondeterministic choice. The fact that the axioms for nondeterministic choice were not valid in most probabilistic calculi was further evidence of the problem. Starting from the observation that in the non-probabilistic world a step of a distributed algorithm corresponds to a transition of an I/O automaton, we tried to extend the notion of transition so that the process of flipping a coin could be represented by the "new" entity.  This led to the idea of "replacing points with measures" within ordinary automata and/or ordinary labeled transition systems. The idea worked very well for our analysis of randomized distributed algorithms, but we also wanted to validate it by checking whether it would simplify the concurrency-theoretical approach to probability. We decided to use simulation relations for our test, and indeed it worked and led to the CONCUR 1994 paper.<br /><br />Nancy: For background for this paper, we should recall that, at the time,  there was a divergence in styles of modeling for distributed systems, between different concurrency theory research communities.   The style I had been using since the late 70s for modeling distributed algorithms involved interactive state machines, such as I/O automata, which are based on a set-theoretic foundation.  Such models are good for describing distributed algorithms, and for analyzing them for both correctness and costs.  On the other hand, the predominant style in the European concurrency community was more syntactic, based on logical languages like PCTL or various process algebras.  These were good for formal verification, and for studying expressive power of different formalisms, but not great for analyzing complicated distributed algorithms.  Our models were in the general spirit of the Labeled Transition System (LTS) models previously studied in Europe.  When Roberto came to MIT, he and I set about to extend prior modeling work for distributed systems to the probabilistic setting.  To do this, we considered both the set-theoretic and logical approaches.  We   needed to bridge the gap between them, which led us to the ideas in this paper.<br /><br />Luca:  How much of your later work has built on your CONCUR 1994 paper? What follow-up results of yours are you most proud of and why?<br /><br />Roberto: Besides using the results of the paper for the analysis of several randomized distributed algorithms, we worked jointly as well as independently on the study of the theory and on the analysis of security protocols. In collaboration with <a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~fvaan/">Frits Vaandrager</a>, we were able to discover different ways to analyze security in a hierarchical and compositional way. Furthermore, since in simple probabilistic automata probability and nondeterminism are well separated, it was easy to include computational complexity into the analysis of security protocols. This is work I did in collaboration with Andrea Turrini. The clear separation between probability and nondeterminism turned out to extend our approach to real-time models, leading to notions like Probabilistic Timed Automata and to several of the elements behind the first sketches of the probabilistic model checker <a href="https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/">PRISM</a> in collaboration with the group of <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/marta.kwiatkowska/">Marta Kwiatkowska</a>.<br /><br />Nancy: Roberto and I continued working on probabilistic models, in the set-theoretic style, for several years.  As Roberto notes, Frits Vaandrager also became  a major collaborator.  Some of our more recent papers following this direction are:<br /><ul><li><a href="https://www.sws.cs.ru.nl/publications/papers/fvaan/CPA.html">Compositionality for Probabilistic Automata</a>, CONCUR 2003, </li><li><a href="https://www.sws.cs.ru.nl/publications/papers/fvaan/LSVsiam/">Observing Branching Structure through Probabilistic Contexts</a>, SIAM  Journal of Computing 2007, </li><li><a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Kirli/dilsun-icalp-tr.pdf">Task-Structured Probabilistic I/O Automata</a>, JCSS 2018.  </li></ul>This last  paper provides a kind of compositional foundation for combining  security protocols.  The key idea was to weaken the power of the adversary, making it more "oblivious".  In other related work, my students and I have worked extensively on  probabilistic distributed algorithms since then.  The models are similar to those developed in this early paper.  Examples include  wireless network algorithms, and more recently, biologically-inspired  algorithms, such as insect colony algorithms and neural network   algorithms.  I can't pinpoint a specific result that relies heavily on  the 1994 paper, but that paper certainly provided inspiration and foundation for the  later work.<br /><br />Luca:  Did you imagine at the time that the CONCUR 1994 paper and its journal version would have so much impact? In your opinion, what is the most interesting or unexpected use in the literature of the notions and techniques you developed in your award-winning paper?<br /><br />Roberto: We knew that the change of view proposed in the paper would have simplified the study and extension of several other concepts within concurrency theory, but we did not have any specific expectations. The collaboration on the PRISM project and on Probabilistic Timed Automata made more evident that there was a connection with Markov Decision Processes, which lead to a fruitful cross-fertilization between artificial intelligence, model checking, and concurrency theory.  It was a long exchange of ideas between a world interested in existential quantification, that is, find an optimal policy to achieve a goal, and universal quantification, that is to make sure that under any scheduler, policy, adversary, a system behaves correctly. The consequences of such exchange were many and unexpected.<br /><br />Nancy: No, I did not anticipate that it would have broad impact, though of course I thought the ideas were important.  But in general, I am  bad at predicting what will appeal to others and inspire them to further work.<br /><br />Luca:  The journal version of your paper appears in the Nordic Journal on Computing, which is not a prime venue. Did you ever regret not publishing that work somewhere else?  What is your take on the trend of using the perceived quality of a publication venue to evaluate research quality?<br /><br />Roberto: Within semantics I know of a few technical reports that are much more influential than most journal papers; I do not think that the venue of a paper should be given much importance. On the other hand, venue as an evaluation tool is more objective, allows an evaluator to consider many papers without reading them, and protects the evaluator from any type of claim against decisions, which sometimes may have even legal consequences.  Needless to say that I do not agree with any of the ideas above.  I do not agree as well with the other emerging trend of counting papers to evaluate quality. One good paper is much better than ten mediocre papers. What worries me the most is that young researchers may have a hard time to concentrate on quality if they have to focus on venue and quantity. I feel I was lucky not to have to worry about these issues when we submitted our paper for the special issue of the Nordic Journal of Computing.<br /><br />Nancy:   I certainly never regretted the venue for this paper.  In general, I haven't paid too much attention to choice of publication venue.  The main thing is to reach the audience you want to reach, which can be done through prestigious journals, less prestigious journals, conferences, or even ArXiv technical reports and some publicity.  It’s good to get feedback from referees, though. For evaluations, say for hiring or promotion, I think it’s fair to take many factors into account in evaluating research quality.  Venues, number of citations, special factors about different fields,… all can be discussed by hiring and promotion committees.  But I hope that those committees also take the time to actually read and consider the work itself.<br /><br />Luca:  The last thirty years have seen a huge amount of work on probabilistic models of computation and on the development of proof techniques and tools based on them. What advice would you give to a young researcher interested in working on probabilistic models in concurrency today?<br /><br />Roberto: My first advice would be to keep things simple and to focus on key ideas, possibly under the guidance of multiple application scenarios. When we study probabilistic concurrency, especially in contexts where the external world is governed by non-discrete laws, the interplay between different features of the model may become overwhelmingly complex. Of course it is a nice exercise to dive into all the details and see what it leads to, or to extend known results to the new scenarios, but how about checking whether some simple changes to one of the building blocks could make life easier?  Unfortunately, working on building blocks is risky. So, my second advice is to dive into details and write papers, but take some breaks and think whether there may be nicer ways to solve the same problems.<br /><br />Nancy: Pick some particular application domain, and make sure that the models  and techniques you develop work well for that application.  Don't work  on the theory in a vacuum.  The models will turn out much better!  Perhaps simpler, as Roberto says.<br /><br />Luca:  What are the research topics that currently excite you the most?<br /><br />Roberto: Difficult question. There are many things I like to look at, but at the moment I am very curious about how quantum computing can fit in a nice and elementary way into a concurrency framework.<br /><br />Nancy: Probabilistic algorithms, especially those that are flexible (work in  different environments), robust to failures and noise, and adaptive to  changes.  This includes such topics as wireless network algorithms,   robot swarms, and biologically-inspired algorithms.<br /><br /><b>Acknowledgements:</b> Many thanks to <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Ilaria.Castellani/">Ilaria Castellani</a>, who pointed out some typos in the original version of this text.</div>

<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I want to illustrate how computers can be great allies in designing (and verifying) convergence proofs for first-order optimization methods. This task can be daunting, and highly non-trivial, but nevertheless usually unavoidable when performing complexity analyses. A notable example is probably the convergence analysis of the stochastic average gradient (SAG) [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.2388.pdf">1</a>], whose original proof was computer assisted.</p>



<p class="justify-text">To this end, we will mostly spend time on what is referred to as <em>performance estimation problems</em> (PEPs), introduced by Yoel Drori and Marc Teboulle [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-013-0653-0">2</a>]. Performance estimation is also closely related to the topic of <em>integral quadratic constraints</em> (IQCs), introduced in the context of optimization by Laurent Lessard, Benjamin Recht and Andrew Packard [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/15M1009597">3</a>]. In terms of presentations, IQCs  leverages control theory, whereas PEPs might seem more natural in the optimization community. This blog post essentially presents PEPs from the point of view of [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>], instantiated on a running example.</p>



<h2>Overview, motivations</h2>



<p class="justify-text">First-order methods for continuous optimization belong to the large panel of algorithms that are usually approached via worst-case analyses. In this context, analyses rely on combining inequalities (that are due to assumptions on the problem classes), in potentially long, non-intuitive, and technical, proofs. For the insiders, those proofs all look very similar. For the outsiders, those proofs all look rather repelling, technical (long pages of chained inequalities), probably not interesting, and like computer codes: usually intuitive mostly for their authors.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In what follows, I want to show how (and why) those proofs are indeed all very similar. On the way, I want to emphasize how those combinations of inequalities are related to the “true essence” of worst-case analyses (which rely on computing worst-case scenarios), and to provide examples on how to constructively obtain them.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We take the stand of illustrating the PEP approach on a single iteration of gradient descent, as it essentially contains all necessary ingredients to understand the methodology in other contexts as well. Certain details of the following text are (probably unavoidably) a bit technical. However, going through the detailed computations is not essential, and the text should contain the necessary ingredients for understanding the essence of the methodology.</p>



<h2>Running example: gradient descent</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Let us consider a naive, but standard, example: unconstrained convex minimization $$x_\star= \underset{x\in\mathbb{R}^d}{\mathrm{arg min}} f(x)$$with gradient descent: \(x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma \nabla f(x_k)\). Let us assume \(f(\cdot)\) to be continuously differentiable, to have a \(L\)-Lipschitz gradient (a.k.a., \(L\)-smoothness), and to be \(\mu\)-strongly convex. Those functions satisfy, for all \(x,y\in\mathbb{R}^d\):<br />– strong convexity, see e.g., [<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-8853-9">5</a>, Definition 2.1.2]: $$\tag{1}f(x) \geqslant      f(y)+\langle{\nabla f(y)}; {x-y}\rangle+\tfrac{\mu}{2} \lVert x-y\rVert^2,$$- smoothness, see e.g., [<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-8853-9">5</a>, Theorem 2.1.5]: $$\tag{2} f(x) \leqslant      f(y)+\langle{\nabla f(y)}; {x-y}\rangle+\tfrac{L}{2}\lVert x-y\rVert^2.$$Let us recall that in the case of twice continuously differentiable functions, smoothness and strong convexity amount to requiring  that $$\mu I \preccurlyeq \nabla^2 f(x) \preccurlyeq L I,$$ for some \(0&lt; \mu&lt;L&lt; \infty\) and for all \(x\in\mathbb{R}^d\) (in other words, all eigenvalues of \(\nabla^2 f(x)\) are between \(\mu\) and \(L\)). In what follows, we denote by \(\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L}\) the class of \(L\)-smooth \(\mu\)-strongly convex functions (irrespective of the dimension \(d\)).</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="473" alt="" src="https://www.di.ens.fr/~ataylor/BlogPost/SmoothStronglyConvex.png" height="204" />Figure 1: the blue function is \(L\)-smooth and \(\mu\)-strongly convex (it is possible to create respectively global upper and lower quadratic bounds from every \(x\in\mathbb{R}^d\) with respectively curvatures \(L\) and \(\mu\)).</figure></div>
</div></div>



<p class="justify-text">In this context, convergence of gradient descent can be studied in many ways. Here, for the sake of the example, we will do it in terms of two base quantities: distance to optimality \(\lVert x_k-x_\star\rVert\), and function value accuracy \(f(x_k)-f(x_\star)\). There are, of course, infinitely many other possibilities, such as gradient norm \(\rVert \nabla f(x_k)\lVert\), Bregman divergence \(f(x_\star)-f(x_k)-\langle{\nabla f(x_k)};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle\), or even best function value observed throughout the iterations \(\min_{0\leq i\leq k} \{f(x_i)-f(x_\star)\}\): the reader can adapt the lines below for his/her favorite criterion. </p>



<p class="justify-text">For later reference, let us provide another inequality that is known to  hold for all \(x,y\in\mathbb{R}^d\) for any \(L\)-smooth \( \mu\)-strongly convex function: <br />– bound on inner product, see, e.g., [<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-8853-9">5</a>,  Theorem 2.1.11]: $$\langle{\nabla f(x)-\nabla f(y)};{x-y}\rangle  \geqslant        \tfrac{1}{L+\mu} \lVert{\nabla f(x)-\nabla f(y)}\rVert^2+\tfrac{\mu  L}{L+\mu}\lVert{x-y}\rVert^2.\tag{3}$$ In the case \(\mu=0\) this inequality is known as “cocoercivity”. This (perhaps mysterious) inequality happens to play an important role in convergence proofs.</p>



<h3>A standard convergence result</h3>



<p class="justify-text">Let us start by stating two known results along with their simple proofs (see, e.g.,  [<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-8853-9">5</a>, Theorem 2.1.14] or [6, Section 1.4.2, Theorems 2 &amp; 3]):<br />– convergence in distance:  $$\begin{array}{rl}    \rVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\lVert^2&amp;= \lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2+\gamma^2\lVert{\nabla f(x_k)}\rVert-2\gamma\langle{\nabla f(x_k)};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle \\ \     &amp; \leqslant      \left(1-\tfrac{2\gamma L \mu}{L+\mu}\right)\lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2+\gamma\left(\gamma-\tfrac2{L+\mu}\right)\lVert{\nabla f(x_k)}\rVert^2, \end{array} $$ where the second line follows from smoothness and strong convexity of \(f\) via the bound (3) on the inner product (with \(x=x_k\) and \(y=x_\star\)). For the particular choice \(\gamma=\tfrac2{L+\mu}\), the second term on the right hand side disappears, and we end up with<br />     $$\lVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\rVert^2 \leqslant      \left(\tfrac{L-\mu}{L+\mu}\right)^2\lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2,$$ which, following from \(0&lt;\mu&lt;L&lt;\infty\), satisfies \(0&lt; \tfrac{L-\mu}{L+\mu}&lt;1\), hence proving linear convergence of gradient descent in this setup, by recursively applying the previous inequality: $$ \lVert{x_{k}-x_\star}\rVert^2 \leqslant      \left(\tfrac{L-\mu}{L+\mu}\right)^{2k}\lVert{x_0-x_\star}\rVert^2.$$ – Convergence in function values: one can simply use the result in distance along with the previous basic inequalities (1) and (2) characterizing smoothness and strong convexity (both with \(y=x_\star\)):<br />     $$f(x_k)-f(x_\star) \leqslant \hspace{-.15cm}\tfrac{L}{2}\hspace{-.1cm}\rVert{x_k-x_\star}\lVert^2  \leqslant  \hspace{-.15cm}    \tfrac{L}{2}\hspace{-.1cm}\left(\tfrac{L-\mu}{L+\mu}\right)^{\hspace{-.1cm}2k} \rVert{x_0-x_\star}\lVert^2 \leqslant  \hspace{-.15cm}     \tfrac{L}{\mu}\hspace{-.1cm} \left(\tfrac{L-\mu}{L+\mu}\right)^{\hspace{-.1cm}2k}(f(x_0)-f(x_\star)).$$  It is also possible to directly look for convergence in terms of function values, but it is then usually unclear in the literature what inequalities to use, and I am not aware of any such proof leading to the same rate without the leading \(\tfrac{L}{\mu}\) (except the proof presented below).</p>



<p class="justify-text">At this point, even in this toy example, a few very legitimate questions can be raised:<br />– can we improve anything? Can gradient descent really behaves like that on this class of functions?<br />– How could we have guessed the inequality to use, and the shape of the corresponding proof? Obviously, the obscure fact is to arrive to inequality (1).  Therefore, is there a principled way for choosing the right inequalities to use, for example for studying convergence in terms of other quantities, such as  function values?<br />– Is this the unique way to arrive to the desired result? If yes, how likely are we to find such proofs for more complicated cases (algorithms and/or function class)?</p>



<p class="justify-text">For the specific step size choice \(\gamma=\tfrac2{L+\mu}\), a partial answer to the first question is obtained by the observation that the rate is actually achieved on the quadratic function<br /> $$f(x)=\tfrac12 \, x^\top \begin{bmatrix}<br /> L &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; \mu<br /> \end{bmatrix}x.$$ The following lines precisely target the missing answers.</p>



<h2>Worst-case analysis through worst-case scenarios</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Let us start by rephrasing our goal, and restrict ourselves to the study of a single iteration. We fix our target to finding the smallest possible value of \(\rho\) such that the inequality<br /> $$ \lVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\rVert^2  \leqslant       \rho^2 \lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2 $$ is valid for all \(x_k\) and \(x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma \nabla f(x_k)\) (hence \(\rho\) is a function of \(\gamma\)). In other words, our goal is to solve<br />$$ \rho^2(\gamma):= \sup \left\{ \frac{\lVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\rVert^2}{\lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2}\, \big|\, f\in\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L},\, x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma \nabla f(x_k),\, \nabla f(x_\star)=0\right\}.$$<br />Alternatively, we could be interested in studying convergence in other forms: for function values, we could target to solve the slightly modified problem:<br /> $$ \sup  \left\{ \frac{f(x_{k+1})-f(x_\star)}{f(x_{k})-f(x_\star)}\, \big|\, f\in\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L},\, x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma \nabla f(x_k),\, \nabla f(x_\star)=0 \right\}.$$ It turns out that in both cases, the problem can be solved both numerically to high precision, and analytically, and that the answer is \(\rho^2(\gamma)=\max\{(1-\mu\gamma)^2,(1-L\gamma)^2\}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The only thing we did, so far, was to explicitly reformulate the problem of finding the best (smallest) convergence rate as the problem of finding the worst-case scenario, nothing more. In what follows, some parts might become slightly technical, but the overall idea is only to reformulate this problem of finding the worst-case scenarios, for solving it.</p>



<h3>Dealing with an infinite-dimensional variable: the function \(f\)</h3>



<p class="justify-text">The first observation is that the problem of computing \(\rho\) is stated as an infinite-dimensional optimization problem: we are looking for the worst possible problem instance (a function \(f\) and an initial point \(x_k\)) within a predefined class of problems. The first step we take to work around this is to reformulate it in the following equivalent  form (note that we maximize also over the dimension \(d\)—we discuss later how to remove it):<br />$$\begin{array}{rl} \rho^2:= \underset{f,\, x_k,\,x_\star,\, g_k,\,d}{\sup} &amp;\displaystyle \frac{\lVert{x_{k}-\gamma g_k-x_\star}\rVert^2}{\lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2}\\<br /> \text{s.t. }    &amp; \exists f\in\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L}:\, g_k= \nabla f(x_k),\, 0=\nabla f(x_\star).<br />\end{array}$$<br />This problem intrinsically does not look better (it contains an  existence constraint), but it allows using mathematical tools which are referred to as  <em>interpolation,</em> or <em>extension</em>, theorems [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00241.pdf">7</a>, <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01530908/file/DHLL_appendix.pdf">8</a>]. The problem is depicted on Figure 2:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="490" alt="" src="https://www.di.ens.fr/~ataylor/BlogPost/Interpolation.png" height="209" />Figure 2: discrete interpolation (or extension) problem: given a set of triplets \(\{(\text{coordinate}, \text{gradient}, \text{function value})\}\) can we recover a function within a determined class that explains those triplets?</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out that convex interpolation (that is, neglecting smoothness and strong convexity) is actually rather simple:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>given a convex function and an index set \(I\), any set of samples \(\{(x_i,g_i,f_i)\}_{i\in I}\) of the form \(\{(\text{coordinate}, \text{(sub)gradient}, \text{function value})\}\)) satisfies, for all \(i,j\in I\): $$f_i \geqslant      f_j+\langle g_j; x_i-x_j\rangle,$$ by definition of subgradient, as illustrated on Figure 3.</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="485" alt="" src="https://www.di.ens.fr/~ataylor/BlogPost/SamplingCvx.png" height="205" />Figure 3: sampling from a convex function.</figure></div>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>In the other direction, given a set of triplets \(\{(x_i,g_i,f_i)\}_{i\in I}\) satisfying the previous inequality for all pairs \(i,j\in I\), one can simply recover a  convex function by the following construction: $$f(x)=\underset{i\in I}{\max}\{ f_i+\langle g_i;x-x_i\rangle\},$$ which is depicted on Figure 4.</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="487" alt="" src="https://www.di.ens.fr/~ataylor/BlogPost/InterpolateCvx.png" height="207" />Figure 4: some set \(\{(x_i,g_i,f_i)\}_{i\in I}\) and its piecewise affine interpolant \(f(x)=\underset{i\in I}{\max}\{ f_i+\langle g_i;x-x_i\rangle\}\).</figure></div>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>Formally, the reasoning allows arriving to the following “convex interpolation” (or “convex extension”) result, where we denote the set of (closed, proper) convex functions by \(\mathcal{F}_{0,\infty}\) (to be understood as \(L\)-smooth \(\mu\)-strongly convex functions with \(\mu=0\) and \(L=\infty\)): $$\begin{array}{c}\exists f\in\mathcal{F}_{0,\infty}: \,  g_k\in\partial f(x_k) \text{ and } f_k=f(x_k) \ \ \forall k\in  I\\ \Leftrightarrow\\ f_i \geqslant       f_j+\langle{g_j};{x_i-x_j}\rangle\quad \forall i,j\in I,\end{array}$$ where \(\partial f(x)\) denotes the subdifferential of \(f\) at \(x\).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">In the next section, we use a similar interpolation result for taking smoothness and strong convexity into account. The result is a bit more technical, but follows from similar constructions as those for convex interpolation—the main difference being that the interpolation is done on the Fenchel conjugate instead, in order to incorporate smoothness, see [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>, Section 2].</p>



<h3>Reformulation through convex interpolation</h3>



<p class="justify-text">Back to the problem of computing worst-case scenarios, we can now reformulate the existence constraint <em>exactly</em> using the following result (see [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>,  Theorem 4]): let \(I\) be a finite index set and let \( S=\{(x_i,g_i,f_i)\}_{i\in I}\) be a set of triplets, then<br />  $$\begin{array}{c}\exists f\in\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L}: \,  g_i=\nabla f(x_i) \text{ and } f_i=f(x_i) \text{ for all } i\in  I\\ \Leftrightarrow\\  f_i \geqslant      f_j+\langle{g_j};{x_i-x_j}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_i-g_j}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_i-x_j-\frac{{1}}{L}(g_i-g_j)}\rVert^2  \,\,\, \forall i,j\in I.\end{array}$$ Therefore, the previous problem can be reformulated as (recalling that \(g_\star=0\))<br />$$  \begin{array}{rl} \underset{{f_k,\,f_\star,\, x_k,\,x_\star,\, g_k,\,d}} {\sup}&amp;\displaystyle\frac{\rVert{x_{k}-\gamma  g_k-x_\star}\lVert^2}{\rVert{x_k-x_\star}\lVert^2}\\<br />      \text{s.t. }    &amp; f_\star \geqslant      f_k+\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2\\<br />      &amp; f_k \geqslant      f_\star+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2.<br />\end{array}$$ </p>



<h3>Quadratic reformulation</h3>



<p class="justify-text">The next step is to remove the ratio appearing in the objective function, which we do via an homogeneity argument, as follows.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Starting from a feasible point, scale \(x_k,\,x_\star,g_k\) by some \(\alpha&gt;0\) and \(f_k,\,f_\star\) by \(\alpha^2\) and observe it does not change the value of the objective, while still being a feasible point. Therefore, the problem can be reformulated as a nonconvex QCQP (quadratically constrained quadratic program): $$  \begin{array}{rl} \underset{{f_k,\,f_\star,\, x_k,\,x_\star,\, g_k,\,d}} {\sup}&amp;\displaystyle{\rVert{x_{k}-\gamma  g_k-x_\star}\lVert^2}\\<br />       \text{s.t. }    &amp; f_\star \geqslant      f_k+\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2\\<br />       &amp; f_k \geqslant      f_\star+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2\\ &amp;{\rVert{x_k-x_\star}\lVert^2} \leqslant      1,<br /> \end{array}$$  which is quadratic in \(x_k\), \(x_\star\) and  \(g_k\), and linear in \(f_\star\) and \(f_k\). Actually, in the current form, nonconvexity comes from the term “\(\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle\)” in the second constraint (and from the objective, due to maximization). It turns out that this problem can be reformulated <em>losslessly</em> using semidefinite programming (this is due to the maximization over \(d\), as commented at the end of the next section). </p>



<h3>Semidefinite reformulation</h3>



<p class="justify-text">At the end of this section, we will be able to compute, numerically, the values of the rate \(\rho^2(\gamma)\) for given values of the parameters \(\mu,\,L\), and \(\gamma\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The last step in the reformulation goes as follows: the previous problem can be reformulated as a semidefinite program, as it is linear in terms of the entries of the following Gram matrix<br />$$G = \begin{pmatrix}<br />     \lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2 &amp; \langle{g_k};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle \\ \langle{g_k};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle &amp; \lVert{g_k}\rVert^2<br />     \end{pmatrix}\succcurlyeq 0,$$ and in terms of the function values \(f_k\) and \(f_\star\). From those variables, one reformulate the previous problem as $$\begin{array}{rl} \underset{f_k,\,f_\star,\, G\succeq 0}{\sup} \, &amp;{\mathrm{Tr} (A_\text{num} G)}\\<br />      \text{s.t. }    &amp; f_k-f_\star+\mathrm{Tr} (A_1 G)\leqslant 0\\<br />      &amp;  f_\star-f_k+\mathrm{Tr} (A_2 G)\leqslant 0 \\<br />      &amp;\mathrm{Tr} (A_\text{denom} G) \leqslant      1,\end{array}$$ which is a gentle semidefinite program where we picked matrices \(A_{\text{num}}\), \(A_{\text{denom}}\), \(A_1\) and \(A_2\) for encoding the previous terms. That is, we choose those matrices such that<br /> $$\begin{array}{rl}<br />\mathrm{Tr}(A_{\text{denom}} G)&amp;=\lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2,\\  \mathrm{Tr}(A_{\text{num}} G)&amp;=\lVert{x_k-\gamma g_k-x_\star}\rVert^2,\\ \mathrm{Tr}(A_1G)&amp;=\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2,\\ \mathrm{Tr}(A_2G)&amp;=\tfrac{1}{2L}\lVert g_k\rVert^2+\tfrac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert x_k-x_\star-\tfrac1L g_k\rVert^2.\end{array}$$ One possibility is to choose \(A_{\text{num}}\), \(A_{\text{denom}}\), \(A_1\) and \(A_2\) as symmetric matrices, as follows: $$\begin{array}{cc}<br /> A_{\text{denom}}=\begin{pmatrix}     1 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0     \end{pmatrix}, &amp; A_{\text{num}}=\begin{pmatrix}     1 &amp; -\gamma\\ -\gamma &amp; \gamma^2     \end{pmatrix}, \\ A_1=\begin{pmatrix}\tfrac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)} &amp; -\tfrac12-\tfrac{\mu}{2(L-\mu)} \\ -\tfrac12-\tfrac{\mu}{2(L-\mu)} &amp; \tfrac{1}{2L}+\tfrac{\mu}{2L(L-\mu)}\end{pmatrix}, &amp;  A_2=\begin{pmatrix}\tfrac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)} &amp; -\tfrac{\mu}{2(L-\mu)} \\ -\tfrac{\mu}{2(L-\mu)} &amp; \tfrac{1}{2L}+\tfrac{\mu}{2L(L-\mu)} \end{pmatrix}.\end{array}$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">All those steps can be carried out in the exact same way for the problem of computing the convergence rate for function values, reaching a similar problem with \(6\) inequality constraints instead—because interpolation conditions have to be imposed on all pairs of points in a set of \(3\) points: \(x_k\), \(x_{k+1}\) and \(x_\star\), instead of only \(2\) for the distance problem. The objective function is then \(f_{k+1}-f_\star\), the de-homogenization constraint (arising from the denominator of the objective function) is \(f_{k}-f_\star \leqslant     1\), and the Gram matrix is \(3\times 3\):<br />$$G=\begin{pmatrix}<br />     \lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2 &amp; \langle{g_k};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle&amp; \langle{g_{k+1}};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle\\ \langle{g_k};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle &amp; \lVert{g_k}\rVert^2 &amp; \langle{g_k};{g_{k+1}}\rangle \\<br />     \langle{g_{k+1}};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle &amp; \langle{g_{k+1}};{g_k}\rangle &amp; \lVert{g_{k+1}}\rVert^2<br />     \end{pmatrix}\succcurlyeq 0, $$ and the function values variables are \(f_k\), \(f_{k+1}\) and \(f_\star\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We provide the numerical optimal values of those semidefinite programs on Figure 5 for both convergence in distances and in function values. </p>

<p class="justify-text">As a conclusion for this section, let us note that we showed how to compute the “best” rates that are dimension independent. In general, requiring the iterates and gradient (e.g., \(x_k\) and \(g_k\) for the problem in terms of distance, and \(x_k\), \(g_k\) and \(g_{k+1}\) for function values, and potentially more vectors when dealing with more complex settings) to lie in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) is equivalent to adding a rank constraint in the SDP. </p>



<h2>Duality between worst-case scenarios and combinations of inequalities</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Any feasible point to the previous SDP corresponds to a <em>lower bound</em>: a sampled version of a potentially difficult function for gradient descent. If we want to find <em>upper bounds</em> on the rate, a natural way to proceed is to go to the dual side of the previous SDPs, where any feasible point will naturally correspond to an upper bound on the convergence rate (by <em>weak duality</em>). As the primal problems were SDPs, their Lagrangian duals are SDPs as well. Let us associate one multiplier per constraint: $$ \begin{array}{rl}<br />f_k-f_\star+\mathrm{Tr} (A_1 G)\leqslant 0&amp;:\lambda_1\\<br />f_\star-f_k+\mathrm{Tr} (A_2 G)\leqslant 0&amp;:\lambda_2\\<br />\mathrm{Tr}(A_\text{denom} G) \leqslant 1&amp;: \tau.<br />\end{array}$$The dual is then<br />$$\begin{array}{rl}<br /> \underset{\tau,\,\lambda_1,\,\lambda_2}{\min} &amp; \, \tau \\<br /> \text{s.t. } &amp; \lambda_1=\lambda_2,\\<br /> &amp; S:=A_\text{num}-\tau A_\text{denom}-\lambda_1A_1-\lambda_2A_2 \preccurlyeq 0,\\<br /> &amp;\tau,\lambda_1,\lambda_2 \geqslant  0.<br /> \end{array}$$ Hence, by weak duality, any feasible point to this last SDP corresponds to an upper bound on the rate: \(\tau \geqslant \rho^2\). A mere rephrasing of weak duality can be obtained through the following reasoning: assume we received some feasible \(\tau,\lambda_1,\lambda_2\) (and hence \(\lambda_1=\lambda_2\) and a corresponding \(S\preccurlyeq 0\)), we then get, for any primal feasible \(G\succcurlyeq0\):<br />$$\begin{array}{rl}\mathrm{Tr}(SG)&amp;=\mathrm{Tr}(A_{\text{num}}G)-\tau\mathrm{Tr}(A_{\text{denom}}G)-\lambda_1\mathrm{Tr}(A_1G)-\lambda_2\mathrm{Tr}(A_2G)\\&amp;=\lVert x_{k+1}-x_\star\rVert^2-\tau\lVert x_{k}-x_\star\rVert^2\\ \,&amp;\,\,\,-\lambda_1[     f_k-f_\star+\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2]\\ &amp;\,\,\,-\lambda_2 [f_\star-f_k+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2]\\ &amp;\geqslant \lVert x_{k+1}-x_\star\rVert^2-\tau\lVert x_{k}-x_\star\rVert^2, \end{array}$$ where the first equality follows from the definition of \(S\), the second equality corresponds to the definitions of \(A_{\text{num}}\), \(A_{\text{denom}}\), \(A_1\) and \(A_2\), and the last inequality follows from the sign of the interpolation inequalities (constraints in the primal) for any primal feasible point. Hence, we indeed have that any feasible \(\tau\) corresponds to a valid upper bound on the convergence rate, as $$S\preccurlyeq 0 \,\,\Rightarrow \,\, \mathrm{Tr}(SG)\leqslant 0\,\,\Rightarrow  \lVert x_{k+1}-x_\star\rVert^2-\tau\lVert x_{k}-x_\star\rVert^2\leqslant 0.$$ In order to obtain analytical proofs, we therefore need to find analytical dual feasible points, and numerics can of course help in this process! Let’s look at what the optimal dual solutions look like for our two running examples.</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li> in Figure 6, we provide the numerical values for \(\lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_2\) for the distance problem.</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="467" alt="" src="https://www.di.ens.fr/~ataylor/BlogPost/Multipliers_distance.png" height="316" />Figure 6: numerical values of optimal dual variables: \(\lambda_1\) (red) and \(\lambda_2\) (dashed blue) as functions of the step size \(\gamma\), for the case where \(f\) is \(1\)-smooth and \(0.1\)-strongly convex.

<ul class="justify-text"><li>For function values, the SDP is slightly more complicated, as more inequalities are involved (6 interpolation inequalities). We provide raw numerical values for the six multipliers in Figure 7.</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="463" alt="" src="https://www.di.ens.fr/~ataylor/BlogPost/Multipliers_function.png" height="348" />Figure 7: numerical values of optimal dual variables (for the rate in function values): \(\lambda_1,\lambda_2, …,\lambda_6\) as functions of the step size \(\gamma\), for the case where \(f\) is \(1\)-smooth and \(0.1\)-strongly convex.

<p>For those who want a bit more details, here are a few additional pointers:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>Strong duality holds—a way to prove it is to show that there exists a Slater point in the primal, see e.g., [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>, Theorem 6]—, and hence primal and dual optimal values match.</li><li>There might be different ways to optimaly combine the interpolation inequalities for proving the desired results. In other words: dual optimal solutions are often not unique—which is, in fact, quite a good news: I am sure nobody want to find the analytical version of the multipliers provided in Figure 7.</li><li>It is often possible to simplify the proofs by using fewer, or weaker, inequalities. This might lead to ”cleaner” results, typically (but not always) at the cost of ”weaker” rates. This was done for designing the proof for function values, later in this text.</li></ul>



<h2>Combinations of inequalities: same proofs without SDPs</h2>



<p class="justify-text">So far, we showed that computing convergence rates can be done in a very principled way. To this end, one can solve semidefinite programs—which may have arbitrarily complicated analytical solutions. Here, I want to emphasize that the process of <em>verifying</em> a solution can be quite different to that of<em> finding</em> a solution. Put in other words, although the dual certificates (a.k.a., the proofs) might have been found by solving SDPs, they can be formulated in ways that do not require the reader to know anything about the PEP methodology, nor on any SDP material, for verifying them. This fact might actually not be very surprising to the reader, as many proofs arising in the first-order optimization literature actually “only consists” in linear combinations of (quadratic) inequalities. On the one hand, those proofs can be seen as feasible points to “dual SDPs”, although generally not explicitely proved as such. On the other hand, proofs arising from the SDPs might therefore be expected to be writable without any explicit reference to semidefinite programing and performance estimation problems.<br /></p>



<p class="justify-text">In what follows, we provide the proofs for gradient descent, using the previous numerical inspiration, but without explicitly relying on any semidefinite program. The reader is not expected to verify any of those computations, as our goal is rather to emphasize that the principles underlying both proofs are exactly the same: reformulating linear combinations of inequalities.</p>



<p class="justify-text">For both proofs below, we limit ourselves to the step size regime \(0\leq   \gamma \leq \tfrac{2}{L+\mu}\), and we prove  that, in  this regime, \(\rho(\gamma)=(1-\gamma\mu)\)—actually we only proof the upper bounds, but one can easily verify that they are <em>tight</em> on simple quadratic functions.  The complete proofs (for the proximal gradient method),  can be found in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.04398.pdf">11</a>]. </p>



<h3>Example 1: distance to optimality</h3>



<p class="justify-text">Recall the notations: \(g_k:=\nabla f(x_k)\), \(f_k:= f(x_k)\), \(g_\star:=\nabla f(x_\star)\), and \(f_\star:= f(x_\star)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">For distance to optimality, sum the following inequalities with their corresponding weights: $$\begin{array}{r}     f_\star \geqslant      f_k+\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k-g_\star}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}(g_k-g_\star)}\rVert^2  :\lambda_1,  \\     f_k \geqslant      f_\star+\langle{g_\star};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k-g_\star}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}(g_k-g_\star)}\rVert^2:\lambda_2.     \end{array}$$ We use the following values for the multipliers: \(\lambda_1=\lambda_2=2\gamma\rho(\gamma) \geqslant      0\) (see Figure 6). </p>



<p class="justify-text">After appropriate substitutions of \(g_\star\), \(x_{k+1}\), and \(\rho(\gamma)\), using respectively \(g_\star=0\), \(x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma g_k\) and \(\rho(\gamma)=(1-\gamma\mu)\), and with little effort, one can check that the previous weighted sum of inequalities can be written in the form: $$ \begin{array}{rl}    \lVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\rVert^2  \leqslant      &amp; \left(1-\gamma \mu \right)^2\lVert{x_{k}-x_\star}\rVert^2 -\frac{\gamma(2-\gamma (L+\mu))}{L-\mu} \lVert{\mu {(x_k  -x_\star)} – g_k}\rVert^2. \end{array}$$ This statement can be checked simply by expanding both expressions (i.e., the weighted sum and its reformulation) and verifying that all terms indeed match.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Finally, using $$\gamma(2-\gamma (L+\mu)) \geqslant      0,  \text{ and } L-\mu \geqslant      0,$$ which are nonnegative by assumptions on the values of \(L\in(0,\infty)\), \(\mu\in (0,L)\) and \(\gamma\in(0,2/(L+\mu))\), we arrive to the desired $$ \lVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\rVert^2 \leqslant      \left(1-\gamma \mu \right)^2\lVert{x_{k}-x_\star}\rVert^2.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that, by using \(\lambda_1=\lambda_2\), the weighted sum exactly corresponds to the (scaled by a positive constant) inequality introduced in the early stage of this note for studying distance to optimality. However, the resulting expression is tight for all values of the step size here, whereas it was only tight for \(\gamma=2/(L+\mu)\) earlier, due to a different choice of weights! </p>



<p class="justify-text">The curious reader might wonder how to find such a reformulation. Actually, back in terms of SDPs, and using the expressions for the multipliers, it simply corresponds to $$\mathrm{Tr}(SG)=-\frac{\gamma(2-\gamma (L+\mu))}{L-\mu} \lVert{\mu {(x_k  -x_\star)} – g_k}\rVert^2.$$ In the example below, the reformulation is a bit more tricky—as \(\mathrm{Tr}(SG)\)  has two nonnegative terms, which were simply obtained by doing an analytical Cholesky factorization of the term \(\mathrm{Tr}(SG)\)—, but the idea is exactly the same.</p>



<h3>Example 2: function values</h3>



<p class="justify-text">For function values, we combine the following inequalities after multiplication with their respective coefficients:    </p>



<p class="justify-text">$$\scriptsize \begin{array}{lr}     f_k \geqslant      f_{k+1}+\langle{g_{k+1}};{x_k-x_{k+1}}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k-g_{k+1}}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_{k+1}-\frac{1}{L}(g_k-g_{k+1})}\rVert^2    &amp;:\lambda_1,\\<br />f_\star \geqslant      f_k+\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k-g_\star}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{1}{L}(g_k-g_\star)}\rVert^2  &amp;:\lambda_2, \\<br />f_\star \geqslant      f_{k+1}+\langle{g_{k+1}};{x_\star-x_{k+1}}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_\star-g_{k+1}}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_\star-x_{k+1}-\frac{1}{L}(g_\star-g_{k+1})}\rVert^2  &amp;:\lambda_3.     \end{array}$$ We use the following multipliers \(\lambda_1=\rho(\gamma)\), \(\lambda_2=(1-\rho(\gamma))\rho(\gamma)\), and  \(\lambda_3=1-\rho(\gamma)\) (obtained by greedily trying to set different combinations of multipliers to \(0\) in the SDP—see Figure 7 for the values without such simplifications).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Again, after appropriate substitutions of \(g_\star\), \(x_{k+1}\), and \(\rho(\gamma)\), using respectively \(g_\star=0\), \(x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma g_k\) and \(\rho(\gamma)=(1-\gamma\mu)\), we obtain that the weighted sum of inequalities can be reformulated exactly as $$  \begin{array}{rl}          f(x_{k+1})-f_\star \leqslant      &amp;\left(1-\gamma \mu\right)^2 \left(f(x_k)-f_\star\right)\\&amp;-\frac{1}{2 (L-\mu)}\lVert \nabla f(x_{k+1})-(1-\gamma  (L+\mu))\nabla f(x_k) +\gamma  \mu  L (x_\star-x_k)\rVert^2\\<br />&amp;-\frac{\gamma  L(2- \gamma  (L+\mu))}{2 (L-\mu )}\lVert \nabla f(x_k)+\mu  (x_\star-x_k)\rVert^2.\end{array}$$ Again, this statement can be checked simply by expanding both expressions (i.e., the weighted sum and its reformulation), and verifying that all terms match. The desired conclusion $$ f(x_{k+1})-f_\star \leqslant \left(1-\gamma \mu\right)^2 \left(f(x_k)-f_\star\right), $$ follows from the signs of the leading coefficients: \(\gamma(2-\gamma (L+\mu)) \geqslant      0\), and \(L-\mu \geqslant      0\).</p>



<h3>To go further</h3>



<p class="justify-text">Before finishing, let us mention that we only dealt with linear convergence through a single iteration of gradient descent.</p>



<p class="justify-text">There are quite a few ways to handle both more iterations and sublinear convergence rates. Using SDPs, probably the most natural approach is to directly incorporate several iterations in the problem by  studying, for example, ratios of the form  $$\sup_{f\in\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L},\, x_0}  \frac{f(x_{N})-f_\star}{\lVert x_0-x_\star\rVert^2}. $$ This type of approach was used in the work of Drori and Teboulle [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.3209.pdf">2</a>] and in most consecutive PEP-related works: it has the advantage of providing  comfortable “non-improvable results” [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.07516.pdf">12</a>]   (by providing matching lower bounds) for any given \(N\), but requires solving larger and larger SDPs. Alternatively, simpler proofs can often be obtained through the use of  Lyapunov (or potential) functions—i.e., study a single iteration to produce recursable inequalities; a nice introduction is provided in [<a href="http://www.theoryofcomputing.org/articles/v015a004/v015a004.pdf">13</a>]. This idea can be exploited in PEPs [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00947.pdf">14</a>] by enforcing the proofs to have a certain structure. Those principles are also at the heart of the related approach using integral quadratic constraints [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/15M1009597">3</a>, <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/hu17a/hu17a.pdf">15</a>]. </p>



<h2>Take-home message and conclusions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The overall message of this note is that first-order methods can often be studied directly using the definition of their “worst-cases” (i.e., by trying to find worst-case scenarios), along with their dual counterparts (linear combinations of inequalities), by translating them into semidefinite programs.</p>



<p class="justify-text">What we saw might look like an overkill for studying gradient descent. However, as long as we deal with Euclidean spaces, the same approach actually works beyond this simple case. In particular, the same technique applies to first-order methods performing explicit, projected, proximal, conditional, and inexact (sub)gradient steps [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.07516.pdf">12</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Finally, let us mention a few previous works illustrating that the use of such computer-assisted proofs allowed obtaining results that are apparently too complicated for us to find bare-handed—even in apparently simple contexts.  Reasonable examples include the direct proof for convergence rates in  function values [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.04398.pdf">11</a>] presented above, but also proofs arising in the context of optimized numerical schemes [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.3209.pdf">2</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2636">16</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.5468.pdf">17</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06600.pdf">18</a>]—in particular [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06600.pdf">18</a>] presents a method for minimizing the gradient norm at the last iterate, in smooth convex minimization—,  in the context of monotone inclusions,  and even for more general fixed-point problems (e.g., for Halpern iterations [<a href="http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2017/11/6336.pdf">19</a>]).</p>



<h3>Toolbox</h3>



<p class="justify-text">The PErformance EStimation TOolbox (PESTO) [<a href="https://perso.uclouvain.be/julien.hendrickx/availablepublications/PESTO_CDC_2017.pdf">20</a>, see <a href="https://github.com/AdrienTaylor/Performance-Estimation-Toolbox/graphs/traffic">Github</a>] allows a quick access to the methodology without worrying about details of semidefinite reformulations. The toolbox contains many  examples (about 50) in different settings, and include progresses on the approach, and results, by other groups (which are much more thoroughly referenced in the <a href="https://github.com/AdrienTaylor/Performance-Estimation-Toolbox/blob/master/UserGuide.pdf">user guide</a>). In particular, we included standard classes of functions and operators, along with examples for analyzing recent optimized methods.</p>

<p>This post is devoted to a few memories of Boris Tsirelson who passed away at the end of January. I would like to mention that a few days ago graph theorist Robin Thomas passed away after long battle with ALS. I hope  to tell about Robin’s stunning mathematics in a future post.</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/tsirelson_boris.jpg"><img width="640" alt="" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/tsirelson_boris.jpg?w=640&amp;h=480" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19552" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Boris Tsirelson (1950 – 2020); <a href="http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~tsirel/">Boris’ home-page</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Tsirelson">Wikipedia</a>. (More links, below.)</p>
<p>The title of the post is taken from the title of a very interesting 1999 paper by Boris Tsirelson and Oded Schramm: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9902116">Trees, not cubes: hypercontractivity, cosiness, and noise stability</a></p>
<p>I was very sad and shocked to hear that Boris Tsirelson had passed away. Boris was one of the greatest Israeli mathematicians, and since 1997 or so we established mathematical connections surrounding several matters of common interest.  Here are a few memories.</p>
<h3>Love for coding</h3>
<p>1) One thing that Boris told me was that he loves to code. Being a “refusnik”, he could not get into Academia and (luckily) he could work as a programmer. And he told me that afterwards deciding what he liked more – programming or doing mathematical research – was no longer a trivial question for him.  Boris chose to go back to mathematical research, but he continued to enjoy programming, and when he needed it in his mathematical research, he could easily program.</p>
<h3>Love for quantum</h3>
<p>2) Another thing that Boris loved is “quantum”, the mathematics and physics of quantum mechanics and various connections to mathematics. Early on he proved his famous Tsirelson’s bound related to Bell’s inequalities, and later he was enthusiastic about the area of quantum computing. (And he learned it quickly, taught a course about it in 1997, and his 1997 lecture notes are still considered very useful.)</p>
<h3>Black Noise and noise sensitivity</h3>
<p>3) Perhaps the most significant mathematical connection between us was in the late 90s, and was centered around the theory of noise stability and noise sensitivity by Benjamini, Schramm and myself, which was closely related to a theory initiated by Boris Tsirelson and Anatoly Vershik. The translation between the different languages that we used and that Boris used was awkward, since the analog of Boolean functions that we studied was the “noise” that Boris studied, and the analog of noise sensitive Boolean functions in our language was “black noise” in Boris’s language. In any case, we had email discussions and we also met a few times with Itai and Oded regarding this connection.</p>
<h3>Black Noise and noise sensitivity II</h3>
<p>4)  Boris developed a very rich theory of black noise with relations to various areas of probability theory and operator algebras. He also found hypercontractivity that we used in our work quite useful to his applications, and also in this theory, he considered both classical and quantum aspects. I know only a little about Boris Tsirelson’s theory and its applications, but as far as tangent points with our Boolean interests are concerned, I can mention that Boris was enthusiastic by the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1101.5820">result</a> of Schramm and Stas Smirnov that percolation is a “black noise” and also that, in 1999, Boris and Oded Schramm wrote a paper whose title started with “Trees not cubes!”, presenting a different angle on this theory.</p>
<p>Tsirelson saw white noise (what we call noise stability) as manifesting “linearity” while “black noise” (what we call noise sensitivity) as manifesting “non-linearity”. Over the years, I often asked him to explain this to me.</p>
<h3>Tsireslon’s Banach spaces</h3>
<p>5) Geometry of Banach spaces is a very strong area in Israel so naturally I heard as a graduate student about “Tsirelson’s space” from 1974 and some subsequent developments in the 80s. Boris Tsirelson constructed a  Banach space that does not contain an imbedding of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell_p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\ell_p" class="latex" title="\ell_p" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="c_0" class="latex" title="c_0" />.</p>
<h3>Bible codes</h3>
<p>6) My first personal connection with Boris was related to claims regarding a hidden Bible Code, and a 1994 paper claiming a statistical proof of the existence of these Bible codes. For many years my attitude was that these claims should be ignored, but around 1997, I changed my mind and did some work to see what was going on. Now, Boris kept a site linked in his homepage devoted to developments regarding the Bible Code claims. In this site Boris kindly reported about my first 1997 paper on the topic, my observation that the proximity of two reported p-values for the two Bible code experiments was “too good to be true”, and my interpretation that this suggests that the claimed results manifest naïve statistical expectations rather than scientific reality.  A few weeks later, Boris reported about a much stronger evidence (by McKay and Bar Nathan) against the Bible Code claims (they demonstrated codes of similar quality in Tolstoy’s “War and Peace”) and subsequently after some time he lost interest in this topic.</p>
<h3>Quantum computing skepticism</h3>
<p>6) In 2005 we had some correspondence and meetings regarding my quantum computing skepticism. In his first email he told me that my reference to “decoherence” seemed strange and I realized that I consistently referred to “entanglement” as “decoherence” and to “decoherence” as “entanglement”.</p>
<p>7) In his 1997 lecture notes on quantum computing (that I cannot find on the web, so I count on my memory), Boris addressed the concerns of early quantum computers skeptics like Rolf Landauer. He did not accept the analogy between quantum computing and analog computation, but he also regarded the analogy with digital computation as problematic. Rather, he regarded quantum information based on qubits as something (at least a priori) different from both these examples. (Update: I found one non-broken link to the lecture notes; indeed the subtitle of Chapter 9 is “neither analog nor digital”.)</p>
<p>A joke that I heard from Boris at that time</p>
<p>8) I remember that once when I asked him about some aspects of quantum fault tolerance he told me the following joke: A student is entitled to a special exam, he arrives at the professor’s office, is given three questions to answer and he fails to do so. He request and is granted a make-up exam two weeks later. When the student shows up at the office two weeks later the professor, who forgot all about it, gave him the same three questions. “This is extremely unfair”, said the student “you ask me questions that you already know that I cannot answer.”</p>
<h3>Noise sensitivity and high energy physics</h3>
<p>9) In 2006 I came up with the idea that noise sensitivity might be a great idea for physics. Knowing very little physics, I wrote a little manifesto with this idea and tried it, among other people, on Boris. As it turned out, Boris had the idea that noise sensitivity could add a useful modeling power to physics (especially high energy physics) well before that time. (And by 2006 he was already a bit skeptical regarding his own idea.) He also told me that one of the motivations of his 1998 paper with Tolya Vershik came from some mathematical ideas related to physics of the big bang. When I asked him if this was written somewhere in the paper itself, he answered: “Of course, not!”</p>
<h3>Boris Tsirelson’s lecture at Oded’s memorial school</h3>
<p>10) in 2009 we organized a meeting in memory of Oded Schramm and Boris gave a lecture related to the Schramm-Smirnov “percolation is black noise” result with a single theorem. And what was remarkable about it that it was that he presented a classical theorem with a quantum proof. You can find the videotaped lecture here  (And here are the slides. Boris never wrote up this result.) Following this lecture we had a short correspondence with Scott A. and Greg K. about quantum proofs to classical theorems. (Namely theorems that do not mention quantum in the statement).</p>
<h3>Tsirelson’s problem</h3>
<p>11) Our last correspondence in 2019 was about Thomas Vidick’s  Notices AMS article about Tsirelson’s problem. (This was a couple of months before the announcement of the solution.) Boris was pleased to hear about these developments, as he was regarding earlier developments in this area. He humorously refers to the history of his problem on his homepage and this interview.</p>
<p>12) People who knew Boris regarded him as a genius from a very early age, and former students have fond memories of his classes.</p>

<h2>Some email correspondence</h2>
<h3>Oct. 2019 Vidick’s paper</h3>
<p>Dear Boris<br />
<a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201910/rnoti-p1618.pdf">This paper</a> by Thomas Vidick may interest you,<br />
best regards and shana tova Gil</p>
<p>Oh yes, sure!<br />
Thank you.<br />
Shana metuka, Boris</p>
<p>(Remark: “metuka” means “sweet” in Hebrew.)</p>
<h3>Dec 2006 (about noise sensitivity and physics)</h3>
<p>(Dec 2006) My very first idea in this field (inspired by conversations with Vershik) was<br />
rather physical (that Big Bang could be a natural occurrence of black noise),<br />
and in fact the main example of “Tsirelson and Vershik 1998” follows this line<br />
(not explicitly, of course).</p>
<p>In local (not Big Bang related) physics, I think, nonlinearity could produce<br />
such effect. And then the very idea of `the field operator at a point’ (on<br />
the level of operator-valued Schwartz distributions or something like that)<br />
will fail. However, physicists do not want to consider this possibility<br />
without very serious indications that it really is used by the nature. And<br />
they are right…</p>
<h3>2005 quantum computer skepticism</h3>
<p>Subject: Re: Noise and more</p>
<p>Dear Gil:<br />
Yes, of course, we can meet and speak.</p>
<p>For now, I am not much bothered. I am not an expert in quantum error<br />
correction, but anyway, my feeling is that all physically reasonable<br />
“attacks” of Nature are repelled. Especially, your three-qubit attack<br />
looks to me not dangerous. And, “der Herr Gott is raffiniert, aber<br />
boschaft ist er nicht”; Nature never attacks like an enemy.</p>
<p>Yours, Boris.</p>
<h3>Quick 2000 comments on a (sloppy) draft of my survey paper</h3>
<p>Dear Gil:</p>
<p>Thank you for the text; I am reading it.<br />
For now, only a trivial remark: “Tsilerson” should be “Tsirelson” in<br />
[133] and [134]; and in [132] “” should be “Tsirelson”…</p>
<p>Shabat shalom,<br />
Yours, Boris.</p>
<h3>November 1998: Noise sensitivity and black noise</h3>
<p>Dear Gil,</p>
<p>I am reading your (with Itai and Oded) paper. Thanks.</p>
<p>Moreover, I am thinking about changing the title of my future talk in<br />
Vien accordingly: from “The five noises” to “The six noises” (or even<br />
more).<br />
To this end, however, I need to answer the following question.</p>
<p>Is there a mesh refinement limit for the percolation?</p>
<p>That is, take the lattice with a small pitch \eps. Choose two<br />
“electrodes”, say, two vertical intervals on two parallel vertical<br />
lines, and ask about the probability that they are connected (via the<br />
bond percolation on the whole band between the two vertical lines).<br />
Let the electrodes be macroscopic; that is, they do not depend on<br />
\eps. Does the probability of the event have a limit for \eps \to 0 ?<br />
If it does, then one more question: what about the joint distribution<br />
for a finite collection of such events? That is, I want to see a weak<br />
limit of these “discrete” random processes. It seems to me, the<br />
question is well-known and was discussed. However, do you know the<br />
answer?</p>
<p>Yours, Boris.</p>
<p>Dear Itai, Oded, and Gil,</p>
<p>Thank you for the information. I see that for now we have a<br />
conditional result: if there exists “the noise of percolation”, then<br />
it is not a white noise.<br />
Yours, Boris.</p>
<p>Dear Gil:<br />
&gt; I dont understand yet the concept of “noise” precisely</p>
<p>One of ways is this. A noise is a scaling limit for coin tossing.<br />
You choose a class of “macroscopic observables” and look, whether<br />
their joint distribution converges, when n\to\infty. If it does, you<br />
get a noise. (For percolation we do not know, does it or not.)<br />
Now, if all “macroscopic observables” are noise insensitive, it means<br />
that the noise is white. For a white noise, there is only one<br />
invariant, its dimension (or multiplicity).<br />
If all “macroscopic observables” are noise sensitive, the noise is<br />
black. Probably, there are a lot of black noises, but for now we have<br />
only two examples, without knowing, whether they are isomorphic, or<br />
not. Spectra may be used for classifying black noises. Say, it may<br />
happen that for each “macroscopic observable”, its spectrum is<br />
concentrated on sets having Hausdorf dimension less than something.<br />
If some “macroscopic observables” are noise sensitive but some others<br />
are not (except for constants, of course), then the noise is neither<br />
white nor black. It may happen that it is a direct sum of a white<br />
noise and a black noise. However, it may happen that it is not. We<br />
have for now two such examples: “noise if splitting” and “noise of<br />
stickiness” (they are probably non-isomorphic); both are found by Jonathan<br />
Warren. I am trying to understand, whether your matter can give more<br />
examples.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>August 1998: Bible code story</h3>
<p>Dear Gil,</p>
<p>Thanks for the text.<br />
As for me, it is already an `overkill’, since for me the WRR94<br />
is basically dead. But maybe for others…</p>
<p>Yours, Boris.</p>

<div>Since March 19th I have worked out of home. I've had virtual meetings, sometimes seven or eight a day, on Zoom, Bluejeans, Google Hangouts, Google Meet, Blackboard Collaborate Ultra and Microsoft Teams. I take notes on my iPad using Penultimate which syncs with Evernote. I store my files in Dropbox and collaborate in Google Drive. I communicate by Google Chat, Gmail, Facebook messenger and a dozen other platforms. I continue to tweet and occasionally post in this blog. </div><div><br /></div><div>A billion of my closest friends around the world are also working out of home and using the same and similar tools. Yet outside of some pretty minor issues, all of these services continue to work and work well. Little of this would have been possible fifteen years ago. </div><div><br /></div><div>As Amazon scaled up their web operations to handle their growing business in the early 2000's they realized they could sell computing services. AWS, Amazon Web Services, started in 2006. Microsoft Azure, Google and others followed. These sites powered smartphones and their apps that push heavy processing to the cloud, small startups who don't need to run their own servers, and companies like Zoom when they need to scale up quickly and scale down like Expedia when they don't need as much use. Amazon and Microsoft makes most of their profit on cloud services. Amazon can't get me toilet paper but they can make sure Blackboard continues to work when all of our classes move online. </div><div><br /></div><div>Just for fun I like to occasionally look over the large collection of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/products">Amazon Cloud Products</a>. Transcribe an audio recording and translate to Portuguese, not a problem. </div><div><br /></div><div>The cloud can't allow all of us to work from home. We have many who still go to work including front-line health care workers putting their lives on the line. Many have lost their jobs. Then of course there are those sick with the virus, many of whom will never recover. We can't forget about the reason we stay indoors.</div><div><br /></div><div>But every now and then it's good to look back and see how a technology has changed our world in a very short time. If we had this virus in the 90's we'd still be having to go to work, or simply stop teaching and other activities all together.</div><div><br /></div><div>And how will our universities and other work spaces look like in the future now that we find we can work reasonably well from home and even better technologies develop? Only time will tell.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

The <a href="https://concur2020.forsyte.at/">International Conference on Concurrency Theory (CONCUR)</a> and the I<a href="https://concurrency-theory.org/organizations/ifip">FIP 1.8 Working Group on Concurrency Theory</a> are happy to announce the first edition of the CONCUR  Test-of-Time Award. The purpose of the award is to recognize important  achievements in Concurrency Theory that were published at the CONCUR  conference and have stood the test of time. All papers published in  CONCUR between 1990 and 1995 were eligible.<br /><br />The award winners for the  CONCUR ToT Awards 2020 may be found <a href="https://concur2020.forsyte.at/test-of-time/index.html">here</a>, together with the citations for the awars. They were selected by a jury composed of Jos Baeten, Patricia  Bouyer-Decitre, Holger Hermanns, Alexandra Silva and myself.<br /><br />This post is the first of a series in which I interview the recipients of the  CONCUR ToT Awards 2020. I asked <a href="http://www.cs.unibo.it/~sangio/">Davide Sangiorgi </a>(University of Bologna, Italy) a small number of questions via email and I report his answers below in a slightly edited form. Let  me thank Davide for his willingness to take part in an interview and for his inspiring answers, which I hope will be of interest to readers of this blog and will inspire young researchers to take up work on Concurrency Theory.<br /><br />In what follows, LA stands for Luca Aceto and DS for Davide Sangiorgi.<br /><br />LA: You receive one of the two CONCUR ToT Awards for the period 1992-1995 for your paper "<a href="http://www.lfcs.inf.ed.ac.uk/reports/93/ECS-LFCS-93-270/">A Theory of Bisimulation for the pi-Calculus</a>", presented at CONCUR 1993. Could you tell us briefly what spurred you to develop open bisimilarity and how the ideas underlying that notion came about?<br /><br />DS: I developed the paper on open bisimulation during 1992 and 1993.  I was in Robin Milner's group, in Edinburgh.  We were studying and questioning basic aspects of the theory of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A0-calculus">pi-calculus</a>. One such aspect was the definition of equality on processes; thus a very fundamental aspect, underlying the whole theory.  The equality had to be a form of bisimulation, in the same way as it was for CCS.  The two forms of bisimilarity that were around for the pi-calculus, late and early bisimilarity, are not congruence relations.  In both cases, the input clause of bisimilarity uses a universal quantification on the possible instantiations of the bound name. As  a consequence, neither bisimilarity is preserved by the input prefix (forbidding substitutions in the input clause would make things worse, as congruence  would fail for parallel composition). Therefore, one has to introduce separately the induced congruence, by universally quantifying the bisimilarities over all name substitutions.  In other words,  the two bisimilarities are  not fully substitutive ('equal' terms cannot be replaced, one for the other,  in an arbitrary context).   On the other hand, the  congruences induced by the bisimilarities  are not themselves  bisimilarities. Hence in this case 'equal' terms, after some actions,  need not be 'equal' anymore.  Thus, for instance, such relations do not support dynamic modifications of the context surrounding related terms.<br /><br />This situation was not fully satisfactory. The same could be said for the algebraic theory: there were proof systems for the two bisimilarities (of course, on finitary processes) but, because of the above congruence issue, there were no axiomatisations.  (In those years I was also working with Joachim Parrow on axiomatisations of these relations.)<br /><br />The universal quantification on substitutions in the input clause of the bisimilarites and in the definitions of the induced congruences was also unsatisfactory because it  could make checking equalities cumbersome.<br /><br />All these were  motivations for looking at possible variations of the definition of bisimulation. The specific hints towards open bisimulation came from thinking at two key facets of the pi-calculus model that were somehow neglected in the definitions of  early and late bisimilarities.  The first facet has to do with the pi-calculus rejection of the separation between channels and variables (`channel' here meaning a 'constant identifier'). In the pi-calculus ,there is only one syntactic category, that of <i>names</i>, with no formal distinction between channels and variables. This contributes to the elegance of the model and its theory. However, both in early and in late bisimilarity, the free names of processes are treated as channels, whereas the bound names of  inputs are treated as variables because of their immediate  instantiation  in the bisimilarity clause.   There was somehow a discrepancy between the syntax and the semantics. <br /><br />The second facet of the pi-calculus that contributed to the definition of open bisimilarity is the lack of the mismatch operator: the pi-calculus, at least in its original proposal, has a match operator to test equality between names, but not the dual mismatch, to test for inequality.  Mismatching had been excluded for the preservation of a monotonicity property on transitions, intuitively asserting that substitutions may only increase the action capabilities of a  process.  (Both facets above represented major differences between the pi-calculus and its closest ancestor----Engberg and Nielsen's Extended CCS.)  Thus I started playing with the idea of avoiding the name instantiation in the input clause and, instead, allowing, at any moment, for arbitrary instantiations (i.e., substitutions) of the names of the processes---the latter justified by the above monotonicity property of transitions. By adding the requirement of being a congruence, the definition of open bisimilarity came about.<br /><br />Still, I was not sure that such a bisimulation could be interesting and robust.  Two further developments helped here. One was the axiomatisation (over recursion-free terms).  It was a pure axiomatisation, it was  simple,  and with a completeness proof that leads to the construction of canonical and minimal (in some syntactic sense) representatives for the equivalence classes of the bisimilarity.  For other bisimilarities, or related congruences, obtaining canonical representatives seems hard; at best such representatives are parametrised upon a set of free names and even in these cases minimality is not guaranteed.<br /><br />The other development has to do with a symbolic or "efficient" characterisation of the bisimilarity. The initial definition of open bisimulation makes heavy use of substitutions.  In the symbolic characterisation, substitutions are performed only when needed (for instance, the unification of two names <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> is required if there is an input at <i>a</i> and an output at <i>b</i> that can interact), somehow echoing the call-by-need style of  functional languages.  Such a characterisation seemed promising for automated or semi-automated verification. <br /><br />LA: How much of your later work has built on your CONCUR 1993 paper? What results of yours are you most proud of and why?<br /><br />DS: The most basic idea in open bisimulation is to avoid the instantiation of the bound name of an input, possibly making such a bound name a free name of the derivative term.  The use of substitutions, elsewhere in the definition, is necessary to obtain a congruence relation for the pi-calculus.  I was surprised to discover, in the following years, that such substitutions are not necessary in two relevant subsets of the pi-calculus.  I called the variant of open bisimulation without substitutions <i>ground</i> bisimulation (I think the name came from Robin).  One subset is Honda and <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00076939/en">Boudol</a>'s Asynchronous pi-calculus, whose main constraint is to make outputs floating particles that do not trigger the activation of a continuation (other limitations concern sum and matching).  The other subset is the Internal (or Private) pi-calculus, in which only private (i.e., restricted) names may be transmitted.  I designed the Internal pi-calculus with ground bisimilarity in mind.  People seem to have found this calculus useful in many ways, partly because of its expressiveness combined with its  simple theory (in many aspects similar to that of CCS), partly because it allows one to limit or control aliasing between names, which can be useful for carrying out proofs about behavioural properties of processes, or for designing and reasoning about type systems, or for representing the calculus in logical systems.<br /><br />Sometimes, the possibility of using ground bisimulation can considerably simplify proofs of equalities of terms. For instance, in my works on comparisons between pi-calculus and lambda-calculus, when I had to translate the latter into the former I have always used one of the above subcalculi (sometimes even combining them, e.g., the Asynchronous Internal pi-calculus), precisely for being able to use ground bisimilarity.<br /><br />I  consider both ground bisimilarity and the Internal pi-calculus spin-offs of the work on open bisimilarity.<br /><br />While working on open bisimilarity for the pi-calculus, in a different paper, I applied the idea of open bisimilarity to the lambda-calculus.  I kept the name 'open'  but the bisimulation is really 'ground', as there are no substitutions involved.  I remember Robin encouraging me to keep the name 'open' because it conveyed well the idea of setting a bisimulation on open terms, rather than on closed terms as usually done. In  open bisimulation for the lambda-calculus, a lambda-abstraction<i> lambda x. M</i> yields an action with label <i>lambda x</i> that should be matched (modulo  alpha-conversion) by the same action by a bisimilar term. (Of course additional bisimulation clauses are needed when a free variable is found in evaluation position.) In contrast, in the ordinary bisimulation for the lambda-calculus,  Abramsky's applicative bisimilarity, the bound variable of an abstraction has to be instantiated with all closed terms, which is heavy. In general, open bisimilarity is finer than applicative bisimilarity and contextual equivalence (the reference equivalence in the lambda-calculus) but they often coincide in examples of concrete interest. Moreover, open bisimilarity does coincide with contextual equivalence in appropriate extensions of the lambda-calculus.  In short, open bisimilarity offers us a technique for reasoning on higher-order languages  using  'first-order' tools, somehow similarly to what game semantics does.<br /><br />This line of work about open bisimilarity in higher-order languages has been very fruitful, and is still studied a lot, for various forms of higher-order languages, sometimes under the name of 'normal-form' bisimulation. <br /><br />LA: In your opinion, what is the most interesting or unexpected use in the literature of the notions and techniques you developed in your award-winning paper?<br /><br />DS: I mentioned the hope, when working on open bisimilarity, that its symbolic "efficient" characterisation could be useful for automated or semi-automated tools for reasoning about behavioural properties.  Shortly after introducing open bisimulation,   Björn Victor and Faron Moller, both in Edinburgh at the time,   exploited it to design the Mobility Workbench. I also worked on an algorithm and a prototype tool for on-the-fly checking, with Marco Pistore.  <br /><br />However the most surprising applications in this direction have arrived later, when the 'lazy' instantiation of bound names of open bisimilarity has been applied to languages richer than pi-calculus.  For instance, Chaki, Rajamani, Rehof have used open similarity in their methods and tools for model checking distributed message-passing software.  Others have applied open bisimilarity to languages for security and cryptography, like the spi-calculus and applied pi-calculus. These include S. Brias, U. Nestmann and colleagues at EPFL and Berlin.   R. Horne, A. Tiu and colleagues in Singapore and Luxembourg have pushed significantly in this direction, with verification techniques and tools. For instance very recently they have discovered a privacy vulnerability for e-passports.  <br /><br />Similarly, Yuxin Deng and colleagues have applied the idea of open bisimulation to quantum processes, with analogous motivations --- avoiding the universal quantification in the  instantiation of variables, algorithmically unfeasible in the quantum setting as quantum states constitute a continuum.<br /><br />Another line of work that I found interesting and surprising concerns abstract frameworks for concurrency, including logical frameworks. Here forms of open bisimulation are often the 'natural' bisimulation that come up. These frameworks may be based, for instance on  coalgebras and category theory  (e.g., works by M. Fiore and S. Staton, N. Ghani,   K. Yemane, and B. Victor), category theory for reactive systems (e.g., works by F. Bonchi, B. König and U. Montanari), nominal SOS rule formats  (e.g., works by M. Cimini,  M. R. Mousavi, and  M. A. Reniers), higher-order logic languages (e.g., works by A.  Tiu, G. Nadathur, and D. Miller). <br /><br />There have been works that have pushed the idea of open bisimulation of avoiding the instantiation of  bound names in interactions with an external observer one step further: such bound names are not instantiated even in interactions<i> internal </i>to the processes. The substitutions produced by the interactions are added to the calculus, producing particles sometimes called fusions.  This mechanism resembles the explicit substitutions of the lambda-calculus, but it goes beyond that; for instance the addition of fusions leads to modifications of  input and output prefixes that produce pleasant syntactic and semantic symmetry properties.  Various people have worked on this, including B. Victor, J. Parrow, Y. Fu, C. Laneve, P. Gardner and L. Wischik.<br /><br />I should also mention the recent work by K. Y. Ahn, R. Horne, and A. Tiu  on logical interpretations of open bisimilarity. Remarkably, they explain the difference between the original (late and early)  formulations of bisimilarity in the pi-calculus  and open bisimilarity as the difference between  intuitionistic and classical versions of modal logics. <br /><br />Apologies for not mentioning everybody!<br /><br />LA: To your mind, how has the focus of CONCUR changed since its first edition in 1990?<br /><br />DS: I remember that in the early years of CONCUR there was  a tremendous excitement about the conference.  A forum for grouping the (fast-growing) community had been long-awaited.  In Edinburgh, every year after the conference,   the people with an interest in concurrency   would meet (multiple times!)  and discuss the contents of the proceedings.  Several of us every year would attend the conference. Attending the conference was very useful and interesting: one was sure to meet a lot of people, hear about excellent papers, have lively discussions.  We would  try to go,  even without  a paper in the proceedings.   I vividly remember the 1993 edition, where I presented the paper on open bisimulation.  It had been organised by Eike Best in Hildesheim, Germany. It was an  enjoyable and exciting week,  I met and knew a number of people of our community, and learned a lot. (How sad and unwise that the Computer Science department in Hildesheim, so strong in concurrency  at the time, was shut down a few years later.)  Over the years, the CONCUR community has kept increasing its size. The conference has substantially broadened its scope,  rightly including new emerging topics. Perhaps it is more difficult than in the past to (more or less) understand most of the presented papers, both because of the diversity of the topics and of their technical specialisation.  On the other hand, there are now satellite events, covering  a number of areas. Hence  there are always plenty of interesting presentations and talks to attend (this definitely occurred to me in the last edition, in Amsterdam!).  I should also mention here the activity on the IFIP WG 1.8 on Concurrency Theory, currently chaired by Ilaria Castellani, that in many ways  supports and promotes CONCUR.<br /><br />The quality of the papers at CONCUR is still very high. This is very important. As a community we should strive to maintain, and possibly even increase, the excellence and prestige of the conference, first of all, by submitting our best papers to the conference. CONCUR must be a reference conference in Computer Science, which is essential for injecting new people and energy into the community.<br /><br /><b>Acknowledgements:</b> Many thanks to <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Ilaria.Castellani/">Ilaria Castellani</a>, who pointed out a number of typos in the original version of this text.</div>
