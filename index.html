<p><b>Authors: </b>Shutao Tang <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.06330">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>Modern shape design and capture techniques often lead to the geometric data
presented in the form of serial rows of data points. In general, the number of
data points varies from row to row. Lofted or skinned B-spline surface
interpolation is a technique that generates a B-spline surface that passes
through these data points precisely. The traditional process often causes a
large increase in the number of control points of the resulting B-spline
surface. Much of the work to date in mitigating the effects of this increase
has been restricted to open section-curves. The lofting of sequential closed
contours using the interpolation technique has not been addressed in the
existing literature. In this paper, we present two novel conjectures relating
to closed B-spline curve interpolation. We derive the equivalent closed
B-spline interpolation condition of the well-established Schoenberg-Whitney
condition for open B-spline interpolation, a condition that the parameter
values and the domain knots should satisfy to guarantee the system matrix is
always invertible or full-rank. We then apply the interpolation condition to
the problem of lofted B-spline surface interpolation to serial closed contours.
The correctness of these conjectures is validated via numerical results and
several practical experiments. Github repository

current best approximation ratio is 4.675 for this problem with 1-fair
violation, which was proposed by Bercea et al. [APPROX-RANDOM'2019]. As far as
we know, there is no available approximation algorithm for the problem without
any fair violation. In this paper, we consider the fair $k$-median problem in
bounded doubling metrics and general metrics. We provide the first QPTAS for
fair $k$-median problem in doubling metrics. Based on the split-tree
decomposition of doubling metrics, we present a dynamic programming process to
find the candidate centers, and apply min-cost max-flow method to deal with the
assignment of clients. Especially, for overcoming the difficulties caused by
the fair constraints, we construct an auxiliary graph and use minimum weighted
perfect matching to get part of the cost. For the fair $k$-median problem in
general metrics, we present an approximation algorithm with ratio $O(\log k)$,
which is based on the embedding of given space into tree metrics, and the
dynamic programming method. Our two approximation algorithms for the fair
$k$-median problem are the first results for the corresponding problems without
any fair violation, respectively.

$[0,W]\times[0,\infty)$ and a set of $n$ axis-aligned rectangles of width at
most $W$. The goal is to find a non-overlapping packing of all rectangles into
the strip such that the height of the packing is minimized. A well-studied and
frequently used practical constraint is to allow only those packings that are
guillotine separable, i.e., every rectangle in the packing can be obtained by
recursively applying a sequence of edge-to-edge axis-parallel cuts (guillotine
cuts) that do not intersect any item of the solution. In this paper, we study
approximation algorithms for the Guillotine Strip Packing problem (GSP), i.e.,
the Strip Packing problem where we require additionally that the packing needs
to be guillotine separable. This problem generalizes the classical Bin Packing
problem and also makespan minimization on identical machines, and thus it is
already strongly NP-hard. Moreover, due to a reduction from the Partition
problem, it is NP-hard to obtain a polynomial-time
$(3/2-\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for GSP for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$
(exactly as Strip Packing). We provide a matching polynomial time
$(3/2+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for GSP. Furthermore, we present a
pseudo-polynomial time $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for GSP. This
is surprising as it is NP-hard to obtain a $(5/4-\varepsilon)$-approximation
algorithm for (general) Strip Packing in pseudo-polynomial time. Thus, our
results essentially settle the approximability of GSP for both the polynomial
and the pseudo-polynomial settings.

Collision-resistant hash functions (CRH) are a fundamental and ubiquitous cryptographic primitive. Several recent works have studied a relaxation of CRH called t-way multi-collision-resistant hash functions (t-MCRH). These are families of functions for which it is computationally hard to find a t-way collision, even though such collisions are abundant (and even (t-1)-way collisions may be easy to find). The case of t=2 corresponds to standard CRH, but it is natural to study t-MCRH for larger values of t.

Multi-collision-resistance seems to be a qualitatively weaker property than standard collision-resistance. In particular, Komargodski et al. (Eurocrypt, 2018) showed that there does not exist a blackbox transformation of MCRH into CRH. Nevertheless, in this work we show a non-blackbox transformation of any moderately shrinking t-MCRH, for t in {3,4}, into an (infinitely often secure) CRH. This transformation is non-constructive - we can prove the existence of a CRH but cannot explicitly point out a construction.

Our result partially extends to larger values of t. In particular, we show that for suitable values of t&gt;t', we can transform a t-MCRH into a t'-MCRH, at the cost of reducing the shrinkage of the resulting hash function family and settling for infinitely often security. This result utilizes the list-decodability properties of Reed-Solomon codes.</div>

In this paper, we prove a super-cubic lower bound on the size of a communication protocol for generalized Karchmer-Wigderson game for some explicit function $f: \{0,1\}^n\to \{0,1\}^{\log n}$. Lower bounds for original Karchmer-Wigderson games correspond to De Morgan formula lower bounds, thus the best known size lower bound is cubic. The generalized Karchmer-Wigderson games are very similar to the original ones, so we hope that our approach can provide an insight for proving better lower bounds on the original Karchmer-Wigderson games, and hence for proving new lower bounds on De Morgan formula size.

To achieve super-cubic lower bound we adapt several techniques used in formula complexity to communication protocols, prove communication complexity lower bound for a composition of several functions with a multiplexer relation, and use a technique from [TR20-117] to extract the "hardest" function from it. As a result, in this setting we are able to show that there is a relatively small set of functions such that at least one of them does not have a small protocol. The resulting lower bound of $\Omega(n^{3.156})$ is significantly better than the bound obtained from the counting argument.</div>

\mathbf{1}[\sigma(j)=i]\}_{j\in [n]}$. Our goal is to minimize the generalized
makespan $\phi(\mathsf{load}(\sigma))$, where
$\phi:\mathbb{R}^m\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$ is another symmetric monotone
norm and $\mathsf{load}(\sigma)$ is the $m$-dimensional machine load vector.
This problem significantly generalizes many classic optimization problems,
e.g., makespan minimization, set cover, minimum-norm load-balancing, etc.
</p>
<p>We obtain a polynomial time randomized algorithm that achieves an
approximation factor of $O(\log n)$, matching the lower bound of set cover up
to constant factor. We achieve this by rounding a novel configuration LP
relaxation with exponential number of variables. To approximately solve the
configuration LP, we design an approximate separation oracle for its dual
program. In particular, the separation oracle can be reduced to the norm
minimization with a linear constraint (NormLin) problem and we devise a
polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for it, which may be of independent
interest.

</p>
<p>Capacity and connectivity constraints have been studied in the literature
separately for all these problems. We give first constant factor approximations
when both the constraints are present. Extending/modifying the techniques used
for connected variants of the problem to include capacities or for capacitated
variants of problem to include connectivity is a tedious and challenging task.
In this paper, we combine the two constraints by reducing the problem to
underlying well studied problems, solving them as black box and combine the
obtained solutions. We also, combine the two constraints in the
prize-collection set up.
</p>
<p>In the prize-collecting set up, the problems are not even studied when one of
the constraint is present. We present constant factor approximation for them as
well.

Spirakis</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.05880">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>In this paper we study temporal design problems of undirected temporally
connected graphs. The basic setting of these optimization problems is as
follows: given an undirected graph $G$, what is the smallest number $|\lambda|$
of time-labels that we need to add to the edges of $G$ such that the resulting
temporal graph $(G,\lambda)$ is temporally connected? As we prove, this basic
problem, called MINIMUM LABELING, can be optimally solved in polynomial time,
thus resolving an open question. The situation becomes however more complicated
if we strengthen, or even if we relax a bit, the requirement of temporal
connectivity of $(G,\lambda)$. One way to strengthen the temporal connectivity
requirements is to upper-bound the allowed age (i.e., maximum label) of the
obtained temporal graph $(G,\lambda)$. On the other hand, we can relax temporal
connectivity by only requiring that there exists a temporal path between any
pair of ``important'' vertices which lie in a subset $R\subseteq V$, which we
call the terminals. This relaxed problem, called MINIMUM STEINER LABELING,
resembles the problem STEINER TREE in static (i.e., non-temporal) graphs;
however, as it turns out, STEINER TREE is not a special case of MINIMUM STEINER
LABELING. We prove that MINIMUM STEINER LABELING is NP-hard and in FPT with
respect to the number $|R|$ of terminals. Moreover, we prove that, adding the
age restriction makes the above problems strictly harder (unless P=NP or
W[1]=FPT). More specifically, we prove that the age-restricted version of
MINIMUM LABELING becomes NP-complete on undirected graphs, while the
age-restricted version of MINIMUM STEINER LABELING becomes W[1]-hard with
respect to the number $|R|$ of terminals.

<div class="content">
<p>If you zigzag back and forth through the columns (or rows) of an ordinary two-dimensional grid graph, following a pattern dignified with the fancy name “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boustrophedon">boustrophedon</a>”, you get a one-dimensional ordering of the vertices that can be used as the basis of a nice planar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_diagram">arc diagram</a> of this graph.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="80%" alt="Boustrophedon layout of a 2d grid" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/boustrophedon.svg" /></p>

<p>The same idea works in 3d. You can divide a 3d grid graph into 2d layers, zigzag within each layer, and then reverse the same zigzagging order in alternating layers, to get another nice one-dimensional ordering of the vertices. It doesn’t give a planar drawing (this graph is not planar), but it does allow it to be drawn without crossings on the four half-planes of a four-page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_embedding">book embedding</a>. More generally, any \(d\)-dimensional grid graph can be drawn in the same way as a book embedding with \(2(d-1)\) pages.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="80%" alt="Double boustrophedon layout of a 3d grid" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/double-boustrophedon.svg" /></p>

<p>I’m a coauthor on a new preprint showing that this one-dimensional layout is very sensitive to the way you connect nearby vertices in the 3d grid. If you modify the grid just a little bit, triangulating it by adding a diagonal to each grid square, then the resulting graph no longer has a book embedding with a constant number of pages. Instead, for a triangulated \(n\times n\times n\) grid, \(\Theta(n^{1/3})\) pages are necessary (and sufficient). The preprint is “Three-dimensional graph products with unbounded stack-number”, with Robert Hickingbotham, Laura Merker, Sergey Norin, Michał T. Seweryn, and David R. Wood, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05327">arXiv:2202.05327</a>; the long coauthor list is because it comes from a collaboration that began at the Banff workshop on Graph Product Structure Theory last November.</p>

<p>There are many other related results packed into the same preprint, but rather than summarizing them all I’d rather take a step back and look at the big picture. The result that triangulated grids have high book thickness turns out to follow from a sequence of connections that is closely analogous to results about the high width of 2d grids, and I think the analogies between these connections are very interesting. For 2d grids:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Two standard measures of one-dimensionality of graphs are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutwidth">cutwidth</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathwidth">pathwidth</a>. Both can be defined in terms of continuous maps from the graph (considered as a one-dimensional topological space) to a line. A graph has cutwidth at most \(c\) if it has a map in which every point of the line belongs to the images of at most \(c\) edges, and pathwidth at most \(p\) if it has a map in which every point of the line belongs to the images of edges that have at most \(p\) distinct vertices as their left endpoints.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a graph of maximum degree \(d\), at most \(d\) edges can share a left endpoint, so if the graph has cutwidth \(c\) it has pathwidth at least \(c/d\).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A complete graph with \(n\) vertices and \(\tbinom{n}{2}\) edges, mapped continuously to a line, always has a point covered by \(\Omega(n^2)\) edges, at the median vertex of the mapping.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a 2d grid graph, we can associate each vertex with a subgraph consisting of the union of the row and column of the grid containing that vertex.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><img width="50%" alt="Bramble associating each grid vertex with the union of its row and column" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/grid-bramble.svg" /></p>

    <p>This family of subgraphs is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bramble_(graph_theory)">bramble</a>, meaning that all of the subgraphs are connected and touch each other. In this case, they all touch at shared vertices, but brambles also allow subgraphs to touch across edges. In the bramble for an \(n\times n\) grid graph, each graph vertex or edge belongs to \(O(n)\) subgraphs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can map \(K_{n^2}\) continuously onto the grid, vertex-to-vertex, by mapping each edge of \(K_{n^2}\) onto a path through the two touching subgraphs for its endpoints. This map has low congestion: each grid vertex or edge is in the image of \(O(n)\) vertices or edges of \(K_{n^2}\).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any map of the grid to a line can be composed with the map from \(K_{n^2}\) to the grid, giving a map of \(K_{n^2}\) onto the line. Because of the low congestion of the map to the grid, a point of the line that is covered by \(\Omega(n^2)\) edges of the complete graph must also be covered by \(\Omega(n)\) edges of the grid. Since this is true for all maps to a line, the grid has pathwidth and cutwidth \(\Omega(n)\).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now let’s do the same thing, stepped up a dimension!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of graphs, let’s consider 2-dimensional simplicial complexes, systems of points, edges, and triangles. And instead of mapping them to a one-dimensional line, let’s map them (topologically, not necessarily linearly) to a two-dimensional plane. We’ll say that the mapping has high thickness if some point is covered by many triangles (corresponding to cutwidth), or by many vertex-disjoint triangles (corresponding to pathwidth).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For a graph of maximum  degree \(d\), at most \(\tbinom{d}{2}\) triangles can share a vertex, so a point covered by many triangles will be covered by many vertex-disjoint triangles. More importantly, this is where the book thickness comes in: an argument related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Szekeres_theorem">Erdős–Szekeres theorem</a> proves that, when a graph has a \(\theta\)-page book embedding, drawn with its vertices on a circle and its edges as chords of the circle, then at most \(\theta^3\) vertex-disjoint triangles in the graph can contain any point within the circle. So if every mapping into the plane produces a system of triangles of thickness \(t\), you also get book thickness \(\Omega(t^{1/3})\).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A complete simplicial complex with \(n\) vertices, \(\tbinom{n}{2}\) edges, and \(\tbinom{n}{3}\) triangles, mapped to the plane, always leads to a point covered by \(\Omega(n^3)\) triangles, by a result of Gromov. (This is closely related to the earlier work of Regina Liu on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_depth">simplicial depth</a> but we want to allow any continuous mapping to the plane, whereas simplicial depth involves mappings that are linear on each edge and triangle.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For an \(n\times n\times n\) grid graph, with its squares triangulated to form a 2d complex \(C\), we can associate each vertex with a subcomplex of \(C\) consisting of the union of the 2d grid planes containing that vertex. This family of subcomplexes has connected pairwise unions and simply connected triplewise unions, analogous to the properties of a bramble for a graph.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can map the complete simplicial complex onto the grid, vertex-to-vertex, by mapping each edge onto a path through the union of two subgraphs and each triangle onto a triangulated surface within the union of three subgraphs. This map has low congestion: each grid vertex, edge, or triangle is in the image of \(O(n^2)\) vertices, edges, or triangles of the complete complex.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any map of the triangulated 3d grid onto the plane can be composed with the map from the complete 2-complex to the grid, giving a map of the complete complex onto the plane. Because of the low congestion of the map to the grid, a point of the plane that is covered by \(\Omega(n^3)\) triangles of the complete complex must also be covered by \(\Omega(n)\) triangles of the triangulated grid. Since this is true for all maps to a plane, the triangulated grid has book thickness \(\Omega(n^{1/3})\).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For details, generalizations to triangulated products of trees and non-grid tessellations of space, matching upper bounds on book thickness, and more, please see the preprint.</p>

KC’s Patrick Mahomes, however, demonstrated the <a href="https://dailystatuss.com/13-seconds-meme-13-seconds-chief-nfl-2022/">13-second drill</a> in two plays plus a tying field goal. That is, the Bills were good for 3 quarters plus 14:47. But Mahomes is not in the Super Bowl either. Two weeks ago, he lost the magic touch in both the closing minute of the fourth quarter and the beginning of overtime as KC squandered a big lead and lost to the Cincinnati Bengals. Whose quarterback, Joe Burrow, <i>is</i> playing in today’s Super Bowl, opposite Matthew Stafford of the Los Angeles Rams.</p>
<p>
The American football field is divided into 100 yards, but rarely subdivided beyond that. The announcers may refer to “a long two yards” or “a short 3,” but never 2.5 yards. It is not just the announcers. Official statistics are kept in units of whole yards, more often rounded up than down. A fourth-down quarterback plunge with 3 inches to go still counts as a 1-yard gain. Perhaps it is essential to the yard that it not be divided into dyadic or decimal units, the way the meter is. As the US celebrates an event still enjoyed by “one nation indivisible,” we note the indivisible.</p>

Godfrey Hardy, John Littlewood, George Polya are famous for many things separately and together. All three lent their names to the timeless book <a href="https://mathematicalolympiads.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/inequalities-hardy-littlewood-polya.pdf">Inequalities</a>. It codifies the theory of real inequalities. </p>

<p>
</p><p></p><h2> An Inequality </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We recently had reason to look at the following inequality: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%5E2+-+b%5E2+%3D+c%3E0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{a^2 - b^2 = c&gt;0}" class="latex" />, then 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++c+%5Cge+a%2Bb.+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  c \ge a+b. " class="latex" /></p>
</em><p><em></em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>We noted that this fails in general: Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%3D1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{a=1/2}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%3D1%2F4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{b=1/4}" class="latex" />. Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%3D3%2F16%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c=3/16}" class="latex" /> and 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++3%2F16+%3C+1%2F2+%2B+1%2F4.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  3/16 &lt; 1/2 + 1/4. " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This is not even close. But wait—the following lemma is true:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Lemma 1</b> <em> If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%5E2+-+b%5E2+%3D+c%3E0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{a^2 - b^2 = c&gt;0}" class="latex" />, then 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++c+%5Cge+a%2Bb+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  c \ge a+b " class="latex" /></p>
</em><p><em>provided <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%2Cb%2Cc%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{a,b,c}" class="latex" /> are integers. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The proof is quite simple. We note that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++c+%3D+%28a-b%29%28a%2Bb%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  c = (a-b)(a+b). " class="latex" /></p>
<p>But this shows that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%2Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{a+b}" class="latex" /> is a non-zero divisor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" />. But then 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++a%2Bb+%5Cle+c.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  a+b \le c. " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This proves the inequality. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Is this interesting at all? We have an application of the above lemma, which we will discuss in the future. Are there other good examples of inequalities that are general and natural and only hold over the integers? Or is seeking them like trying to “outsmart math itself”?</p>

<p>When, before covid, I used to travel the world giving quantum computing talks, every once in a while I’d meet an older person who asked whether I had any relation to a 1970s science writer by the name of Steve Aaronson.  So, yeah, Steve Aaronson is my dad.  He majored in English in Penn State, where he was lucky enough to study under the legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tenn">Phil Klass</a>, who wrote under the pen name William Tenn and who basically created the genre of science-fiction comedy, half a century before there were any such things as <em>Futurama</em>.  After graduating, my dad became a popular physics and cosmology writer, who interviewed greats like Steven Weinberg and John Archibald Wheeler and Arno Penzias (discoverer of the cosmic microwave background radiation).  He published not only in science magazines but in <em>Playboy</em> and <em>Penthouse</em>, which (as he explained to my mom) paid better than the science magazines.  When I was growing up, my dad had a <em>Playboy</em> on his office shelf, which I might take down if for example I wanted to show a friend a 2-page article, with an Aaronson byline, about the latest thinking on the preponderance of matter over antimatter in the visible universe.</p>



<p>Eventually, partly motivated by the need to make money to support … well, me, and then my brother, my dad left freelancing to become a corporate science writer at AT&amp;T Bell Labs.  There, my dad wrote speeches, delivered on the floor of Congress, about how breaking up AT&amp;T’s monopoly would devastate Bell Labs, a place that stood with ancient Alexandria and Cambridge University among the human species’ most irreplaceable engines of scientific creativity.  (Being a good writer, my dad didn’t put it in <em>quite</em> those words.)  Eventually, of course, AT&amp;T <em>was</em> broken up, and my dad’s dire warning about Bell Labs turned out to be 100% vindicated … although on the positive side, Americans got much cheaper long distance.</p>



<p>After a decade at Bell Labs, my dad was promoted to be a public relations executive at AT&amp;T itself, where when I was a teenager, he was centrally involved in the launch of the AT&amp;T spinoff <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucent">Lucent Technologies</a> (motto: “Bell Labs Innovations”), and then later the Lucent spinoff <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avaya">Avaya</a>—developments that AT&amp;T’s original breakup had caused as downstream effects.</p>



<p>In the 1970s, somewhere between his magazine stage and his Bell Labs stage, my dad also worked for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Garfield">Eugene Garfield</a>, the pioneer of bibliometrics for scientific papers and founder of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Scientific_Information">Institute for Scientific Information</a>, or ISI.  (Sergey Brin and Larry Page would later cite Garfield’s work, on the statistics of the scientific-citation graph, as one of the precedents for the PageRank algorithm at the core of Google.)</p>



<p>My dad’s job at ISI was to supply Eugene Garfield with “raw material” for essays, which the latter would then write and publish in ISI’s journal <em>Current Contents</em> under the byline Eugene Garfield.  Once, though, my dad supplied some “raw material” for a planned essay about “Style in Scientific Writing”—and, well, I’ll let Garfield <a href="http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v3p004y1977-78.pdf">tell</a> the rest:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This topic of style in scientific writing was first proposed as something I should undertake myself, with some research and drafting help from Steve.  I couldn’t, with a clear conscience, have put my name to the “draft” he submitted.  And, though I don’t disagree with much of it, I didn’t want to modify or edit it in order to justify claiming it as my own.  So here is Aaronson’s “draft,” as it was submitted for “review.”  You can say I got a week’s vacation.  After reading what he wrote it required little work to write this introduction.</p></blockquote>



<p>Interested yet?  You can <a href="http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v3p004y1977-78.pdf">read “Style in Scientific Writing” here</a>.  You can, if we’re being honest, tell that this piece was originally intended as “raw material”—but only because of the way it calls forth such a fierce armada of all of history’s awesomest quotations about what makes scientific writing good or bad, like Ben Franklin and William James and the whole gang, which would make it worth the read regardless.  I <em>love</em> eating raw dough, I confess, and I love my dad’s essay.  (My dad, ironically enough, likes everything he eats to be thoroughly cooked.)</p>



<p>When I read that essay, I hear my dad’s voice from my childhood.  “Omit needless words.”  There were countless revisions and pieces of advice on every single thing I wrote, but usually, “omit needless words” was the core of it.  And as terrible as you all know me to be on that count, imagine <em>how much worse</em> it would’ve been if not for my dad!  And I know that as soon as he reads this post, he’ll find needless words to omit.</p>



<p>But hopefully he won’t omit these:</p>



<p>Happy 70th birthday Pops, congrats on beating the cancer, and here’s to many more!</p></div>

We use results from communication complexity, both new and old ones, to prove lower bounds for unambiguous finite automata (UFAs). We show three results.

$\textbf{Complement:}$ There is a language $L$ recognised by an $n$-state UFA such that the complement language $\overline{L}$ requires NFAs with $n^{\tilde{\Omega}(\log n)}$ states. This improves on a lower bound by Raskin.

$\textbf{Union:}$ There are languages $L_1$, $L_2$ recognised by $n$-state UFAs such that the union $L_1\cup L_2$ requires UFAs with $n^{\tilde{\Omega}(\log n)}$ states.

$\textbf{Separation:}$ There is a language $L$ such that both $L$ and $\overline{L}$ are recognised by $n$-state NFAs but such that $L$ requires UFAs with $n^{\Omega(\log n)}$ states. This refutes a conjecture by Colcombet.</div>

Taher Elgamal and Anna Karlin are among 111 <a href="https://www.nae.edu/270224/National-Academy-of-Engineering-Elects-111-Members-and-22-International-Members">new US members</a> of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE). That’s one-hundred-and-eleven, not seven in binary.</p>
<p>
Today we congratulate them and all the new members.<br />
<span id="more-19636"></span></p>
<p>
Elgamal and Karlin are the two closest to theory, by my reckoning. Elgamal developed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_encryption">ElGamal</a> encryption scheme. Elgamal spelled his name with a capital G at the time of his famous 1985 <a href="https://caislab.kaist.ac.kr/lecture/2010/spring/cs548/basic/B02.pdf">paper</a> but it is lowercased on his own LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taherelgamal/">page</a>, on Wikipedia, on his RSA conference <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/experts/dr-taherelgamal">page</a>, and by the NAE. Wikipedia explains that he spells it more simply so that “it is less likely to be mangled in English.” Yet his invention keeps the capital G. Ken and I think a good reason for this is that it uses a large cyclic group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" />. The citation also hails his work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#SSL_1.0,_2.0,_and_3.0">SSL</a> and other internet protocols.</p>
<p>
We featured Karlin’s nifty joint paper on the metric TSP problem recently <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2020/10/26/a-vast-and-tiny-breakthrough/">here</a>. She is also on the editorial board of the new TheoretiCS <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/12/01/the-new-journal/">journal</a>. I was glad to serve with her on an NSF committee to promote <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/07/12/time-chunks-and-theory-nuggets/">nuggets</a> of theory. She holds the Bill and Melinda Gates Chair at the Paul Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington.</p>
<p>
The new members bring the total US membership in the NAE to 2,388. Joining them are 22 new international members. They include Natarajan Chandrasekaran of Tata Sons for advancing the Indian software industry and Hongjiang Zhang of The Carlyle Group in Beijing for multimedia computing. </p>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Many natural classes of undirected graphs are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_property">hereditary</a>, meaning that if you delete vertices from any graph in the class, the induced subgraph that you get always remains in this class. Every hereditary class of graphs can be defined by its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_graph_characterization">forbidden induced subgraphs</a>, the minimal graphs that do not belong to the class. When there are only finitely many of these forbidden subgraphs, it is possible to define the class by a formula in the first-order <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_of_graphs">logic of graphs</a> describing the graphs that do not have these subgraphs, and to test membership in the class in polynomial time by searching for a forbidden subgraph. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_graph">threshold graphs</a>, whose forbidden subgraphs are a four-vertex path, four-vertex cycle, or four-vertex perfect matching.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cograph">cographs</a>, whose single forbidden subgraph is a four-vertex path.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle-free_graph">triangle-free graphs</a>, whose single forbidden subgraph is a <span style="white-space: nowrap;">triangle \(K_3\).</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claw-free_graph">claw-free graphs</a>, whose single forbidden subgraph is the four-vertex <span style="white-space: nowrap;">tree \(K_{1,3}\).</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_graph">line graphs</a>, which have a forbidden subgraph characterization with nine forbidden subgraphs:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/nonline.svg" alt="The nine forbidden induced subgraphs of line graphs" /></p>

<p>However, there might be infinitely many forbidden subgraphs. In many such cases, it is still possible to recognize these graphs in polynomial time, often by a greedy algorithm that removes vertices one at a time based on some local structure. Additionally, in these cases, it is often possible to describe the property of being one of the forbidden subgraphs by a first-order formula, so that the graph class is the class of graphs none of whose subgraphs model that formula. For instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(graph_theory)"><span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(d\)-degenerate</span> graphs</a> are graphs in which no non-empty induced subgraph has all vertices of degree greater <span style="white-space: nowrap;">than \(d\).</span> They can be recognized in polynomial time as the graphs reducible to empty by repeatedly removing low-degree vertices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance-hereditary_graph">distance-hereditary graphs</a> are graphs in which every induced subgraph with two or more vertices has a degree-one vertex, or twins, two vertices with equal closed or open neighborhoods. They can be recognized in polynomial time by repeatedly removing degree-one vertices or merging twins.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chordal_graph">chordal graphs</a> are graphs with no induced cycle of more than three vertices, or the graphs in which every non-empty induced subgraph has a simplicial vertex, a vertex whose neighbors are all adjacent. They can be recognized in polynomial time by repeatedly removing simplicial vertices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_graph">perfect graphs</a> are graphs with no odd induced cycle of more than three vertices, or its complement. They can be recognized in polynomial time but the algorithm is complicated.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, not all hereditary classes are like that; one could, for instance, forbid induced cycles whose lengths belong to an undecidable set of integers, and get a hereditary class of graphs whose recognition problem is again undecidable. But this led me to wonder: is there a connection between the first-order recognizability of the forbidden subgraphs and the polynomial recognizability of the graph class itself? Could it be that every hereditary class defined by a first-order set of forbidden subgraphs is polynomially recognizable?</p>

<p>No!</p>

<p>The counterexample I found is the family of graphs whose forbidden subgraphs are the non-empty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_graph">cubic (3-regular) graphs</a>. Let’s call these the cubic-free graphs. Being cubic is easily expressed in first-order logic, so the forbidden subgraphs for the cubic-free graphs are first-order recognizable. However, under standard assumptions, the cubic-free graphs themselves are not polynomially recognizable: their recognition problem is <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(\mathsf{coNP}\)-complete.</span> Put another way, the problem <small>CUBIC INDUCED SUBGRAPH</small> asking whether a given graph has a non-empty cubic induced subgraph is <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(\mathsf{NP}\)-complete.</span></p>

<p>I found lots of references in the literature to problems of finding non-empty cubic subgraphs (not required to be induced subgraphs; see Garey &amp; Johnson GT32), or to finding cubic induced subgraphs with some constraint on their size, but not to the <small>CUBIC INDUCED SUBGRAPH</small> problem itself. So instead, I found an <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(\mathsf{NP}\)-completeness</span> reduction myself, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-dimensional_matching"><small>3-DIMENSIONAL MATCHING</small></a>, in which the input is a 3-uniform hypergraph (meaning that each hyperedge touches three hypervertices) and one must find a subset of the hyperedges that touches every hypervertex exactly once. An example of my reduction is shown below, from which I think the general case should be more clear.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/3dm23is.svg" alt="NP-completeness reduction from 3-dimensional matching to cubic induced subgraph" /></p>

<p>The input hypergraph is shown with its hypervertices as large blue disks and its hyperedges as medium-sized yellow disks. Inside each of these disks is shown part of a graph, a gadget into which that piece of the hypergraph is translated to form a piece of a <small>CUBIC INDUCED SUBGRAPH</small> instance. The example hypergraph used in the image is 4-regular (every hypervertex touches four hyperedges) but that’s not essential. Once you start making choices of which vertices to include or exclude in an induced subgraph, you can make a chain of inferences from that choice:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you have included a vertex that has only three non-excluded neighbors, you must include all three of them.</li>
  <li>If you have included a vertex that has three included neighbors, you must exclude all its other neighbors.</li>
  <li>If some vertex has fewer than three neighbors that are not excluded, you must exclude it.</li>
</ul>

<p>It follows from this sort of reasoning that the only non-empty cubic induced subgraphs are like the ones shown by the dark red vertices in these gadgets: a vertex for each of the the hyperedges in a matching (such as the matching of dark-yellow hyperedges), and a corresponding subset of the vertices in every hypervertex gadget. Because finding a cubic induced subgraph is <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(\mathsf{NP}\)-complete,</span> its complementary problem, testing whether a graph is cubic-free, is <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(\mathsf{coNP}\)-complete.</span></p>

<p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en">
<p>Here is a short email interview from April 2021 with Michael Brooks from “New Scientist”.</p>
<p><span class="im"><strong>Dear Professor Kalai,</strong> <b>I’m writing a short feature for New Scientist magazine on the theme “Will we ever have a useful quantum computer?”. I’m aware of your work on the problems with noise, and your position that error correction won’t be possible.</b></span></p>
<p>This is correct. My analysis asserts that quality error correction won’t be possible and that even the easier target of <span class="il">HQCA</span> (huge quantum computational advantage) won’t be possible. Here is a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05188">link</a> to my new paper that you may find useful. It refers to recent developments: the Google Sycamore experiment and <span class="il">HQCA</span> claims are discussed in Sections 6 and 7, and there is a new Section 9 regarding the very recent developments.</p>
<p><b>I was wondering whether anything you’ve seen – demonstrations or arguments – in the last few months have done anything to change your mind, or whether you are now more convinced than ever that we won’t ever see truly useful (beyond doing science) quantum computing?  </b></p>
<p>Well, I think that my theory is rather strong but not ironclad. As for the level of my conviction, it does not change often, but roughly speaking there were three stages to my research (and level of conviction):</p>
<p>1) 2005-2013.   What I did was (in hindsight) exploring consequences of the failure of quantum fault tolerance and, on the way, some mistakes in the logic of firmly believing that quantum computers could be built. But, as I often said at that time, I did not think my work then gave a reason for people to change their a priori beliefs.</p>
<p>2) 2013-2019.  Following my work with Guy Kindler I saw a clear scientific argument for why quantum computers will fail. (We first considered the special case of boson sampling and later I extended it in  greater generality.) Since that time, I regard my argument to be strong enough to change people a priori beliefs, and my level of conviction went up as well. But, as I said, it is not an ironclad argument.</p>
<p>3) 2019 – onward.  The experimental claims by Google and later by a group from Hefei, China would, if correct, refute my argument. So, naturally, this casts some doubts also in my mind. However, there are good technical reasons to doubt the fantastic claims by the Hefei group, and on that matter actually my 2014 paper with Kindler comes to play. The situation with the Google experiment is more delicate, but there are reasons to doubt their experimental claims as well.</p>
<p>As for a priori beliefs: In my view the situation is that it is hard to believe that quantum computers are not possible, but it is even harder to believe that quantum computers are possible <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt="🙂" /> . So much experimental and theoretical research is needed before humankind will crack this puzzle.</p>
<p><span class="im"><b>Also, I was wondering if the retraction of the main paper about creating Majorana fermions (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00612-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00612-z</a>) kills topological computing’s hopes of getting us there?</b></span></p>
<p>No, the retraction of a single paper does not kill at all topological computing’s hopes. In fact, the researchers who found the mistake are hopeful that a successful experiment of that kind is possible and are also hopeful regarding further experimental steps towards topological quantum computing.</p>
<p>My general argument does extend to topological quantum computing and asserts that stable topological qubits are not possible.</p>
<p>Thanks for your interest and best wishes,  Gil Kalai</p>
<p><strong>Additional comments:</strong> The (very nice) <a href="https://www.scientiststudy.com/2021/09/why-it-might-be-impossible-to-build.html">article appeared in August 2021</a> and (accurately) refers to my position: “Gil Kalai, a mathematician at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel, argued that the basic noise level in a quantum computer will always be too high, no matter how many qubits are available. ‘My analysis says that correcting quality errors will not be possible.’ ” The article quotes also <a href="https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/persons/sabrina-maniscalco/publications/">Sabrina Maniscalco</a> from the University of Helsinki in Finland who said: “Finding a cure for the effect of environmental noise is not only, in my opinion, a technological problem, but more conceptual and fundamental. I would say that I am optimistic, rather than confident”.</p>
<p>My debate with Aram Harrow over GLL <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2012/01/30/perpetual-motion-of-the-21st-century/">started ten years ago</a>. A lot has happened in these ten years! (Here is a <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2012/01/30/perpetual-motion-of-the-21st-century/#comment-18029">comment</a> from the debate on my assessment of the situation at that time.)</p>
<p>The researchers who took on themselves the thankless task of putting the Microsoft Majorana claims under scrutiny and found the mistakes are <a href="https://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/people/sergey-frolov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sergey Frolov</a> and <a href="https://www.fqt.unsw.edu.au/staff/vincent-mourik-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vincent Mourik</a>. (See also <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00954-8">Frolov’s commentary</a> in “Nature” and <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/major-quantum-computing-strategy-suffers-serious-setbacks-20210929/">this article</a> in “Quanta Magazine”.) They drew important conclusions for the need of sharing raw data and other experimental details for such experiments.</p>

Shortcut sets, introduced by Thorup in 1993, have a wide range of applications in algorithm design, especially in the context of parallel, distributed and dynamic computation on directed graphs. A folklore result in this context shows that every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" />-vertex digraph admits a shortcut set of linear size (i.e., of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="O(n)" class="latex" /> edges) that reduces the diameter to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cwidetilde%7BO%7D%28%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})" class="latex" />. Despite extensive research over the years, the question of whether one can reduce the diameter to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%28%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="o(\sqrt{n})" class="latex" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cwidetilde%7BO%7D%28n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\widetilde{O}(n)" class="latex" /> shortcut edges has been left open.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will present the first improved diameter-sparsity tradeoff for this problem, breaking the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\sqrt{n}" class="latex" /> diameter barrier. Specifically, we show an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E%7B%5Comega%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="O(n^{\omega})" class="latex" />-time randomized algorithm for computing a linear shortcut set that reduces the diameter of the digraph to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cwidetilde%7BO%7D%28n%5E%7B1%2F3%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\widetilde{O}(n^{1/3})" class="latex" />.

<p>A slow month to start 2022, as far as property testing (and myself) are concerned — “only” 3 papers, and a delay of several days in posting this. Let’s jump in with quantum testing!</p>



<p><strong>Testing matrix product states</strong>, by Mehdi Soleimanifar and John Wright (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01824">arXiv</a>). Suppose you are given a state \(|\psi\rangle\) of \(n\) qubits, and want to know “how entangled” this whole thing is: for instance, is \(|\psi\rangle\) a product state (no entanglement between the \(n\) qudits)? More generally, the “amount of entanglement” allowed is captured by an integer \(r\), the<em> bond dimension</em>, where product state corresponds to \(r=1\), and larger \(r\) allows for more entanglement. This paper then considers the following property testing question: how many copies of \(|\psi\rangle\) are needed to test whether it has bond dimension at most \(r\), or is \(\varepsilon\)-far from every such state (in trace distance)? While the case \(r=1\) had been previously considered, this paper considers the general case; and, in particular, shows a qualitative gap between \(r=1\) (for which a constant number of copies, \(O(1/\varepsilon^2)\), suffice) and \(r\geq 2\) (for which they show the number of states is \(\Omega(\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon^2)\), and \(O(n r^2/\varepsilon^2)\)).</p>



<p><strong>Constant-time one-shot testing of large-scale graph states</strong>, by Hayata Yamasaki and Sathyawageeswar Subramanian (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11127">arXiv</a>). In this paper, the authors consider the task of testing if the physical error rate of a given system is below a given threshold — namely, the threshold below which fault-tolerant measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) becomes feasible. Casting this into the framework of property testing, the paper shows that measuring very few (a constant number!) of the input state is enough to test whether the error rate is low.</p>



<p>And, to conclude, a paper which escaped us in December, on private distribution testing:</p>



<p><strong>Pure Differential Privacy from Secure Intermediaries</strong>, by Albert Cheu and Chao Yan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10032">arXiv</a>). Throwback to <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2020/05/news-for-april-2020/">April 2020</a> and <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2021/09/news-for-august-2021/">August 2021</a>, which covered results on distribution testing (uniformity testing!) under the <em>shuffle model</em> of differential privacy. Namely, there was an upper bound of $$ O( k^{2/3}/(\alpha^{4/3}\varepsilon^{2/3})\log^{1/3}(1/\delta) + k^{1/2}/(\alpha\varepsilon) \log^{1/2}(1/\delta) + k^{1/2}/\alpha^2)$$ samples for testing uniformity of distributions over \([k]\), to distance \(\alpha\), under \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)<em>–</em>shuffle privacy (so, <em>approximate</em> privacy: \(\delta&gt;0\)). A partial lower bound existed for <em>pure</em> differential privacy, i.e., when \(\delta=0\): however, no upper bound was known for pure shuffle privacy.<br />Until now: this new paper shows that pure DP basically comes at no cost, by providing an \((\varepsilon,0)\)-shuffle private testing algorithm with sample complexity $$ O( k^{2/3}/(\alpha^{4/3}\varepsilon^{2/3}) + k^{1/2}/(\alpha\varepsilon) + k^{1/2}/\alpha^2)$$ The paper actually does a lot more, focusing on a different problem, private summation; and the testing upper bound is a corollary of the new methods they develop in the process.</p></div>

We prove for some constant $a &gt; 1$, for all $k \leq a$,
$$\mathbf{MATIME}[n^{k + o(1)}] / 1 \not \subset \mathbf{SIZE}[O(n^{k})],$$
for some specific $o(1)$ function. This improves on the Santhanam lower bound, which says there exists constant $c$ such that for all $k &gt; 1$:
$$\mathbf{MATIME}[n^{c k}] / 1 \not \subset \mathbf{SIZE}[O(n^{k})].$$
There is inherently no upper bound on $c$ in Santhanam's proof. Using ideas from Murray and Williams, all $k &gt; 1$:
$$\mathbf{MATIME}[n^{10 k^2}] / 1 \not \subset \mathbf{SIZE}[O(n^{k})].$$
    
Our proof uses a new, very efficient $\mathbf{PCP}$ for $\mathbf{PSPACE}$. We construct a $\mathbf{PCP}$ with unbounded proof length for $\mathbf{SPACE}[O(n)]$ that has a $\tilde{O}(n)$ time verifier, $\tilde{O}(n)$ space prover, $O(\log(n))$ queries, and polynomial alphabet size. Prior to this work, $\mathbf{PCP}$s for $\mathbf{SPACE}[O(n)]$ either used $\Omega(n)$ queries or had verifiers that run in $\Omega(n^2)$ time.</div>

In the JACM paper they have the following passage:</p><div><blockquote>Our result that all languages in NP have zero-knowledge proof systems, has been extended to IP, assuming the same assumptions. (The result was first proved by Impagliazzo and Yung, but since their paper [53] contains only a claim of the result, the interested reader is directed to [11] where a (different proof) appears.) In other words, whatever can be efficiently proven can be efficiently proven in a zero-knowledge manner. This may be viewed as the best result possible, since only languages having interactive proof systems can have zero-knowledge interactive proof systems.<br /><br />11.

<p>Tonight, I took the time actually to read DeepMind’s <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/AlphaCode/competition_level_code_generation_with_alphacode.pdf">AlphaCode paper</a>, and to work through the example contest problems provided, and understand how I would’ve solved those problems, and how AlphaCode solved them.</p>



<p>It is absolutely astounding.</p>



<p>Consider, for example, the “n singers” challenge (pages 59-60). To solve this well, you first need to parse a somewhat convoluted English description, discarding the irrelevant fluff about singers, in order to figure out that you’re being asked to find a positive integer solution (if it exists) to a linear system whose matrix looks like<br />1 2 3 4<br />4 1 2 3<br />3 4 1 2<br />2 3 4 1.<br />Next you need to find a trick for solving such a system without Gaussian elimination or the like (I’ll leave that as an exercise…). Finally, you need to generate code that implements that trick, correctly handling the wraparound at the edges of the matrix, and breaking and returning “NO” for any of multiple possible reasons why a positive integer solution won’t exist.   Oh, and also correctly parse the input.</p>



<p>Yes, I realize that AlphaCode generates a million candidate programs for each challenge, then discards the vast majority by checking that they don’t work on the example data provided, then <em>still</em> has to use clever tricks to choose from among the thousands of candidates remaining. I realize that it was trained on tens of thousands of contest problems and millions of solutions to those problems. I realize that it “only” solves about a third of the contest problems, making it similar to a mediocre human programmer on these problems. I realize that it works only in the artificial domain of programming contests, where a complete English problem specification and example inputs and outputs are always provided.</p>



<p>Forget all that. Judged against where AI was 20-25 years ago, when I was a student, a dog is now holding meaningful conversations in English. And people are complaining that the dog isn’t a very eloquent orator, that it often makes grammatical errors and has to start again, that it took heroic effort to train it, and that it’s unclear how much the dog really understands.</p>



<p>It’s not obvious how you go from solving programming contest problems to conquering the human race or whatever, but I feel pretty confident that we’ve now entered a world where “programming” will look different.</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> A colleague of mine points out that one million, the number of candidate programs that AlphaCode needs to generate, could be seen as roughly exponential in the number of lines of the generated programs.  If so, this suggests a perspective according to which DeepMind has created almost the exact equivalent, in AI code generation, of a non-fault-tolerant quantum computer that’s nevertheless competitive on some task (as in the quantum supremacy experiments). I.e., it clearly does something highly nontrivial, but the “signal” is still decreasing exponentially with the number of instructions, necessitating an exponential number of repetitions to extract the signal and imposing a limit on the size of the programs you can scale to.</p></div>

In this note we show that all sets that are neither finite nor too dense are non-trivial to test in the sense that, for every $\epsilon&gt;0$, distinguishing between strings in the set and strings that are $\epsilon$-far from the set requires $\Omega(1/\epsilon)$ queries. 
Specifically, we show that if, for infinitely many $n$'s, the set contains at least one $n$-bit long string and at most $2^{n-\Omega(n)}$ many $n$-bit strings, then it is non-trivial to test.</div>

<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from 
<a class="entryheader" href="https://scottaaronson.blog" title="Shtetl-Optimized">Scott Aaronson</a>
<p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>Two weeks ago, I <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6232">announced</a> on this blog that, thanks to the remarkable generosity of Jaan Tallinn, and the Speculation Grants program of the <a href="https://survivalandflourishing.fund/">Survival and Flourishing Fund</a> that Jaan founded, I had $200,000 to give away to charitable organizations of my choice.  So, inspired by what Scott Alexander had <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/acx-grants-results">done</a>, I invited the readers of <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> to pitch their charities, mentioning only some general areas of interest to me (e.g., advanced math education at the precollege level, climate change mitigation, pandemic preparedness, endangered species conservation, and any good causes that would enrage the people who attack me on Twitter).</p>



<p>I’m grateful to have gotten more than twenty well-thought-out pitches; you can read a subset of them in the <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6232#comments">comment thread</a>.  Now, having studied them all, I’ve decided—as I hadn’t at the start—to use my entire allotment to make as strong a statement as I can about a single cause: namely, <strong>subject-matter passion and excellence in precollege STEM education</strong>.</p>



<p>I’ll be directing funds to some shockingly cash-starved math camps, math circles, coding outreach programs, magnet schools, and enrichment programs, in Maine and Oregon and England and Ghana and Ethiopia and Jamaica.  The programs I’ve chosen target a variety of ability levels, not merely the “mathematical elite.”  Several explicitly focus on minority and other underserved populations.  But they share a goal of raising every student they work with as high as possible, rather than pushing the students down to fit some standardized curriculum.</p>



<p>Language like that ought to be meaningless boilerplate, but alas, it no longer is.  We live in a time when the state of California, in a misguided pursuit of “modernization” and “equity,” is <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home">poised</a> to eliminate 8th-grade algebra, make it nearly impossible for high-school seniors to take AP Calculus, and shunt as many students as possible from serious mathematical engagement into a “data science pathway” that in practice might teach little more than how to fill in spreadsheets.  (This watering-down effort now <em>itself</em> looks liable to be watered down—but only because of a furious pushback from parents and STEM professionals, pushback in which I’m proud that this blog <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6146">played a small role</a>.)  We live in a time when elite universities are racing to eliminate the SAT—thus, for all their highminded rhetoric, effectively slamming the door on thousands of nerdy kids from poor or immigrant backgrounds who know how to think, but not how to shine in a college admissions popularity pageant.  We live in a time when America’s legendary STEM magnet high schools, from Thomas Jefferson in Virginia to Bronx Science to Lowell in San Francisco, rather than being celebrated as the national treasures that they are, or better yet replicated, are bitterly attacked as “elitist” (even while competitive sports and music programs are not similarly attacked)—and are now being forcibly “demagnetized” by bureaucrats, made all but indistinguishable from other high schools, over the desperate pleas of their students, parents, and alumni.</p>



<p>And—alright, fine, on a global scale, arresting climate change is surely a higher-priority issue than protecting the intellectual horizons of a few teenage STEM nerds.  The survival of liberal democracy is a higher-priority issue.  Pandemic preparedness, poverty, malnutrition are higher-priority issues.  Some of my friends strongly believe that <em>the danger of AI becoming super-powerful and taking over the world</em> is the highest-priority issue … and truthfully, with this week’s announcements of <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/Competitive-programming-with-AlphaCode">AlphaCode</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/formal-math/">OpenAI’s theorem prover</a>, which achieve human-competitive performance in elite programming and math competitions respectively, I can’t confidently declare that they’re wrong.</p>



<p>On the other hand, when you think about the astronomical returns on every penny that was invested in setting a teenage Ramanujan or Einstein or Turing or Sofya Kovalevskaya or Norman Borlaug or Mario Molina onto their trajectories in life … and the comically tiny budgets of the world-leading programs that aim to nurture the <em>next</em> Ramanujans, to the point where $10,000 often seems like a windfall to those programs … well, you might come to the conclusion that the “protecting nerds” thing actually isn’t <em>that</em> far down the global priority list!  Like, it probably cracks the top ten.</p>



<p>And there’s more to it than that.  There’s a reason beyond parochialism, it dawned on me, why individual charities tend to specialize in wildlife conservation in Ecuador or deworming in Swaziland or some other little domain, rather than simply casting around for the highest-priority cause on earth.  <em>Expertise matters</em>—since one wants to make, not only good judgments about which stuff to support, but good judgments that most others can’t or haven’t made.  In my case, it would seem sensible to leverage the fact that I’m Scott Aaronson.  I’ve spent much of my career in math/CS education and outreach—mostly, of course, at the university level, but <em>by god</em> did I personally experience the good and the bad in nearly every form of precollege STEM education!  I’m pretty confident in my ability to distinguish the two, and for whatever I don’t know, I have close friends in the area who I trust.</p>



<p>There’s also a practical issue: in order for me to fund something, the recipient has to fill out a somewhat time-consuming application to SFF.  If I’d added, say, another $20,000 drop into the bucket of global health or sustainability or whatever, there’s no guarantee that the intended recipients of my largesse would even notice, or care enough to go through the application process if they did.  With STEM education, by contrast, holy crap!  I’ve got an inbox full of <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers explaining how their little math program is an intellectual oasis that’s changed the lives of hundreds of middle-schoolers in their region, and how $20,000 would mean the difference between their program continuing or not.  <em>That’s</em> someone who I trust to fill out the form.</p>



<p>Without further ado, then, here are the first-ever Scott Aaronson Speculation Grants:</p>



<ul><li>$57,000 for <a href="https://www.mathcamp.org/">Canada/USA Mathcamp</a>, which changed my life when I attended it as a 15-year-old in 1996, and which I returned to as a lecturer in 2008.  The funds will be used for COVID testing to allow Mathcamp to resume in-person this summer, and perhaps scholarships and off-season events as well.</li><li>$30,000 for <a href="https://www.addiscoder.com/">AddisCoder</a>, which has had spectacular success teaching computer science to high-school students in Ethiopia, placing some of its alumni at elite universities in the US, to help them expand to a new “JamCoders” program in Jamaica.  These programs were founded by UC Berkeley’s amazing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelani_Nelson">Jelani Nelson</a>, also with involvement from friend and <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> semi-regular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boaz_Barak">Boaz Barak</a>.</li><li>$30,000 for the <a href="https://www.mssm.org/">Maine School of Science and Mathematics</a>, which seems to offer a curriculum comparable to those of Thomas Jefferson, Bronx Science, or the nation’s other elite magnet high schools, but (1) on a shoestring budget and (2) in rural Maine.  I hadn’t even heard of MSSM before Alex Altair, an alum and <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> reader, told me about it, but now I couldn’t be prouder to support it.</li><li>$30,000 for the <a href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/nemirovm/emc.html">Eugene Math Circle</a>, which provides a math enrichment lifeline to kids in Oregon, and whose funding was just cut.  This donation will keep the program alive for another year.</li><li>$13,000 for the <a href="https://summerscience.org/">Summer Science Program</a>, which this summer will offer research experiences to high-school juniors in astrophysics, biochemistry, and genomics.</li><li>$10,000 for the <a href="https://misemaths.wordpress.com/">MISE Foundation</a>, which provides math enrichment for the top middle- and high-school students in Ghana.</li><li>$10,000 for <a href="https://www.numberchampions.org.uk/">Number Champions</a>, which provides one-on-one coaching to kids in the UK who struggle with math.</li><li>$10,000 for <a href="https://www.beammath.org/">Bridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics (BEAM)</a>, which runs math summer programs in New York, Los Angeles, and elsewhere for underserved populations.</li><li>$10,000 for <a href="https://powderhouse.org/">Powderhouse</a>, an innovative lab school being founded in Somerville, MA.</li></ul>



<p>While working on this, it crossed my mind that, on my deathbed, I might be at least as happy about having directed funds to efforts like these as about any of my research or teaching.</p>



<p>To the applicants who weren’t chosen: I’m sorry, as many of you had wonderful projects too!  As I said in the earlier post, you remain warmly invited to apply to SFF, and to make your pitch to the other Speculators and/or the main SFF committee.</p>



<p>Needless to say, anyone who feels inspired should add to my (or rather, SFF’s) modest contributions to these STEM programs.  My sense is that, while $200k can go eye-poppingly far in this area, it still hasn’t come <em>close</em> to exhausting even the lowest-hanging fruit.</p>



<p>Also needless to say, the opinions in this post are my own and are not necessarily shared by SFF or by the organizations I’m supporting.  The latter are welcome to disagree with me as long as they keep up their great work!</p>



<p>Huge thanks again to Jaan, to SFF, to my SFF contact Andrew Critch, to everyone (whether chosen or not) who participated in this contest, and to everyone who’s putting in work to broaden kids’ intellectual horizons or otherwise make the world a little less horrible.</p></div>

Margaret O’Mara is a <a href="https://www.margaretomara.com/">historian</a> at the University of Washington. She specializes in the history of Silicon Valley. Of course we are most interested in the future of Silicon Valley. </p>
<p>
Today—between history and the future—we channel her insights to ask what next-big-things may intersect our fields.<br />
<span id="more-19620"></span></p>
<p>
An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/24/technology/silicon-valley-next-big-thing.html">article</a> last week in the New York Times quotes her on recent developments:</p>
<ol>
<li>
“The age of mobile and cloud computing has created so many new business opportunities,” O’Mara said. “But now there are trickier problems.” <p></p>
</li><li>
“Imagine the economic impact of the pandemic had there not been the infrastructure— the hardware and the software— that allowed so many white-collar workers to work from home and so many other parts of the economy to be conducted in a digitally mediated way”, she added.
</li></ol>
<p>
But what’s next?</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Next Big Idea? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The NYT article talks about the future of Silicon Valley as seen by O’Mara and other experts. The main issue is: what are the next big ideas that will come out of Silicon Valley? Big ideas are defined by ones that will change the future and generate billions if not trillions in dollars. Some possible ones are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Self-driving cars; <p></p>
</li><li>
Advanced artificial intelligence; <p></p>
</li><li>
Brain implants—to control devices with only thoughts; <p></p>
</li><li>
Quantum computing; <p></p>
</li><li>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots+%3F%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\dots ?}" class="latex" />
</li></ol>
<p>
The article quotes Jake Taylor, the chief science officer at the quantum start-up <a href="https://www.riverlane.com">Riverlane</a>, as saying that “building a quantum computer might may be the most difficult task ever undertaken, [one that] defies the physics of everyday life.” </p>
<p></p><h2> Next Big Theory Ideas? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I am quite interested in hearing what role complexity theory might play in creating the next big thing. If the area is quantum based then perhaps theory could play a major role. It helped start the explosion in interest in quantum computing. The famous results of Peter Shor on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">factoring</a> could no doubt play a major role. But the paradox is that theory does not seem to be central to thoughts on what the next big idea will be? Even if the idea is quantum based. </p>
<p>
What goal, result, breakthrough will make theory play a major role in the next <b>big idea</b>? </p>
<p>
One answer is to search the Internet. We find that Kurt Mehlhorn has had a course on the main ideas of theory. Perhaps we could imagine a direction for the next big idea based on one of these <a href="http://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/d1/teaching/ss14/gitcs/syllabus.pdf">ideas</a> from his course:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Time vs. Space, P vs. NP, and More. <p></p>
</li><li>
Interactive System, Zero Knowledge Proofs, the PCP Theorem. <p></p>
</li><li>
Expander Graphs. <p></p>
</li><li>
Learning Theory. <p></p>
</li><li>
Streaming Algorithms. <p></p>
</li><li>
Public-Key Cryptography. <p></p>
</li><li>
Linear Programming. <p></p>
</li><li>
Randomness in Computation. <p></p>
</li><li>
Introduction to Approximation Algorithms. <p></p>
</li><li>
Algorithms for Big Data. <p></p>
</li><li>
Algebraic Techniques in Algorithm Design
</li></ol>
<p>
Here are the opening <a href="https://www.anilada.com/courses/15251f18/www/slides/lec1.pdf">slides</a> from a related course at CMU by Anil Ada and Bernhard Haeupler.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Next is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" />? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Another idea is to search for other groups that have more directly looked at possible next ideas. For example: in 2014, a team of technical leaders from the IEEE Computer Society joined forces to write a technical report, entitled <a href="https://www.computer.org/publications/tech-news/trends/2022-report">IEEE CS 2022</a>, surveying 23 technologies that could potentially change the landscape of computer science and industry by the year 2022. By the way, 23 is special: <i>The famous Hilbert Problems are 23 in number.</i> See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_problems">here</a>.</p>
<p>
Here are some of the top few that we might consider. Note we left out some that seem less special for computer science.  That leaves 14 problems.  OK, 14 is the number of Steve Smale’s problems that are fully or partly unresolved according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smale%27s_problems">this</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Security Cross-Cutting Issues The growth of large data repositories and emergence of data analytics have combined with intrusions by bad actors, governments, and corporations to open a Pandora’s box of issues. How can we balance security and privacy in this environment? <p></p>
</li><li>
Sustainability Can electronic cars, LED lighting, new types of batteries and chips, and increasing use of renewables combat rising energy use and an explosion in the uptake of computing? <p></p>
</li><li>
Device and Nanotechnology It is clear that MEMS devices, nanoparticles, and their use in applications are here to stay. Nanotechnology has already been useful in manufacturing sunscreen, tires, and medical devices that can be swallowed. <p></p>
</li><li>
3D Integrated Circuits The transition from printed circuit boards to 3D-ICs is already underway in the mobile arena, and will eventually spread across the entire spectrum of IT products. <p></p>
</li><li>
Photonics Silicon photonics will be a fundamental technology to address the bandwidth, latency, and energy challenges in the fabric of high-end systems. <p></p>
</li><li>
Networking and Interconnectivity Developments at all levels of the network stack will continue to drive research and the Internet economy. <p></p>
</li><li>
Software-Defined Networks OpenFlow and SDN will make networks more secure, transparent, flexible, and functional. <p></p>
</li><li>
High-Performance Computing While some governments are focused on reaching exascale, some researchers are intent on moving HPC to the cloud. <p></p>
</li><li>
The Internet of Things From clothes that monitor our movements to smart homes and cities, the Internet of Things knows no bounds, except for our concerns about ensuring privacy amid such convenience. <p></p>
</li><li>
Natural User Interfaces The long-held dreams of computers that can interface with us through touch, gesture, and speech are finally coming true, with more radical interfaces on the horizon. <p></p>
</li><li>
3D Printing 3D printing promises a revolution in fabrication, with many opportunities to produce designs that would have been prohibitively expensive. <p></p>
</li><li>
Big Data and Analytics The growing availability of data and demand for its insights holds great potential to improve many data-driven decisions. <p></p>
</li><li>
Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems Machine learning plays an increasingly important role in our lives, whether it’s ranking search results, recommending products, or building better models of the environment. <p></p>
</li><li>
Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Unlocking information in pictures and videos has had a major impact on consumers and more significant advances are in the pipeline.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Any thoughts? Can theory play a main role in the future? </p>

<p>Wired runs this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLibNZv5Zd0dyCoQ6f4pdXUFnpAIlKgm3N">video series</a> where topic expert explain concepts to five levels of difficulty, typically a child, teen, undergrad, grad student and expert. UCLA professor Amit Sahai <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c">took this on</a> for zero-knowledge. </p><p>I'd recommend the whole thing but I'd like to focus on the last segment with USC Professor Shanghua Teng (<a href="https://youtu.be/fOGdb1CTu5c?t=1025">starts at 17:05</a>). Amit nicely summed up the importance of the paper.</p><blockquote><p>What was such a beautiful insight is that the idea of zero-knowledge being something that you can already predict. If you can already predict the answer, then you must not be gaining any knowledge by that interaction. This insight of being able to predict the future accurately, and that being an evidence of a lack of new knowledge.</p></blockquote><p>Like Shanghua I was also assigned the seminal zero-knowledge paper by Goldwasser-Micali-Rackoff from my advisor. In many ways the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/22145.22178">original STOC paper</a> was rough. The definitions were buggy, the examples uninspiring. Supposedly the paper didn't even get accepted into a conference in its first try. And yet as you read the paper you realize the potential, the beauty of not one but two new models that would go on to change both cryptography and complexity forever.</p><p>In the fall of 1985 when I started graduate school I took a cryptography class from Manuel Blum. Much of that class was spent on protocols that would convince you that, for example, a number was the product of three primes. By the spring of 1986, Goldreich, Micali and Wigderson distributed <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/116825.116852">their paper</a> showing, among other things, all NP problems has zero-knowledge proofs, making many of the protocols discussed in Blum's course a few months earlier trivial corollaries.</p><p>But it wasn't just zero-knowledge. Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff (and independently <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0000(88)90028-1">Babai and Moran</a>) developed the notion of interactive proof, a proof system with statistical confidence, a model that would lead to probabilistically checkable proofs and helping us understand the limits of approximation.</p><p>I owe most of my early research to the models developed in the GMR paper and glad that Amit has found a way to share these ideas so well.</p></div>
