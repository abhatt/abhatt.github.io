<div class="content">
k-median and k-means are the two most popular objectives for clustering algorithms. Despite intensive effort, a good understanding of the approximability of these objectives, particularly in $\ell_p$-metrics, remains a major open problem. In this paper, we significantly improve upon the hardness of approximation factors known in literature for these objectives in $\ell_p$-metrics. 
 
We introduce a new hypothesis called the Johnson Coverage Hypothesis (JCH), which roughly asserts that the well-studied k-max coverage problem on set systems is hard to approximate to a factor greater than $1-\frac{1}{e}$, even when the membership graph of the set system is a subgraph of the Johnson graph. We then show that together with generalizations of the embedding techniques introduced by Cohen-Addad and Karthik (FOCS '19), JCH implies hardness of approximation results for k-median and k-means in $\ell_p$-metrics for factors which are close to the ones obtained for general metrics. In particular, assuming JCH we show that it is hard to approximate the k-means objective:

$\bullet$ Discrete case: To a factor of 3.94 in the $\ell_1$-metric and to a factor of 1.73 in the $\ell_2$-metric; this improves upon the previous factor of 1.56 and 1.17 respectively, obtained under the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC).

$\bullet$ Continuous case: To a factor of 2.10 in the $\ell_1$-metric and to a factor of 1.36 in the $\ell_2$-metric; this improves upon the previous factor of 1.07 in the $\ell_2$-metric obtained under UGC (and to the best of our knowledge, the continuous case of k-means in $\ell_1$-metric was not previously analyzed in literature).
 
We also obtain similar improvements under JCH for the k-median objective. Additionally, we prove a weak version of JCH using the work of Dinur et al. (SICOMP'05) on Hypergraph Vertex Cover, and recover all the results stated above of Cohen-Addad and Karthik (FOCS '19) to (nearly) the same inapproximability factors but now under the standard NP$\neq$P assumption (instead of UGC).

Finally, we establish a strong connection between JCH and the long standing open problem of determining the Hypergraph Turan number. We then use this connection to prove improved SDP gaps (over the existing factors in literature) for k-means and k-median objectives.</div>

sequence, and has been studied for decades. While the LIS of a sequence of
length $n$ can be computed exactly in time $O(n\log n)$, the complexity of
estimating the (length of the) LIS in sublinear time, especially when LIS $\ll
n$, is still open.
</p>
<p>We show that for any integer $n$ and any $\lambda = o(1)$, there exists a
(randomized) non-adaptive algorithm that, given a sequence of length $n$ with
LIS $\ge \lambda n$, approximates the LIS up to a factor of $1/\lambda^{o(1)}$
in $n^{o(1)} / \lambda$ time.
</p>
<p>Our algorithm improves upon prior work substantially in terms of both
approximation and run-time: (i) we provide the first sub-polynomial
approximation for LIS in sub-linear time; and (ii) our run-time complexity
essentially matches the trivial sample complexity lower bound of
$\Omega(1/\lambda)$, which is required to obtain any non-trivial approximation
of the LIS.
</p>
<p>As part of our solution, we develop two novel ideas which may be of
independent interest: First, we define a new Genuine-LIS problem, where each
sequence element may either be genuine or corrupted. In this model, the user
receives unrestricted access to actual sequence, but does not know apriori
which elements are genuine. The goal is to estimate the LIS using genuine
elements only, with the minimal number of "genuiness tests". The second idea,
Precision Forest, enables accurate estimations for composition of general
functions from "coarse" (sub-)estimates. Precision Forest essentially
generalizes classical precision sampling, which works only for summations. As a
central tool, the Precision Forest is initially pre-processed on a set of
samples, which thereafter is repeatedly reused by multiple sub-parts of the
algorithm, improving their amortized complexity.

After
decades of work, the complexity of most of its variants on general metrics is
now well understood. Surprisingly, this is not the case for a natural setting
that often arises in practice, namely the Euclidean setting, in which the input
points are points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and the distance between them is the
standard $\ell_2$ Euclidean distance. In this work, we study two Euclidean
$k$-Center variants, the Matroid Center problem on the real line and the Robust
Euclidean $k$-Supplier problem, and provide algorithms that improve upon the
best approximation guarantees known for these problems. In particular, we
present a simple $2.5$-approximation algorithm for the Matroid Center problem
on the real line, thus improving upon the $3$-approximation factor algorithm of
Chen, Li, Liang, and Wang (2016) that works for general metrics. Moreover, we
present a $(1 + \sqrt{3})$-approximation algorithm for the Robust Euclidean
$k$-Supplier problem, thus improving upon the state-of-the-art
$3$-approximation algorithm for Robust $k$-Supplier on general metrics and
matching the best approximation factor known for the non-robust setting by
Nagarajan, Schieber and Shachnai (2020).

is the Unique Assembly Verification (UAV) problem. This algorithmic problem
asks whether a given tile system uniquely assembles a specific assembly. The
complexity of this problem in the 2-Handed Assembly Model (2HAM) at a constant
temperature is a long-standing open problem since the model was introduced.
Previously, only membership in the class coNP was known and that the problem is
in P if the temperature is one ($\tau=1$). The problem is known to be hard for
many generalizations of the model, such as allowing one step into the third
dimension or allowing the temperature of the system to be a variable, but the
most fundamental version has remained open.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we prove the UAV problem in the 2HAM is hard even with a small
constant temperature ($\tau = 2$), and finally answer the complexity of this
problem (open since 2013). Further, this result proves that UAV in the staged
self-assembly model is coNP-complete with a single bin and stage (open since
2007), and that UAV in the q-tile model is also coNP-complete (open since
2004). We reduce from Monotone Planar 3-SAT with Neighboring Variable Pairs, a
special case of 3SAT recently proven to be NP-hard. We accompany this reduction
with a positive result showing that UAV is solvable in polynomial time with the
promise that the given target assembly will have a tree-shaped bond graph,
i.e., contains no cycles. We provide a $\mathcal{O}(n^5)$ algorithm for UAV on
tree-bonded assemblies when the temperature is fixed to $2$, and a
$\mathcal{O}(n^5\log \tau)$ time algorithm when the temperature is part of the
input.

representing tractable probability distributions over combinatorial spaces. In
machine learning and probabilistic programming, one is often interested in
understanding whether the distributions learned using PCs are close to the
desired distribution. Thus, given two probabilistic circuits, a fundamental
problem of interest is to determine whether their distributions are close to
each other.
</p>
<p>The primary contribution of this paper is a closeness test for PCs with
respect to the total variation distance metric. Our algorithm utilizes two
common PC queries, counting and sampling. In particular, we provide a poly-time
probabilistic algorithm to check the closeness of two PCs when the PCs support
tractable approximate counting and sampling. We demonstrate the practical
efficiency of our algorithmic framework via a detailed experimental evaluation
of a prototype implementation against a set of 475 PC benchmarks. We find that
our test correctly decides the closeness of all 475 PCs within 3600 seconds.

must be answered within a time limit, is a recurrent operation in the realm of
business process compliance. In this setting, a typical use case is one where a
manager seeks to retrieve all cases where a temporal rule is violated, given an
event log recording the execution of a process over a time period. Existing
approaches for checking temporal rules require a full scan of the log. Such
approaches are unsuitable for interactive use when the log is large and the set
of compliance rules is evolving. This paper proposes an approach to evaluate
temporal compliance rules in sublinear time by pre-computing a data structure
that summarizes the temporal relations between activities in a log. The
approach caters for a wide range of temporal compliance patterns and supports
incremental updates. Our evaluation on twenty real-life logs shows that our
data structure allows for real-time checking of a large set of compliance
rules.

horizon online resource allocation/matching problem, when the corresponding
static planning linear program (SPP) exhibits a non-degeneracy condition called
the general position gap (GPG). The key intuition that we formalize is that the
solution of the reward maximizing SPP is the same as a feasibility LP
restricted to the optimal basic activities, and under GPG this solution can be
tracked with bounded regret by a greedy algorithm, i.e., without the commonly
used technique of periodically resolving the SPP.
</p>
<p>The goal of the decision maker is to combine resources (from a finite set of
resource types) into configurations (from a finite set of feasible
configurations) where each configuration is specified by the number of
resources consumed of each type and a reward. The resources are further
subdivided into three types - offline (whose quantity is known and available at
time 0), online-queueable (which arrive online and can be stored in a buffer),
and online-nonqueueable (which arrive online and must be matched on arrival or
lost).
</p>
<p>Under GRG we prove that, (i) our greedy algorithm gets bounded any-time
regret for matching reward (independent of $t$) when no configuration contains
both an online-queueable and an online-nonqueueable resource, and (ii)
$\mathcal{O}(\log t)$ expected any-time regret otherwise (we also prove a
matching lower bound). By considering the three types of resources, our
matching framework encompasses several well-studied problems such as dynamic
multi-sided matching, network revenue management, online stochastic packing,
and multiclass queueing systems.

has bounded degree. The goal is to find every edge in the graph. This problem
admits a reconstruction algorithm based on multi-phase Voronoi-cell
decomposition and using $\tilde O(n^{3/2})$ distance queries.
</p>
<p>In our work, we analyze a simple reconstruction algorithm. We show that, on
random $\Delta$-regular graphs, our algorithm uses $\tilde O(n)$ distance
queries. As by-products, we can reconstruct those graphs using $O(\log^2 n)$
queries to an all-distances oracle or $\tilde O(n)$ queries to a betweenness
oracle, and we bound the metric dimension of those graphs by $\log^2 n$.

<p>Our reconstruction algorithm has a very simple structure, and is highly

We show a quadratic separation between resolution and cut-free sequent calculus width. We use this gap to get, for the first time, first, a super-polynomial separation between resolution and cut-free sequent calculus for refuting CNF formulas, and secondly, a quadratic separation between resolution width and monomial space in polynomial calculus with resolution.  Our super-polynomial separation between resolution and cut-free sequent calculus only applies when clauses are seen as disjunctions of unbounded arity; our examples have linear size cut-free sequent calculus proofs writing, in a particular way, their clauses using binary disjunctions. Interestingly, this shows that the complexity of sequent calculus depends on how disjunctions are represented.</div>

I have mixed feelings about these efforts. </p><p>Certainly the CMF has its issues, and the FAQs <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/mathfwfaqs.asp">protest too much</a>. But the letter goes too far in the other direction, arguing mainly for the status quo that worked well for those who signed the letter, very few of which have significant experience in K-12 education. The open letter allows for only incremental change unlikely to lead to any significant improvements.</p><p>Before you sign the letter, take a look at the CMF <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/documents/mathfwchapter1.docx">introduction</a></p><p></p><blockquote><p>To develop learning that can lead to mathematical power for all California students, the framework has much to correct; the subject and community of mathematics has a history of exclusion and filtering, rather than inclusion and welcoming. There persists a mentality that some people are “bad in math” (or otherwise do not belong), and this mentality pervades many sources and at many levels. Girls and Black and Brown children, notably, represent groups that more often receive messages that they are not capable of high-level mathematics, compared to their White and male counterparts. As early as preschool and kindergarten, research and policy documents use deficit-oriented labels to describe Black and Latinx and low-income children’s mathematical learning and position them as already behind their white and middle-class peers. These signifiers exacerbate and are exacerbated by acceleration programs that stratify mathematics pathways for students as early as sixth grade.</p><p>Students internalize these messages to such a degree that undoing a self-identity that is “bad at math” to one that “loves math” is rare. Before students have opportunities to excel in mathematics, many often self-select out of mathematics because they see no relevance for their learning, and no longer recognize the inherent value or purpose in learning mathematics.</p></blockquote><p>You may or may not agree with the CMF approach, but it's hard to deny the real challenges they are trying to address and students they are trying to help. If you don't agree with the CMF, work with them to come up with a good alternative that helps create a more inclusive mathematical citizenry. An outright rejection of the approach won't fix problems and probably won't be taken seriously, except from the conservative press.</p></div>

<p>The SIGecom Doctoral Dissertation Award recognizes an outstanding dissertation in the field of economics and computation. The award is conferred annually at the ACM Conference on Economics and Computation and includes a certificate, complimentary conference registration, and an honorarium of $1,500. A certificate may further be given to up to two runners-up. No award may be conferred if the nominations are judged not to meet the standards for the award.</p>



<p>To be eligible, a dissertation must be on a topic related to economics and computation and must have been defended successfully during the calendar year preceding the year of the award presentation.</p>



<p>The next SIGecom Doctoral Dissertation Award will be given for dissertations defended in 2021. Nominations are due by <em>February 28th, 2022</em> (Anywhere on Earth), and must be submitted <a href="mailto:sigecom-awards-diss@acm.org">by email to the Award Committee</a> with “2021 SIGecom Doctoral Dissertation Award” in the subject. A dissertation may be nominated simultaneously for both the SIGecom Doctoral Dissertation Award and the ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award.</p>



<p>Nominations may be made by any member of SIGecom and will typically come from the dissertation supervisor. Self-nomination is not allowed. Nominations for the award <em>must include the following</em>, preferably having items 1, 3, and 4 in a single PDF file:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>A two-page summary of the dissertation, written by the nominee, including bibliographic data and links to publicly accessible versions of published papers based primarily on the dissertation.</li><li>An English-language version of the dissertation in a separate file.</li><li>An endorsement letter of no more than two pages by the nominator, arguing the merit of the dissertation, potential impact, and justification of the nomination. This document should also certify the dissertation defense date.</li><li>The names, email addresses, and affiliations of at least two additional endorsers.</li></ol>



<p>The additional endorsement letters themselves should be <a href="mailto:sigecom-awards-diss@acm.org">sent directly by email</a>, by the same deadline. These endorsements should be no longer than 500 words and should specify the relationship of the endorser to the nominee, contributions of the dissertation, and its potential impact on the field.</p>



<p>It is expected that a nominated candidate, if selected for the award, will attend the next ACM Conference on Economics and Computation on July 11–15, 2022, to accept the award and give a presentation on the dissertation work. The conference will tentatively be held in Boulder, Colorado. The award includes complimentary registration but does not cover travel or accommodation expenses to attend the conference.</p>

<p>The holiday season is just around the corner. Best wishes to you and your loved ones in advance from us here at PTReview. This month, we had <s>four</s> five papers in all. To prepare for the festive mood associated with the onset of December, also included are brief updates on the recently disproven implicit graph conjecture. Let’s dig in. <em>(And please, do let us know if we missed your paper)</em>. </p>



<p>(<strong><em>EDIT</em></strong>: Thanks to our readers for pointing out a paper we missed.)</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Downsampling for Testing and Learning in Product Distributions</strong> by Nathaniel Harms, Yuichi Yoshida (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07449">arXiv</a>). Contemplating on connections in algorithms used for testing a diverse collection of function properties, this paper provides a unified and generalized view of a technique: which the authors call downsampling. As the paper explains, the name is motivated by analogy to image/signal processing tasks. Very often, these tasks involve two steps. In the first step, you break the input domain into “grid cells”. You use oracle calls to the function to obtain a crude approximation over all these cells.  In the second step, you learn this gridded-up or coarsened function cell-by-cell.</p>



<p>This two-step attack could just be what the doctor ordered for your favorite function property testing problem: in particular, it has been put to work for approximately testing visual properties, approximating distance to monotonicity in high dimensions, testing \(k\)-monotone functions, and more. However, if you wanted to obtain property testers using this approach in the distribution-free setup, your ordeal might be far from over. The unknown distribution your domain is equipped with can mess with geometric arguments your gridding approach hopes to exploit. This is precisely the setup considered in the paper (i.e, distribution-free testing of function properties).</p>



<p>The essence of downsampling, is captured by a slick proposition that prescribes coarsening as your goto weapon if the<br />1) fraction of cells on which \(f\) is not constant, and<br />2) a measure of how non-uniform the unknown distribution D your domain is equipped with is </p>



<p>are both small.</p>



<p>Equipped with this machinery,  the paper tackles the task of designing distribution-free testers for boolean monotonicity with the underlying domain being \(\mathbb{R}^d\). The argument is pretty short and improves upon the sample complexity of the corresponding result in the paper by Black-Chakrabarti-Seshadhri. Do check it out, looks like some nice ammo to add to your toolkit.</p>



<p>Let’s stay on board for sublinear time algorithms for gap-edit distance. </p>



<p><strong>Gap Edit Distance via Non-Adaptive Queries: Simple and Optimal</strong> by Elazar Goldenberg, Tomasz Kociumaka, Robert Krauthgamer, Barna Saha (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12706">arXiv</a>). The edit distance problem needs no introduction. This paper studies the problem of approximating edit distance in sublinear time. In particular, this is formalized by introducing the gapped version of the problem. This entails the following computational task: Fix \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) and some \(c &gt; 0\). Given a pair \(x, y\) of strings over a finite alphabet, decide whether the edit distance between \(x,y\) is at most \(k\) or whether it is at least \(k^c\). This paper resolves the non-adaptive query complexity of edit distance and proves that the above gapped version can be decided in at most \(O\left(\frac{n}{k^{c – 1/2}}\right)\) queries. The paper also proves that this bound is almost optimal up to some polylog factors.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Next up, we have <em>time-optimal</em> algorithms for maximum matching and vertex cover! Sweet, right?</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Time-Optimal Sublinear Algorithms for Matching and Vertex Cover</strong> by Soheil Behnezhad (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02942">arXiv</a>). This paper gives algorithms for the classic problem of estimating the size of vertex cover and maximum matching in graphs in sublinear time (in both adjacency matrix and adjacency list models). This is another nice read for the holiday season — after all the paper obtains time-optimal algorithms (up to polylog factors) in both of these models for a multiplicative-additive \((2, \varepsilon n)\) algorithms. Let me set up some historical context to appreciate the maximum matching result better.</p>



<p>In a classic work, Parnas and Ron gave sublinear time algorithms that obtain a \((2,  \varepsilon  n)\) estimate to the size of a maximum matching in a graph using query access to the adjacency list in sublinear time. Their sublinear time algorithm is inspired by ideas with roots in distributed algorithms. In particular, their algorithm returns in time<br />\(\Delta^{O(\log {\frac{\delta}{\varepsilon}})}\) (where \(\Delta = \Delta(G)\) denotes the degree bound) an estimate \(\text{EST}\) to the size of the max-matching where \(OPT \leq \text{EST} \leq 2 \cdot OPT + \varepsilon  n\). Unfortunately, algorithms in this Parnas-Ron Framework must necessarily suffer a quasi-polynomial running time because of lower bounds from distributed algorithms. Using a randomized greedy approach to estimating the size of a maximum matching, Yoshida, Yamamoto, and Ito gave the first algorithm which returned a \((2,  \varepsilon n)\)-estimate to maximum matching in time \(poly(\Delta/\varepsilon)\). This is where the story essentially froze — though there were results that improved the dependence on \(\Delta\) to \(O(\Delta^2)\). Unfortunately, this is not truly sublinear for large \(\Delta\). In another direction, Kapralov-Mitrovic-Norouzi Fard-Tardos gave an algorithm that estimates the maximum matching size in time \(O(\Delta)\) (which is truly sublinear) but it no longer guarantees a \((2,  \varepsilon  n)\)-approximation and instead returns a \((O(1),  \varepsilon  n)\)-approximation. The current paper, as remarked above achieves the best of both worlds.</p>



<p></p>











<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Final stop, updates on the implicit graph conjecture.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>The Implicit Graph Conjecture is False</strong> by Hamed Hatami, Pooya Hatami (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13198">arXiv</a>). While not a property testing paper per se, it is always good to see an old conjecture resolved one way or the other. In this paper, the Hatami brothers (Pooya and Hamed) refute a three decade old conjecture — the one mentioned in the title. Here is a brief history. Sampath Kannan, Moni Naor and Steven Rudich defined the notion of implicit representation of graphs. Take a family of \(\mathcal{F}\) of graphs and consider a \(n\) vertex graph \(G \in \mathcal{F}\). You say this family admits an efficient implicit representation if there exists an assignment of \(O(\log n)\) length labels to all the vertices in \(V(G)\) such that the adjacencies between every pair of vertices is a function of the labels of the corresponding pair. Crucially, the labeling function may depend on the family, but not on individual graphs in the family. What is cool about families admitting such an efficient implicit representation, is that the number of \(n\)-vertex graphs in this family cannot be any bigger than \(2^{O(n \log n)}\) — that is such families have at most factorial growth rate. Implicit graph conjecture asserts that for every hereditary graph family, the converse also holds. Namely, if the hereditary family has at most factorial growth rate, then the family admits efficient implicit representations. The key, as shown in this paper (which spans all of six pages!) is to choose as your hereditary graph class, the closure of a random collection of graphs. The authors show that now your hand is forced and your representation will no longer be efficient. However, annoyingly, your hereditary graph class need not have a factorial growth rate as taking the closure of a random collection expands to contain all graphs and has growth rate \(2^{\Omega(n^2)}\). The cool thing is, you can avoid this issue by choosing a random collection of slightly sparse random graphs (with \(n^{2-\varepsilon}\) edges). Interestingly, this gives you enough ammo to finally control the growth rate which in turn allows the authors to slay this conjecture.</p>



<p>(<strong><em>EDIT</em></strong>: Omitted Stop, added retroactively). </p>



<p><strong>Sublinear quantum algorithms for estimating von Neumann entropy</strong> by Tom Gur, Min-Hsiu Hsieh, Sathyawageeswar Subramanian (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11139">arXiv</a>). This paper presents quantum algorithms for the problem of obtaining multiplicative estimates of the Shannon entropy of the familiar classical distributions and the more exotic von Neumann entropy of mixed quantum systems. In particular, the paper presents an \(\widetilde{O}(n^{\frac{1+\eta }{2\gamma^2 }})\)-query quantum algorithm that achieves a \(\gamma\)-multiplicative approximation algorithm for the Shannon Entropy of an input distribution \(\mathbf{p}\) supported on a universe of size \(n\) where \(H(\mathbf{p}) \geq \gamma/\eta\). As if this were not already cool enough, the paper also presents sublinear quantum algorithms for estimating Von Neumann Entropy as well. This is supplemented by a lower bound of \(\Omega(n^{\frac{1}{3 \gamma^2}})\) queries for achieving a \(\gamma\)-factor approximation for any of these two kinds of entropies. </p></div>

(Guest Post by Hunter Monroe)
   

In this  guest post and <a href="https://speedupblogger.wordpress.com/2021/12/05/unifying-conjectures-on-complexity-and-noncomputability/">discussion paper</a>, I present a remarkable set of structurally similar conjectures which, if you only believe them, conjure up a dream world for theorists by asserting a new form of diagonalization based on naturally nonrelativizing facts invoking a deep linkage to underlying noncomputable languages. These conjectures, all stronger than the things to be proved, imply that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse because the arithmetic hierarchy does not collapse, and P≠NP≠coNP. The diagonalizations imply the existence of hard instances, with the result that many complexity classes have speedup, including the Π side of PH, and proof speedup for tautologies stems from proof speedup for arithmetic. These conjectures do two things: (1) let us explore a hypothetical world where many open problems about uniform complexity classes are resolved and consider steps beyond e.g. to circuit complexity, and (2) reduce numerous open questions to a single plausible claim about how Turing machines have limited information about noncomputable languages. This would potentially allow a slew of open questions to be resolved at once with a skeleton key.<p>The following <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0906.3765">conjecture</a> implying $\textbf{P!=NP}$ is remarkable: it hints at a deeper, unnoticed relationship between complexity and noncomputability; it is <a href="https://www2.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~krajicek/scan10.pdf">equivalent</a> to speedup for all paddable $\textbf{coNP}$-complete languages and in proof length for tautologies; tweaked versions would separate other complexity classes; and if true it is a nonrelativizing fact.</p><p></p>



Conjecture: (*) For any deterministic TM $M$ accepting the $\textbf{coNP}$-complete language ``nondeterministic TM $N$ on input $x$ does not halt within $t$ steps'' ($\texttt{coBHP}$), there exists a $\langle N',x'\rangle\in\texttt{coHP}$ ($N'$ does not halt on $x'$, ever) with $M$'s running time $f(t)=T_M(N',x',1^t)$ not bounded by any polynomial.

<p></p>

If true, (*) is a nonrelativizing fact; there is no hard $\langle N, x\rangle$ for $M$ with an exponential time oracle. The noncomputable language $\texttt{coHP}$ potentially explains why (*) is true, by analogy with this trivial theorem:

<p></p>


Theorem. For any $M$ accepting $\texttt{coBHP}$, there exists some non-halting $\langle N',x'\rangle\in\texttt{coHP}$ with $f(t)=T_M(N',x',1^t)$ not bounded by a constant.

<p></p>


Otherwise, $M$ would accept $\texttt{coHP}$ and have too much information about a non-c.e. language; (*) is just a stronger version. In the extreme, any $M$ is completely ignorant about some $\langle N',x'\rangle$ and requires on the order of $2^t$ steps to rule out every potentially halting branch.  Tweaking (*) yields conjectures implying that $\textbf{PH}$ does not collapse:

<p></p>


Conjectures: For any $M^{\Pi^p_i}$ that accepts $\Pi^p_{i+1}=\{\langle N^{\Pi^p_i},x,1^t\rangle|$ $N^{\Pi^p_i}$ does not halt on input $x$ in $t$ steps$\}$, there is a non-halting $\langle N'^{\Pi^p_i},x'\rangle\in \Pi_i$ with $M^{\Pi^p_i}$'s running time not bounded by any polynomial.

<p></p>


By invoking every level $\Pi_i$ of the arithmetic hierarchy ($\textbf{AH}$), these conjectures state that the noncollapse $\textbf{PH}$ is due to the noncollapse of $\textbf{AH}$. The conjecture (*) can be calibrated depending on the desired separation to equip $M$ with an oracle or nondeterminism or constrain its resources, to choose a resource-bounded complete problem and underlying non-c.e. language, and to fine tune how hard a hard instance needs to be.

<p></p>


Proof speedup for tautologies (equivalent to (*)) may stem from the proof speedup for arithmetic that occurs when adding undecidable statements as new axioms, allowing new theorems to be proved and shortening the proof of existing theorems. This literature translates any arithmetic theorem free of existential quantifiers into a tautology by replacing $k$-bit numbers with $k$ Boolean variables. The analogy with (*) suggests this stronger conjecture may in fact also be equivalent:

<p></p>


Conjecture: The following two statements are equivalent: (1) there is no optimal propositional proof system; and (2) Any propositional proof system $P$ is outperformed by a sufficiently powerful conservative extension $T$ of the Peano arithmetic, and $T$ can be improved further by adding any undecidable statement in $T$ as a new axiom.

<p></p>


So (*) is a Swiss army knife for generating conjectures that give us a vision of a world in which answering essentially one question would serve as a skeleton key that unlocks many open problems.</div>

Entropy is a fundamental property of both classical and quantum systems, spanning myriad theoretical and practical applications in physics and computer science. We study the problem of obtaining estimates to within a multiplicative factor $\gamma&gt;1$ of the Shannon entropy of probability distributions and the von Neumann entropy of mixed quantum states. Our main results are:

       $\quad\bullet$ an $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( n^{\frac{1+\eta}{2\gamma^2}}\right)$-query quantum algorithm that outputs a $\gamma$-multiplicative approximation of the Shannon entropy $H(\mathbf{p})$ of a classical probability distribution $\mathbf{p} = (p_1,\ldots,p_n)$;
       $\quad\bullet$ an $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( n^{\frac12+\frac{1+\eta}{2\gamma^2}}\right)$-query quantum algorithm that outputs a $\gamma$-multiplicative approximation of the von Neumann entropy $S(\rho)$ of a density matrix $\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$.

    In both cases, the input is assumed to have entropy bounded away from zero by a quantity determined by the parameter $\eta&gt;0$, since, as we prove, no polynomial query algorithm can multiplicatively approximate the entropy of distributions with arbitrarily low entropy. In addition, we provide $\Omega\left(n^{\frac{1}{3\gamma^2}}\right)$ lower bounds on the query complexity of $\gamma$-multiplicative estimation of Shannon and von Neumann entropies.

    We work with the quantum purified query access model, which can handle both classical probability distributions and mixed quantum states, and is the most general input model considered in the literature.</div>

Motivated by the goal of showing stronger structural results about the complexity of learning, we study the learnability of strong concept classes beyond P/poly, such as PSPACE/poly and EXP/poly. We show the following:


1. (Unconditional Lower Bounds for Learning)  Building on [KKO13], we prove unconditionally that BPE/poly cannot be weakly learned in polynomial time over the uniform distribution, even with membership and equivalence queries.

2. (Robustness of Learning) For the concept classes EXP/poly and PSPACE/poly, we show unconditionally that worst-case and average-case learning are equivalent, that PAC-learnability and learnability over the uniform distribution are equivalent, and that membership queries do not help in either case.

3. (Reducing Succinct Search to Decision for Learning) For the decision problems $R_{Kt}$ and $R_{KS}$ capturing the complexity of learning EXP/poly and PSPACE/poly respectively, we show a succinct search to decision reduction: for each of these problems, the problem is in BPP iff there is a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm computing circuits encoding proofs for positive instances of the problem. This is shown via a more general result giving succinct search to decision results for PSPACE, EXP and NEXP, which might be of independent interest. 

4. (Implausibility of Oblivious Strongly Black-Box Reductions showing NP-hardness of learning NP/poly) We define a natural notion of hardness of learning with respect to oblivious strongly black-box reductions. We show that learning PSPACE/poly is PSPACE-hard with respect to oblivious strongly black-box reductions. On the other hand, if learning NP/poly is NP-hard with respect to oblivious strongly black-box reductions, the Polynomial Hierarchy collapses.</div>

We show that any nonzero polynomial in the ideal generated by the $r \times r$ minors of an $n \times n$ matrix $X$ can be used to efficiently approximate the determinant. Specifically, for any nonzero polynomial $f$ in this ideal, we construct a small depth-three $f$-oracle circuit that approximates the $\Theta(r^{1/3}) \times \Theta(r^{1/3})$ determinant in the sense of border complexity. For many classes of algebraic circuits, this implies that every nonzero polynomial in the ideal generated by $r \times r$ minors is at least as hard to approximately compute as the $\Theta(r^{1/3}) \times \Theta(r^{1/3})$ determinant. We also prove an analogous result for the Pfaffian of a $2n \times 2n$ skew-symmetric matrix and the ideal generated by Pfaffians of $2r \times 2r$ principal submatrices.

This answers a recent question of Grochow about complexity in polynomial ideals in the setting of border complexity. Leveraging connections between the complexity of polynomial ideals and other questions in algebraic complexity, our results provide a generic recipe that allows lower bounds for the determinant to be applied to other problems in algebraic complexity. We give several such applications, two of which are highlighted below.
	
$\bullet$ We prove new lower bounds for the Ideal Proof System of Grochow and Pitassi. Specifically, we give super-polynomial lower bounds for refutations computed by low-depth circuits. This extends the recent breakthrough low-depth circuit lower bounds of Limaye, Srinivasan, and Tavenas to the setting of proof complexity. Moreover, we show that for many natural circuit classes, the approximative proof complexity of our hard instance is governed by the approximative circuit complexity of the determinant.

$\bullet$ We construct new hitting set generators for the closure of low-depth circuits. For any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we construct generators with seed length $O(n^\varepsilon)$ that hit $n$-variate low-depth circuits. Our generators attain a near-optimal tradeoff between their seed length and degree, and are computable by low-depth circuits of near-linear size (with respect to the size of their output). This matches the seed length of the generators recently obtained by Limaye, Srinivasan, and Tavenas, but improves on the degree and circuit complexity of the generator.</div>

The journey leading to the establishment of this new journal has been long and the fact that this path eventually reached its destination is due to the sterling efforts and foresight of a number of people within our community. The seeds of TheoretiCS were sown within the Council of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science during my two terms as president of that association. At that time, <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/people/jos-baeten" target="_blank">Jos Baeten</a> and <a href="https://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/kucera/">Antonin Kucera</a> worked hard to try and set up an open-access journal of the association. That journal never saw the light of day, but the process that eventually led to TheoretiCS was afoot. After some time, <a href="https://ls1-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/en/kontakt-thomas-schwentick" target="_blank">Thomas Schwentick</a> took the baton in the relay race and took decisive steps in turning the establishment of this new journal into a true community effort. It is fair to say that the launch of this journal has involved an unprecedented level of cooperation amongst <a href="https://theoretics.episciences.org/page/advisory-board" target="_blank">representatives of leading conferences from across the entire Theoretical Computer Science community</a>. I am immensely grateful to everyone who participated in that work for the effort they put into making TheoretiCS a reality and apologise for not mentioning all the colleagues who contributed explicitly in this post.   You can find more information on TheoretiCS in the text below, which I received from Jos Baeten, founding member-at-large of the Advisory Board of the Theoretics Foundation. </p><p>So, what can you do to support this new journal? There are at least two things that each of us can do and that I believe are important. </p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Help TheoretiCS reach its quality objectives by submitting your best work to it and by encouraging your colleagues to do so too. TheoretiCS aims at publishing articles of a very high quality, and at becoming a reference journal on par with the leading journals in the area. To be accepted, a paper must make a significant contribution of lasting value to a relevant area of TCS, and its presentation must be of high quality. This is elaborated upon in the guiding principles spelled out below. I let you reach your own conclusions about the quality and the breadth of the <a href="https://theoretics.episciences.org/page/editorial-board" target="_blank">editorial board of TheoretiCS</a>, which is stellar IMHO. <br /></li><li>Spread the news of the launch of TheoretiCS within your networks. Despite its many years of existence and the role it plays within our community, I still meet colleagues (even in Theoretical Computer Science) who do not know that <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics" target="_blank">LIPIcs</a> exists and who claim that publishing conference proceedings with commercial publishers is a sign of scientific quality. </li></ol><p>If you happen to be in a position to do so, you can support the <a href="https://theoretics.episciences.org/page/theoretics-foundation" target="_blank">TheoretiCS foundation</a>, which is a German not-for-profit organization, by making a donation. </p><p></p><p>I look forward to seeing the developments of TheoretiCS. Even though predicting the future is difficult, I have no doubt that the journal will become a coveted outlet, with the help of the community it aims to serve. Welcome to TheoretiCS and good luck!</p><p></p><p><br />=== Additional information about the journal ===<br /><br />---  Guiding principles and objectives  ---<br /><br />- We believe that our field (and science in general) needs more 'virtuous' open-access journals, a whole eco-system of them, with various levels of specialization and of selectivity. We also believe that, along with the structuring role played by conferences in theoretical computer science, we collectively need to re-develop the practice of journal publications.<br /><br />- The scope of TheoretiCS is the whole of Theoretical Computer Science, understood in an inclusive meaning (concretely: including, but not restricted to, the Theory of Computing and the Theory of Programming; or equivalently, the so-called TCS-A and TCS-B, reminiscent of Jan van Leeuwen's Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science).<br /><br />- Our aim is to rapidly become a reference journal and to contribute to the unity of the Theoretical Computer Science global community. In particular, we will seek to publish only papers that make a very significant contribution to their respective fields, that strive to be accessible to a wider audience within theoretical computer science, and that are, generally, of a quality on par with the very best journals in the field.<br /><br />- TheoretiCS adheres to the principles of 'virtuous' open-access: there is no charge to read the journal, nor to publish in it. The copyright of the papers remains with the authors, under a Creative Commons license.<br /><br /><br />---  Editorial Board  ---<br /><br />The inaugural Editors-in-Chief are Javier Esparza (TU München) and Uri Zwick (Tel Aviv U.). The entire Editorial Board can be seen at <a href="https://theoretics-journal.org">https://theoretics-journal.org</a> (see below as well).<br /><br /><br />---  Organization and a bit of history  ---<br /><br />The project built on groundwork laid in the Council of the EATCS, and started in 2019 and underwent a long gestation. From the start, we wanted to have a thorough discussion with a wide representation of the community, on how to best implement the guiding principles sketched above. It was deemed essential to make sure that all fields of theoretical computer science would feel at home in this journal, and that it would be recognized as a valid venue for publication all over the world.<br /><br />This resulted in the creation of an Advisory Board, composed of representatives of most of the main conferences in the field (currently APPROX, CCC, COLT, CONCUR, CSL, FOCS, FoSSaCS, FSCD, FSTTCS, ICALP, ICDT, ITCS, LICS, MFCS, PODC, SoCG, SODA, STACS, STOC, TCC) and of so-called members-at-large. The composition of this Advisory Board, which may still evolve, can be consulted at <a href="https://theoretics-journal.org">https://theoretics-journal.org</a>.<br /><br /><br />---  Logistics and answers to some natural questions  ---<br /><br />- The journal is published by the TheoretiCS Foundation, a non-profit foundation established under German law. <br /><br />- TheoretiCS is based on the platform episciences.org, in the spirit of a so-called overlay journal.<br /><br />- The Advisory Board, together with the Editors-in-Chief and the Managing Editors, devolved much of their efforts to designing and implementing an efficient 2-phase review system: efficient in terms of the added-value it brings to the published papers and their authors, and of the time it takes. Yet, as this review system relies in an essential fashion on the work and expertise of colleagues (like in all classical reputable journals), we cannot guarantee a fixed duration for the evaluation of the papers submitted to TheoretiCS.<br /><br />- Being charge-free for authors and readers does not mean that there is no cost to publishing a journal. These costs are supported for the foreseeable future by academic institutions (at the moment, CNRS and Inria, in France; others may join).<br /><br />- The journal will have an ISSN, and each paper will have a DOI. There will be no print edition.<br /><br /><br />---  Editorial Board  ---<br /><br />Editors-in-Chief<br /><br />    Javier Esparza (Technische Universität München, Munich)<br />    Uri Zwick (Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv)<br /><br />Managing  Editors<br /><br />    Antoine Amarilli (Institut polytechnique de Paris, Télécom Paris)<br />    Nathanaël Fijalkow (CNRS, Bordeaux, and The Alan Turing Institute of Data Science, London)<br /><br />Editors<br /><br />    Martin Abadi, Google, USA<br />    Andris Ambainis, U. of Latvia<br />    Albert Atserias, UPC, Barcelona<br />    Haris Aziz, UNSW, Sydney<br />    David Basin, ETH Zürich<br />    Patricia Bouyer, CNRS, Paris-Saclay<br />    Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Università di Milano<br />    Anuj Dawar, Cambridge University<br />    Luc Devroye,  McGill University, Montreal<br />    Jacob Fox, Stanford University<br />    Mohsen Ghaffari, ETH Zürich<br />    Georg Gottlob, Oxford University<br />    Anupam Gupta, Carnegie-Mellon University<br />    Venkatesan Guruswami, Carnegie-Mellon University<br />    Johan Håstad, KTH, Stockholm<br />    Ravi Kannan, Microsoft Research India, Bengaluru<br />    Anna Karlin, University of Washington, Seattle<br />    Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi, National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo<br />    Valerie King, University of Victoria<br />    Robert Kleinberg, Cornell University<br />    Naoki Kobayashi, University of Tokyo<br />    Elias Koutsoupias, Oxford University<br />    Xavier Leroy, Collège de France, Paris<br />    Katrina Ligett, Hebrew University, Jerusalem<br />    Rupak Majumdar, MPI-SWS, Kaiserslautern<br />    Joseph Mitchell, State University of New York at Stony Brook<br />    Mehryar Mohri, Google and New York University<br />    David Mount, University of Maryland<br />    Anca Muscholl, Université de Bordeaux<br />    Danupon Nanongkai, University of Copenhagen<br />    Moni Naor, Weizmann Institute, Rehovot<br />    Catuscia Palamidessi, Inria, Palaiseau<br />    Michał Pilipczuk, University of Warsaw<br />    Jean-Francois Raskin, Université Libre de Bruxelles<br />    Peter Sanders, KIT, Karlsruhe<br />    Davide Sangiorgi, Università di Bologna<br />    Nitin Saxena, IIT Kanpur<br />    Alistair Sinclair, UC Berkeley<br />    Ola Svensson, EPF Lausanne<br />    Gregory Valiant, Stanford University<br />    Stephanie Weirich, University of Pennsylvania<br />    Virginia V.

<p>This is a blog post written by me (Boaz) with Edith Cohen. It is cross posted on <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6146">Scott Aaronson’s blog</a>. See also <a href="https://twitter.com/boazbaraktcs/status/1466799615349608452?s=20">a thread on Twitter</a>.</p>



<p>See also the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home">open letter</a>, and <a href="https://bit.ly/cmfanalysis">fuller analysis</a> of the CMF proposed revisions.</p>



<p>Mathematical education at the K-12 level is critical for preparation for STEM careers. An ongoing challenge to the US K-12 system is to improve the preparation of students for advanced mathematics courses and expand access and enrollment in these courses. As stated by a <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/datastory/stem/algebra/index.html#WHYALGEBRAI">Department of Education report</a> <strong><em>“taking Algebra I before high school … can set students up for a strong foundation of STEM education and open the door for various college and career options.”</em></strong> The report states that while 80% of all students have access to Algebra I in middle school, only 24% enroll. This is also why the goal of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/07/education/algebra-project-bob-moses-empowers-students.html">Bob Moses’ Algebra Project</a> is to ensure that <strong>“every child must master algebra, preferably by eighth grade, for algebra is the gateway to the college-prep curriculum, which in turn is the path to higher education.” </strong></p>



<p>The most significant potential for growth is among African American or Latino students, among whom only 12% enroll in Algebra before high school. This untapped potential has longer-term implications for both society and individuals. For example, although African Americans and Latinos comprise 13% and 18% (respectively) of the overall US population, they only account for 4% and 11% of <a href="https://ira.asee.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2018-Engineering-by-Numbers-Engineering-Statistics-UPDATED-15-July-2019.pdf">engineering degrees</a>. There is also a gap in access by income: Calculus is <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/unequal-access-calculus-could-hinder-low-income-and-black-students">offered</a> in 92% of schools serving the top income quartile but only in 77% of schools serving the bottom quartile (as measured by the share of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch). Thus minority and low income students have less access to STEM jobs, which yield <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/stem-employment.htm">more than double the median salary</a> of non-STEM jobs, and are projected to grow at a 50% higher rate over the next decade.</p>



<p>Given these disparities, we applaud efforts such as the <a href="https://algebra.org/wp/">Algebra Project</a>, the <a href="http://thecalculusproject.org/">Calculus Project</a>, and <a href="https://www.beammath.org">Bridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics</a> that increase access to advanced mathematical education to underserved students (in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/07/education/algebra-project-bob-moses-empowers-students.html">Bob Moses’ words</a> <strong><em>“raise the floor”</em></strong>). However, we are concerned by recent approaches, such as the proposed <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/">California Math Framework</a> (CMF) revisions,  that take the opposite direction.</p>



<p>See <a href="https://bit.ly/cmfanalysis">this document for a detailed analysis and critique of the CMF</a>, but the bottom line is that rather than trying to elevate under-served students, <strong>such “reforms” reduce access and options for all students</strong>. In particular, the CMF encourages schools to stop offering Algebra I in middle school, while placing obstacles (such as doubling-up, compressed courses, or outside-of-school private courses) in the way of those who want to take advanced math in higher grades. When similar reforms were implemented in San Francisco, they <a href="https://edsource.org/2021/one-districts-faulty-data-shouldnt-drive-californias-math-policy/663374">resulted</a> in an <strong><em>“inequitable patchwork scheme”</em></strong> of workarounds that affluent students could access but that their less privileged counterparts could not. The CMF also promotes<strong> trendy and shallow courses</strong> (such as a nearly math-free version of  “data science”) as recommended alternatives  to<strong> foundational mathematical courses</strong> such as Algebra and Calculus. These courses do not prepare students <a href="https://bit.ly/cmfanalysis">even for careers in data science itself</a>!</p>



<p>As educators and practitioners, we have seen first-hand the value of solid foundations in mathematics for pursuing college-level STEM education and a productive STEM career. </p>



<p>While well-intentioned, <strong>we believe that many of the changes proposed by the CMF are deeply misguided and will disproportionately harm under-resourced students</strong>. Adopting them would result in a student population that is less prepared to succeed in STEM and other 4-year quantitative degrees in college.  The CMF <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/documents/mathfwchapter7.docx">states</a> that <strong><em>“many students, parents, and teachers encourage acceleration beginning in grade eight (or sooner) because of mistaken beliefs that Calculus is an important high school goal.”</em></strong> Students, parents, and teachers <strong><em>are not mistaken</em></strong>. Neither is the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), which set in 2015 a goal to double the number of African American students taking calculus by 2025. Calculus is not the only goal of K-12 math education, but it <em>is</em> important for students who wish to prepare for STEM in college and beyond. </p>



<p>We agree that calculus is not the “be-all and end-all” of high-school mathematics education. In particular, we encourage introducing options such as logic, probability, discrete mathematics, and algorithms design in the K-12 curriculum, as they can be valuable foundations for STEM education in college. However, when taught beyond a superficial level (which unfortunately is <em>not</em> the case in the CMF “data science” <a href="https://hsdatascience.youcubed.org/">proposals</a>), these topics are not any easier  than calculus. They require the same foundations of logic, algebra, and functions, and fluency with numbers and calculations. Indeed, the career paths with the highest potential for growth require <a href="https://pub.towardsai.net/the-era-of-the-mathematician-has-arrived-39ec20b24aa6">more and deeper mathematical preparation</a> than ever before. Calculus and other mathematical foundations are not important because they are admission requirements for colleges, or because they are relics of the <a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/math-curriculum/">“Sputnik era”</a>. They are important because they provide fundamental knowledge and ways of thinking that are necessary for success in these fast growing and in-demand fields.</p>



<p>We also fully support incorporating introductory data analysis and coding skills in the K-12 curriculum (and there are some <a href="https://coursekata.org/">good</a> <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/ap/2022/">approaches</a> for doing so).  But we strongly disagree with marketing such skills as replacing foundational skills in algebra and calculus when preparing for 4-year college degrees in STEM and other quantitative fields. These topics are important and build on basic math foundations but are not a replacement for such foundations any more than social media skills can replace reading and writing foundations. </p>



<p>Given the above, we, together with <strong>more than 150 scientists, educators, and practitioners in STEM</strong>, have signed an <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home"><strong>open letter expressing our concerns with such trends</strong></a>. The signatories include STEM faculty in public and private universities and practitioners from industry. They include educators with decades of experience teaching students at all levels, as well as researchers that won the highest awards in their fields, including the Fields Medal, the Nobel Prize, and the Turing Award. Signers also include people vested in mathematical high-school education, such as Adrian Mims (founder of <a href="http://thecalculusproject.org/">The Calculus Project</a>) and Jelani Nelson (UC Berkeley EECS professor and founder of <a href="https://www.addiscoder.com/">AddisCoder</a>) who have spearheaded projects to increase access to underserved populations.</p>



<p>We encourage you to read the letter, and if you are a US-based STEM professional or educator, consider signing it as well: <a href="https://bit.ly/mathedletter">https://bit.ly/mathedletter</a><br /></p>



<p>Unfortunately, in recent years, debates on US education have become politicized. The letter is not affiliated with any political organization, and we believe that the issues we highlight transcend current political debates. After all, expanding access to mathematical education is both socially just and economically wise.</p>

This is also why the goal of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/07/education/algebra-project-bob-moses-empowers-students.html">Bob Moses’ Algebra Project</a> is to ensure that <strong>“every child must master algebra, preferably by eighth grade, for algebra is the gateway to the college-prep curriculum, which in turn is the path to higher education.”</strong></p>



<p>The most significant potential for growth is among African American or Latino students, among whom only 12% enroll in Algebra before high school. This untapped potential has longer-term implications for both society and individuals. For example, although African Americans and Latinos comprise 13% and 18% (respectively) of the overall US population, they only account for 4% and 11% of <a href="https://ira.asee.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2018-Engineering-by-Numbers-Engineering-Statistics-UPDATED-15-July-2019.pdf">engineering degrees</a>. There is also a gap in access by income: Calculus is <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/unequal-access-calculus-could-hinder-low-income-and-black-students">offered</a> in 92% of schools serving the top income quartile but only in 77% of schools serving the bottom quartile (as measured by the share of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch). Thus minority and low income students have less access to STEM jobs, which yield <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/stem-employment.htm">more than double the median salary</a> of non-STEM jobs, and are projected to grow at a 50% higher rate over the next decade.</p>



<p>Given these disparities, we applaud efforts such as the <a href="https://algebra.org/wp/">Algebra Project</a>, the <a href="http://thecalculusproject.org/">Calculus Project</a>, and <a href="https://www.beammath.org">Bridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics</a> that increase access to advanced mathematical education to underserved students. However, we are concerned by recent approaches, such as the proposed <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/">California Math Framework</a> (CMF) revisions,  that take the opposite direction.</p>



<p>See <a href="https://bit.ly/cmfanalysis">this document for a detailed analysis and critique of the CMF</a>, but the bottom line is that rather than trying to elevate under-served students, <strong>such “reforms” reduce access and options for all students</strong>. In particular, the CMF encourages schools to stop offering Algebra I in middle school, while placing obstacles (such as doubling-up, compressed courses, or outside-of-school private courses) in the way of those who want to take advanced math in higher grades. When similar reforms were implemented in San Francisco, they <a href="https://edsource.org/2021/one-districts-faulty-data-shouldnt-drive-californias-math-policy/663374">resulted</a> in an <strong><em>“inequitable patchwork scheme”</em></strong> of workarounds that affluent students could access but that their less privileged counterparts could not. The CMF also promotes<strong> trendy and shallow courses</strong> (such as a nearly math-free version of  “data science”) as recommended alternatives  to<strong> foundational mathematical courses</strong> such as Algebra and Calculus. These courses do not prepare students <a href="https://bit.ly/cmfanalysis">even for careers in data science itself</a>!</p>



<p>As educators and practitioners, we have seen first-hand the value of solid foundations in mathematics for pursuing college-level STEM education and a productive STEM career. </p>



<p>While well-intentioned, <strong>we believe that many of the changes proposed by the CMF are deeply misguided and will disproportionately harm under-resourced students</strong>. Adopting them would result in a student population that is less prepared to succeed in STEM and other 4-year quantitative degrees in college.  The CMF <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/documents/mathfwchapter7.docx">states</a> that <strong><em>“many students, parents, and teachers encourage acceleration beginning in grade eight (or sooner) because of mistaken beliefs that Calculus is an important high school goal.”</em></strong> Students, parents, and teachers <strong><em>are not mistaken</em></strong>. Neither is the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), which set in 2015 a goal to double the number of African American students taking calculus by 2025. Calculus is not the only goal of K-12 math education, but it <em>is</em> important for students who wish to prepare for STEM in college and beyond. </p>



<p>We agree that calculus is not the “be-all and end-all” of high-school mathematics education. In particular, we encourage introducing options such as logic, probability, discrete mathematics, and algorithms design in the K-12 curriculum, as they can be valuable foundations for STEM education in college. However, when taught beyond a superficial level (which unfortunately is <em>not</em> the case in the CMF “data science” <a href="https://hsdatascience.youcubed.org/">proposals</a>), these topics are not any easier  than calculus. They require the same foundations of logic, algebra, and functions, and fluency with numbers and calculations. Indeed, the career paths with the highest potential for growth require <a href="https://pub.towardsai.net/the-era-of-the-mathematician-has-arrived-39ec20b24aa6">more and deeper mathematical preparation</a> than ever before. Calculus and other mathematical foundations are not important because they are admission requirements for colleges, or because they are relics of the <a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/math-curriculum/">“Sputnik era”</a>. They are important because they provide fundamental knowledge and ways of thinking that are necessary for success in these fast growing and in-demand fields.</p>



<p>We also fully support incorporating introductory data analysis and coding skills in the K-12 curriculum (and there are some <a href="https://coursekata.org/">good</a> <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/ap/2022/">approaches</a> for doing so).  But we strongly disagree with marketing such skills as replacing foundational skills in algebra and calculus when preparing for 4-year college degrees in STEM and other quantitative fields. These topics are important and build on basic math foundations but are not a replacement for such foundations any more than social media skills can replace reading and writing foundations. </p>



<p>Given the above, we, together with <strong>more than 150 scientists, educators, and practitioners in STEM</strong>, have signed an <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home"><strong>open letter expressing our concerns with such trends</strong></a>. The signatories include STEM faculty in public and private universities and practitioners from industry. They include educators with decades of experience teaching students at all levels, as well as researchers that won the highest awards in their fields, including the Fields Medal and the Turing Award. Signers also include people vested in mathematical high-school education, such as Adrian Mims (founder of <a href="http://thecalculusproject.org/">The Calculus Project</a>) and Jelani Nelson (UC Berkeley EECS professor and founder of <a href="https://www.addiscoder.com/">AddisCoder</a>) who have spearheaded projects to increase access to underserved populations.</p>



<p>We encourage you to read the letter, and if you are a US-based STEM professional or educator, consider signing it as well: <a href="https://bit.ly/mathedletter">https://bit.ly/mathedletter</a></p>



<p>Unfortunately, in recent years, debates on US education have become politicized. The letter is not affiliated with any political organization, and we believe that the issues we highlight transcend current political debates. After all, expanding access to mathematical education is both socially just and economically wise.</p>

<p><i>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01008">recent work</a>, we develop a framework for modifying the
behavior of a classifier by directly rewriting its internal prediction rules.
This allows a model designer to adapt the model to new setting or remove
specific spurious correlations with virtually no additional data collection or
further model training. </i></p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Modern machine learning classifiers work because they are able to extract
predictive correlations from large, relatively uncurated datasets. However, as
has been pointed out
<a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/torralba/research/bias/">re</a>-<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04975">pea</a>-<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06707">te</a>-<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09994">dly</a>,
many of these correlations are spurious or context-specific. That is, while
they are predictive on the training dataset, they need not necessarily be
predictive in the real-world settings where we wish to deploy our models. For
instance, a useful example to keep in mind throughout this post is that of
“cars on snow”: if a model relies on the presence of “road” to recognize a car
(because most cars in the training set are on the road) it might have trouble
recognizing cars when they drive through snow.</p>

<p>So, what can we do about that?</p>

<h2 id="editing-classifiers-setting-up-the-problem">Editing classifiers: Setting up the problem</h2>
<p>A natural idea is to modify the model after training, but how exactly would we
do that? The canonical method for modifying such a “buggy” ML model once it
has been trained is to collect additional data that captures the classifier’s
intended behavior and then use that data to fine-tune the model. However,
collecting such data might be tricky and/or expensive. More importantly, this
is an <em>indirect</em> process, i.e., we are specifying model behavior only through
training examples—which is what gave rise to undesired correlations in the
first place.</p>

<p>In order to develop a more reliable process, we want to allow a model designer
to <em>directly</em> edit model’s “inner mechanics”. In other words, we want the
designer to be able to specify <em>how</em> a model should predict on broad families
of inputs (and not just what it should predict on a specific, fixed set of
training inputs).</p>

<p>Conceptually, we can think of the model as operating based on some <em>prediction
rules</em>. For instance, “if grass is present, then this is likely an image of a
cow” or “if a wheel is present, this is likely an image of a car”. From that
perspective, our goal is to enable the designer to interact with these rules
and rewrite how these <em>concepts</em> (e.g., “car”, “wheel”) are associated with
each other. Crucially, we need for such rewrites to <em>generalize</em>, i.e., if one
modifies how the concept “wheel” is perceived by the model, then this
modification should apply to all instances containing a wheel.</p>

<h2 id="a-concrete-editing-methodology">A concrete editing methodology</h2>
<p>So, how do we turn this conceptual framework into an actual tool? Our
method—which we will describe now—builds on the recent work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15646">Bau et al.
2020</a> that developed a method for editing
generative models.</p>

<p><strong>Concepts as vectors.</strong> Our point of start is figuring out  a way to capture
high-level concepts via concrete objects that  we can manipulate. The object of
choice is latent vectors. Indeed, as it turns out, it is possible to find directions in
the latent representation of the model that capture different visual concepts (e.g.,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11279">TCAV</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05796">Network
Dissection</a>). Moreover, as Bau et al. found,
it is possible to find such directions based only on a few images. This can be
done by simply selecting the pixels corresponding to the desired concept and
then aggregating the latent representations of these pixels via PCA.</p>

<p><strong>Layers as associative memory.</strong> Next, we want to develop a way to modify how
the classifier processes these high-level concepts (captured by vectors). For
this, we view each layer of the network as a linear associative memory: i.e., a
mapping of each latent vector in its input (the key) to another latent vector in its
output—the value. From that perspective, if we have a vector $k$ capturing some
high-level concept in the latent representation space <em>before</em> some layer $L$,
and a vector $v$ capturing another concept <em>after</em> $L$, then we can modify the
weights $W$ of that layer to map one concept to another, i.e., have that</p>

\[v \simeq Wk.\]

<p>Importantly, to ensure that this update does not affect how other concepts are
being processed, we restrict it to only a rank-one change in the weights W. You
can find a more detailed description in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15646">original
paper</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Rewriting classifiers.</strong> With these primitives in place, we can focus our
attention on editing classifiers. How would we modify a model to recognize cars
on snow as it would if they were on the road? At a high-level, we need to
ensure that the model treats the concept of “snow” the same way it treats the
concept of “road”. To this end, we start from a picture of a car (on a road),
manually annotate the part that depicts “road”, and then replace this part by
copy-pasting a snow texture on it.</p>

<p>Now, fixing any layer $L$, we use the selected pixels to compute a “snow” vector
$k$ <em>before</em> that layer and a “road” vector $v$ <em>after</em> that layer. Then, in order
to perform our edit we simply update the weights of that layer so that it
(approximately) maps the vector $k$ to the vector $v$. And that’s it! We can leave
the rest of the model as-is, since the snowy part of the image will be
processed as if it depicted a road.</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/pipeline.png" style="width: 80%;" class="bigimg" /></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong> Editing methodology.</strong> We modify a
layer of the classifier so that the concept "snow" before the layer gets mapped
to "road" after the layer using a single synthetic example.</div>

<h2 id="does-editing-work">Does editing work?</h2>

<p>Let’s now try to apply this methodology to a couple of real world test cases.
In both cases, we will perform these updates based on a <em>single</em> exemplar that
we manually modified.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 1: Vehicles on snow.</strong> We start with our running example of
vehicles-on-snow. For that, we form a test set through searching
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> for images of “&lt;vehicle&gt; on snow” for a
number of different vehicles corresponding to ImageNet classes. We observe that
the performance of our ImageNet model on these new images is not great. Can we now
improve the model on this test set via a targeted edit?</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/snow_edit.png" style="width: 90%;" class="bigimg" /></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Adapting the model to snowy environments.</strong>
By mapping the concept "snow" to "road" we aim to improve the model's
ability to recognize vehicles driving through snow.</div>

<p>To check that, we form an exemplar by taking a picture of a “police van” (a
class that is not in our test set) on a road and replacing the road with a snow
texture. It turns out that by then  editing the model to map “snow” to “road”
using our method we can indeed improve the performance on our snowy test set!
Also, note that the vehicle in our exemplar belongs to a class that is not part
of the test set, so we can see that our edit generalized to other instances of
the concepts used.</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/snow_results.png" style="width: 80%;" class="bigimg" /></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Editing performance on vehicles-on-snow edits.</strong> 
Editing consistently improves model accuracy across classes. In contrast,
fine-tuning using the same data cannot correct any of the predictions.</div>

<p>It is worth contrasting this with the performance of fine-tuning, i.e., when we
simply fine-tune the whole model on this exemplar. There seems to be no
performance improvement in this case.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 2: Typographic-attacks.</strong> We then take a look at the recent
typographic attacks of <a href="https://distill.pub/2021/multimodal-neurons/">[Goh et al.,
2021]</a>: putting a handwritten “ipod” label on
different household objects causes a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020">CLIP</a>
classifier to classify them as iPods! Here is our reproduction:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/ipod.png" style="width: 80%;" class="bigimg" /></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Typographic attacks.</strong> 
Placing a handwritten note with the text "ipod" on various household objects
causes a CLIP-trained model to incorrectly predict "ipod".</div>

<p>Now, we will try to edit this classifier to make it ignore this misleading text
and thus predict the underlying object correctly. To do so, we start from an
unrelated image of a can opener and synthetically create two version of that
image: one where we paste an “ipod” label and one where we paste a blank label.
We then edit the model to map “ipod” to “blank” and we find that this corrects
the model predictions on all images, making the model impervious to this
typographic-attack!</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/ipod_edit.png" style="width: 90%;" class="bigimg" /></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Mitigating typographic attacks via editing.</strong> 
Mapping the text ipod to "blank" allows us to correct all model mistakes caused
by the misleading text, recovering the underlying object prediction.</div>

<p>In contrast, fine-tuning is not a reliable solution. While it can fix some
mistakes (potentially by adjusting class biases), it often causes the model to
incorrectly associate other objects with the fine-tuning label and/or decreases
model performance on actual ipod images.</p>

<h2 id="large-scale-synthetic-evaluation">Large-scale synthetic evaluation</h2>
<p>While the two examples that we looked at so far might be compelling, we want to
stress test our method on a wider variety of settings. Unfortunately, manually
identifying interesting scenarios and collecting the corresponding datasets is
a daunting task. We thus focus on creating <em>synthetic</em> editing test cases.</p>

<p>Specifically, we want to setup scenarios in which we transform a specific
concept (e.g., “wheel”) in a consistent manner across classes. This way, if the
editing process is successful, performing the edit using a few of these images
should significantly improve the performance of the model on other transformed
images.</p>

<p>To setup such scenarios in a scalable manner, we leverage a pipeline based on
pre-trained instance segmentation models and style transfer (we manually
collect a set of textures to use as styles).</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/synthetic.png" style="width: 90%;" class="bigimg" /></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Creating synthetic test cases.</strong> 
By leveraging pre-trained instance segmentation models and style transfer, we
can transform concepts in large existing datasets. This allows us to create
editing test cases in a scalable way.</div>

<p>With this pipeline in place, we evaluate editing across a wide range of
examples and measure how many of the errors caused by these transformations get
corrected. As a baseline, we compare ourselves to fine-tuning of either the
whole network, or of all the layers after the one that we perform editing on.</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/results.png" style="width: 95%;" class="bigimg" /></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Editing performance.</strong> Editing
consistently corrects the mistakes caused by the transformations we apply. In
fact, this is true even for classes that are different from the one used to
perform the edit. In contrast, fine-tuning does not generalize in the same way
and only corrects mistakes on images of the same class.</div>

<p>Looking at these results, we can observe that when measuring the impact of
editing and fine-tuning on images of the same class used during editing, both
methods perform reasonably well. However, when we focus on images of <em>other</em>
classes—which would reflect actual generalization—editing continues to
correct errors while fine-tuning often causes more errors than it fixes!</p>

<h2 id="beyond-editing-synthetic-test-cases-as-counterfactuals">Beyond editing: Synthetic test cases as counterfactuals</h2>
<p>While we developed the above pipeline with the goal of  benchmarking editing
methods in mind, it turns out to be useful more broadly. In fact, it
provides us with a scalable way to evaluate models on <em>counterfactuals</em>, i.e.,
to test how the model’s  prediction changes when a given concept of interest is
transformed. Such counterfactuals-based analysis can be used to get a
better understanding of which concepts are important for the model to recognize
each class as well as to reveal model sensitivities across classes.</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/analysis.png" style="width: 95%;" class="bigimg" /></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Counterfactual-based model analysis. </strong> 
Using the synthetic transformations we described we can analyze how model
predictions are sensitive to the presence of various objects.</div>

<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving forward</h2>
<p>In this post, we described a framework for directly editing classification
models. We saw how such editing can be a powerful and versatile primitive for
correcting model behavior with minimal data gathering and human labor.
However, we are still only starting to understand what is possible
through this framework. What other model edits would be useful to have?
How can we “localize” our edits so that they only apply to a specific context?
How do we edit multiple prediction rules at once?</p></div>

Comparator circuits are a natural circuit model for studying bounded fan-out computation whose power sits between nondeterministic branching programs and general circuits. Despite having been studied for nearly three decades, the first superlinear lower bound against comparator circuits was proved only recently by Gál and Robere (ITCS 2020), who established a $\Omega((n/\log n)^{1.5})$ lower bound on the size of comparator circuits computing an explicit function of $n$ bits. 

In this paper, we initiate the study of average-case complexity and circuit analysis algorithms for comparator circuits. Departing from previous approaches, we exploit the technique of shrinkage under random restrictions to obtain a variety of new results for this model. Among our results, we show 

- Average-case Lower Bounds. For every $k = k(n)$ with $k \geq \log n$, there exists a polynomial-time computable function $f_k$ on $n$ bits such that, for every comparator circuit $C$ with at most $n^{1.5}/O(k\cdot \sqrt{\log n})$ gates, we have 
 
\[ \text{Pr}_{x\in\left\{ 0,1 \right\}^n}\left[C(x)=f_k(x)\right]\leq \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2^{\Omega(k)}}. \]

This average-case lower bound matches the worst-case lower bound of Gál and Robere by letting $k=O(\log n)$. 

- #SAT Algorithms. There is an algorithm that counts the number of satisfying assignments of a given comparator circuit with at most $n^{1.5}/O\!\left(k\cdot \sqrt{\log n}\right)$ gates, in time $2^{n-k}\cdot\text{poly}(n)$, for any $k\leq n/4$. The running time is non-trivial when $k=\omega(\log n)$. 

- Pseudorandom Generators and MCSP Lower Bounds. There is a pseudorandom generator of seed length $s^{2/3+o(1)}$ that fools comparator circuits with $s$ gates. Also, using this PRG, we obtain an $n^{1.5-o(1)}$ lower bound for MCSP against comparator circuits.</div>
