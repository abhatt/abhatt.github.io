where each vertex of an $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ is assigned a
$(1+o(1))\log_2 n$-bit label and the labels of two vertices $u$ and $v$ are
sufficient to determine if $uv$ is an edge of $G$. This is optimal up to the
lower order term and is the first such asymptotically optimal result. An
alternative, but equivalent, interpretation of this result is that, for every
$n$, there exists a graph $U_n$ with $n^{1+o(1)}$ vertices such that every
$n$-vertex planar graph is an induced subgraph of $U_n$. These results
generalize to bounded genus graphs, apex-minor-free graphs, bounded-degree
graphs from minor closed families, and $k$-planar graphs.

clique-width. This unifies and extends previously known polynomial-time results
on several graph classes, and answers open questions posed by Campos and Silva
[Algorithmica, 2018] and Bonomo et al. [Graphs Combin., 2009]. This constitutes
the first result concerning structural parameterizations of this problem. We
show that the problem is FPT when parameterized by the vertex cover number on
general graphs, and on chordal graphs when parameterized by the number of
colors. Additionally, we observe that our algorithm for graphs of bounded
clique-width can be adapted to solve the Fall Coloring problem within the same
runtime bound.

The most
significant parameter of a trie is its height $H$ which equals the length of
the longest common prefix of any two string in the set $A$ over which the trie
is built. Analytical investigations of random tries suggest that ${\bf E}(H)\in
O(\log(\|A\|))$, although $H$ is unbounded in the worst case. Moreover, sharp
results on the distribution function of $H$ are known for many different random
string sources. But because of the inherent weakness of the modeling behind
average-case analysis---analyses being dominated by random data---these results
can utterly explain the fact that in many practical situations the trie height
is logarithmic. We propose a new semi-random string model and perform a
smoothed analysis in order to give a mathematically more rigorous explanation
for the practical findings. The perturbation functions which we consider are
based on probabilistic finite automata (PFA) and we show that the transition
probabilities of the representing PFA completely characterize the asymptotic
growth of the smoothed trie height. Our main result is of dichotomous
nature---logarithmic or unbounded---and is certainly not surprising at first
glance, but we also give quantitative upper and lower bounds, which are derived
using multivariate generating function in order to express the computations of
the perturbing PFA. A direct consequence is the logarithmic trie height for
edit perturbations(i.e., random insertions, deletions and substitutions).

generating a random integer from a discrete probability distribution using a
source of independent and unbiased random coin flips. We prove that this
algorithm, which we call the Fast Loaded Dice Roller (FLDR), is highly
efficient in both space and time: (i) the size of the sampler is guaranteed to
be linear in the number of bits needed to encode the input distribution; and
(ii) the expected number of bits of entropy it consumes per sample is at most 6
bits more than the information-theoretically optimal rate. We present fast
implementations of the linear-time preprocessing and near-optimal sampling
algorithms using unsigned integer arithmetic. Empirical evaluations on a broad
set of probability distributions establish that FLDR is 2x-10x faster in both
preprocessing and sampling than multiple baseline algorithms, including the
widely-used alias and interval samplers. It also uses up to 10000x less space
than the information-theoretically optimal sampler, at the expense of less than
1.5x runtime overhead.

implementations. Existing methods that synchronize simple sets are mainly based
on compact data structures such as Bloom filter and its variants. However,
these methods are infeasible to synchronize a pair of multisets which allow an
element to appear for multiple times. To this end, in this paper, we propose to
leverage the counting cuckoo filter (CCF), a novel variant of cuckoo filter, to
represent and thereafter synchronize a pair of multisets. The cuckoo filter
(CF) is a minimized hash table that uses cuckoo hashing to resolve collisions.
CF has an array of buckets, each of which has multiple slots to store element
fingerprints. Based on CF, CCF extends each slot as two fields, the fingerprint
field and the counter field. The fingerprint field records the fingerprint of
element which is stored by this slot; while the counter field counts the
multiplicity of the stored element. With such a design, CCF is competent to
represent any multiset. After generating and exchanging the respective CCFs
which represent the local multi-sets, we propose the query-based and the
decoding-based methods to identify the different elements between the given
multisets. The comprehensive evaluation results indicate that CCF outperforms
the counting Bloom filter (CBF) when they are used to synchronize multisets, in
terms of both synchronization accuracy and the space-efficiency, at the cost of
a little higher time-consumption.

algorithms for robot motion planning. The term ``complete'' indicates that an
approach is guaranteed to find the correct solution (a motion path or
trajectory in our setting), or to report that none exists otherwise (in case
that for instance, no feasible path exists). Complexity theory is a fundamental
tool in computer science for analyzing the performance of algorithms, in terms
of the amount of resources they require. (While complexity can express
different quantities such as space and communication effort, our focus in this
chapter is on time complexity.) Moreover, complexity theory helps to identify
``hard'' problems which require an excessive amount of computation time to
solve. In the context of motion planning, complexity theory can come in handy
in various ways, some of which are illustrated here.

Time Hypothesis of Impagliazzo and Paturi [CCC 1999] due to Dell et al. [ACM

nonzero coordinates. Moreover, we also show that the same is true for computing
the Tutte polynomial of a binary matroid of dimension $k$ on $k^{O(1)}$ points

results stand in sharp contrast to computing the Tutte polynomial of a
$k$-vertex graph (that is, the Tutte polynomial of a graphic matroid of

so that every vector has exactly two nonzero coordinates), which is known to be
computable in $2^k k^{O(1)}$ time [Bj\"orklund et al., FOCS 2008]. Our
lower-bound proofs proceed in three steps: (i) a classic connection due to
Crapo and Rota [1970] between the number of tuples of codewords of full support
and the Tutte polynomial of the matroid associated with the code; (ii) an
earlier-established \#ETH-hardness of counting the solutions to a bipartite
$(d,2)$-CSP on $n$ vertices in $d^{o(n)}$ time; and (iii) new embeddings of
such CSP instances as questions about codewords of full support in a linear
code. We complement these lower bounds with a matching upper-bound algorithm
design that computes the Tutte polynomial of a linear matroid of dimension $k$
on $k^{O(1)}$ points in $k^{O(k)}$ arithmetic operations in the base field.

We study the algorithmic problem of multiplying large matrices that are rectangular. We prove that the method that has been used to construct the fastest algorithms for rectangular matrix multiplication cannot give optimal algorithms. In fact, we prove a precise numerical barrier for this method. Our barrier improves the previously known barriers, both in the numerical sense, as well as in its generality. We prove our result using the asymptotic spectrum of tensors. More precisely, we crucially make use of two families of real tensor parameters with special algebraic properties: the quantum functionals and the support functionals. In particular, we prove that any lower bound on the dual exponent of matrix multiplication $\alpha$ via the big Coppersmith-Winograd tensors cannot exceed 0.625.</div>

<p>As the coronavirus epidemic advances in Italy with a 25-30% growth rate (meaning that the numbers are doubling every 3-4 days), and after two weeks of “lockdown-lite” in Northern Italy seems to have made no difference, the Italian government imposed on Sunday morning a stricter lockdown on the region of Lombardy and some cities outside the region including Venice. Several people have reached out to ask how things are going, so here is a brief recap. </p>
<p><span id="more-4322"></span></p>
<p>First of all, I would like to give a shoutout to Taiwan, which is currently the country that has done the <a href="https://www.zmescience.com/other/pieces/how-taiwan-managed-to-avoid-a-coronavirus-outbreak/">best job stopping an outbreak</a>. The Taiwanese have several things going for them: the SARS scare made the government plan for the next epidemic, instead of making it up as it would go along, and their preparedness was impressive. The plan focused on isolation, contact-tracing, and people being careful: kudos to the Taiwanese for how well they complied. From the little that I have learned about Taiwan after living there for two months a couple of years ago, the Taiwanese are not rule-followers the way the Swiss or the Singaporean can be. But if they bend or break rules, they do that after a lot of consideration for how this impacts others. Basically, people <i>care about strangers</i>, a disposition that helps a lot in controlling an epidemic (and which is not a big part of the Italian national mood).</p>
<p>But let’s talk about me. This is my mood right now:<br />
<img src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/self_isolate.png?w=584" alt="self_isolate" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4326" /></p>
<p>(Image credit: <a href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a> by Randall Munroe)</p>
<p>Since we are past isolation-and-contact-tracing, the main goal is to reduce person-to-person contact so that we can stop the exponential growth. For the past two weeks, besides the usual recommendations (do not kiss hello and goodbye, do not shake hands, wash hands frequently, do not touch your face) the government recommended keeping a one-meter distance from other people. There has been some inventive ways to keep going under these requirements. For example cinemas (in the regions in which they were not required to shut down) sold tickets for at most a third of the seats, asking people to leave two empty seats between any occupied seats. </p>
<p>Last Saturday, before the newest set of regulations were in place, I went out for a drink. The bar had cordoned off the counter area</p>
<p> <img src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/img_9383.jpg?w=584" alt="IMG_9383" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4328" /></p>
<p>They asked everybody who came in to seat down, at one of a few well-separated tables. Gloves-wearing servers took orders and brought some food (instead of the usual buffet). Once all tables were taken, a server stood outside preventing other people from coming in.</p>
<p>As we were drinking our aperitivi at a safe distance from each other, news began to leak of the new measures, which the government eventually announced at 2am Sunday morning. The leak suggested that Lombardy, Venice, and other places, would be included in the so-called <i>red zone</i>, which was a group of small towns that had been completely isolated for the past two weeks (nobody could go in and out except ambulances, trash collection trucks, and deliveries). In a development that might not have happened in Taiwan, a few hundred people rushed to train stations in Milan and Venice to flee South.</p>
<p>The actual regulations allowed travel in and out of the places affected by the new lockdown, but only for <i>demonstrated work or health reasons</i>. This is what the regulation said, but how would people prove their reason? The Italian genius for bureaucracy started cranking in the next few hours, and now, at train stations, people are required to sign an affidavit stating the existence of such a reason before boarding a train:</p>
<p><img src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/affidavit.jpeg?w=584" alt="affidavit" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4329" /></p>
<p>In the locked-down cities, all bars and restaurants have to close by 6pm, and all places where people may congregate (including churches, gyms, swimming pools, in addition to museums, schools and universities which were already closed) are closed all day. Even funeral and weddings are banned. Grocery stores will have to ensure that people stay within a meter of each other, making people wait outside and enter in small groups if necessary.</p>
<p>What about me? I am procrastinating on writing blog posts about online optimization and on reviewing papers for ICALP, I have started reading William Gibson’s latest novel <i>Agency</i> and watching the tv series <i>Pose</i>, and I am cooking every meal. Considering that I like to sleep and that I am spending a fair amount of time on the phone, I have got the whole day covered.</p>
<p>What is next? At this point in Lombardy about a person in 2,500, or 0.04% of the population, is infected, and we have run out of ICU beds. The rate of infection in Wuhan peaked at about 0.6% of the population, and this was well past the point at which they had run out of hospital beds in general. Hopefully, here we will peak well below that. On the other hand, left to its own devices, in the absence of any containment measures, I have seen estimates that the disease would peak a bit higher than a flu epidemic, at 20% or even 60% of the population.</p>
<p>So, find the Taiwanese in yourself, think about others, and wash those hands.</p></div>

<p>
Maryam Aliakbarpour and Sandeep Silwal are PhD students at MIT. They have a joint <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07324.pdf">paper</a> titled, “Testing Properties of Multiple Distributions with Few Samples.” Aliakbarpour is advised by Ronitt Rubinfeld. Silwal has a different advisor, Piotr Indyk. Could we test which advisor is better by sampling? Haha, not a chance…</p>
<p>
Today we will discuss this paper as an example of the power of computer science theory.</p>
<p>
Aliakbarpour and Silwal (AS) prove results on property testing, which is of course a long studied area in statistics, in mathematics, and in complexity theory. Many problems of property testing are open; many are very hard problems, and some are really impossible—such as distinguishing slight differences between distributions. With all due respect, the brilliance of their paper is not in solving open problems. Rather it is how they modify property testing in a novel manner. </p>
<p>
Their proofs are clever, are technically strong, but we feel more importantly is how they change the problems. That is, they show how to add a new constraint to property testing, where: </p>
<ol>
<li>
The constraint is reasonable and appears to be natural; <p></p>
</li><li>
The constraint is powerful and allows efficient algorithms where previously none were possible.
</li></ol>
<p>Let’s look at this more closely.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Opening a Closed Problem </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We all know about open problems and closed problems. There are however two kinds of closed problems: ones that have been settled and ones that have been proved impossible to settle. We also know that one can often take an open problem and define a meaningful subcase of it that can be solved. What may be less obvious is how one can do the same with the latter kind of closed problem.</p>
<p>
The work of AS is a perfect example of this phenomenon. They take a problem that is unsolvable and change it to one that is solvable. The details of their results are less important than their change to the underlying problem. One of the key insights throughout theory is that we often have made major progress by changing the ground rules. The AS work is a particularly clear case of this. </p>
<p></p><h2> The New Condition </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
AS call it the <i>structural condition</i>. They postulate a consistency type of condition on property testing. Suppose that one is interesting in testing whether or not a collection of slot-machines are fair. That is, are they set to cheat players or not? This is known to be hard to do with few tests. But after adding their new constraint it becomes quite efficient.</p>
<p>
Among some examples to convey their definition, they postulate a row of slot machines in a casino that are supposed to give the same distribution of prizes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{j}" class="latex" title="{j}" /> with known <em>fair</em> probabilities <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%28j%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q(j)}" class="latex" title="{q(j)}" />. As usual with property testing we want to distinguish between two hypotheses that are some distance apart: one that the machines conform to the fair distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" /> and an alternative hypothesis that each is far from fair. There are two relevant factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
We do not get to make many tests on one machine of our choosing. The best we can do is watch people try the machines. They may try different machines and so give only a few sample results per machine. <p></p>
</li><li>
There are cases of this situation 1 where although each machine is far from fair the joint distribution of a few samples cannot be told apart from fair. The authors mention a trivial case where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" /> is uniform and we get just one result from each machine, results all different from each other. These cannot be told apart. But there are less-trivial cases.
</li></ol>
<p>
Such situations are common with real-word data. The authors mention cases of medical data when one gets just one or a few blood readings from patients with disparate situational factors that can bias their samples. The joint effect of the biases may completely mask the systematic population tendency one is trying to test for. This is the setting in which the problem of distinguishing has been regarded as impossible, case closed. In the slot-machine example, Aliakbarpour and Silwal state their structural condition informally as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Our goal is to test whether all the machines were fair … or they are far from being fair. In this case, we can naturally assume that if the machines are unfair, the house will assign a lower probability to the expensive prizes, and higher probability to cheap ones. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Of course, the house <em>could</em> cheat players without cheating in this uniform manner. More subtle rigging of the machines in different ways could mask the lowered expectation. But what AS are saying is: <i>Provided the house cheats in this consistent manner, then they can be discovered quickly</i>. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Formal Definition and Proof Idea </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The formal definition is that each of the true source distributions is biased the same way in the same components as the expected (“fair”) distribution:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Definition 1</b> <em> A sequence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5E1%2C%5Cdots%2C+p%5Em%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p^1,\dots, p^m}" class="latex" title="{p^1,\dots, p^m}" /> of distributions on a discrete domain <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{[n]}" class="latex" title="{[n]}" /> obeys the structural condition relative to the distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" /> if there is a subset <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Csubset+%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A \subset [n]}" class="latex" title="{A \subset [n]}" /> such that for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi+%5Cin+%5Bm%5D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{i \in [m]}" class="latex" title="{i \in [m]}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj+%5Cin+%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{j \in [n]}" class="latex" title="{j \in [n]}" />: </em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D+p%5Ei%28j%29+%5Cgeq+q%28j%29+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+j+%5Cin+A%5C%5C+p%5Ei%28j%29+%5Cleq+q%28j%29+%26+%5Ctext%7Botherwise%7D.+%5Cend%7Bcases%7D+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \begin{cases} p^i(j) \geq q(j) &amp; \text{if } j \in A\\ p^i(j) \leq q(j) &amp; \text{otherwise}. \end{cases} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \begin{cases} p^i(j) \geq q(j) &amp; \text{if } j \in A\\ p^i(j) \leq q(j) &amp; \text{otherwise}. \end{cases} " /></p>
</em><p><em></em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The term “structural condition” is vanilla and perhaps saying the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5Ei%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p^i}" class="latex" title="{p^i}" /> are “conformally biased” relative to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" /> would be more descriptive. A major point which the authors emphasize right afterward is that the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> is <em>unknown</em>. There are exponentially many possibilities for what <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> could be—so we cannot try to guess it. Rather, proofs using this condition need to exploit how all the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5E%7Bi%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p^{i}}" class="latex" title="{p^{i}}" /> distributions conform to the same <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />. The slot-machine example arguably does not reflect this point in full—because we can know in advance what the major and minor prizes of a slot machine are (including “no prize” among the latter). The medical-data examples and others certainly do, however.</p>
<p>
We can convey briefly and intuitively how this condition is used for the case where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" /> is uniform distribution on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{[n]}" class="latex" title="{[n]}" />—which is quite general as testing for many distributions can be efficiently mapped into this case. A key property of uniform distribution is that among all distributions on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{[n]}" class="latex" title="{[n]}" />, it minimizes the probability of getting <em>collisions</em> from repeated samples. This idea has yielded the most effective test statistics for problems when there is only one distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" />. When there are multiple <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5Ei%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p^i}" class="latex" title="{p^i}" /> the effectiveness can be blunted in instances like the one in the previous section—the instances that are impossible. </p>
<p>
However, AS show that their structural condition is just what’s needed to bridge the gap that keeps the impossible cases from being distinguished. Realizing that the compounded complications of having multiple <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5Ei%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p^i}" class="latex" title="{p^i}" /> can be resolved by this stroke is their act of brilliance. Their paper applies it successfully to two other problem settings—identity testing and closeness testing—and also shows meaningful instances that obey and are resolved by their definition but that escape an older condition involving product distributions. As usual, we say to see the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07324.pdf">paper</a> for the details.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Consequences in Crypto and Inference? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
It remains our place to ask, in which other cases might the AS condition arise and what uses might it have? I can think first of one implication for adversarial strategies in cryptography. It goes like this:</p>
<p>
We can view the AS theorems as saying that anyone who wishes to cheat others should <b>not</b> be consistent. Being consistent according to some utility criterion—<em>even an unknown one</em>—makes it easier for others to detect that they are cheating. </p>
<p>
Following their slot-machine example suggests this: Arrange the machines in total to cheat players. But make it so that they are not consistent. They can set some prizes up in probability and some lower, and importantly, do this differently on different machines. They could even make some machines pay out more than the legal expectation—while still giving a small profit to the casino so it does not become too obvious to customers that those machines are “lucky.” There is safety in non-conformity alone. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5CS+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \S " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \S " /></p>
<p>
Ken notices a similarity to the chess-modeling situation he began describing in this recent <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/11/29/predicating-predictivity/">post</a>. Instead of prizes of known value, in chess we have distributions over possible moves whose values are <em>not</em> so readily apparent to the player—that’s what makes chess challenging to play. </p>
<p>
In his case, giving any chess position <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> and a player <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> having that position, he postulates a true distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p^t}" class="latex" title="{p^t}" /> of moves <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> would make and wants to compare that with the distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q^t}" class="latex" title="{q^t}" /> projected by his model. Now there can be many positions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> with different characteristics, but Ken can treat the distributions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q^t}" class="latex" title="{q^t}" /> coming from his model as one fixed point of reference <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" />, and he can give different positions the same ranks of legal moves <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" /> (best), then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%2C%5Cdots%2C+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2,\dots, n}" class="latex" title="{2,\dots, n}" />. If positions have different numbers of legal moves he can pad them out by treating illegal moves the same as completely losing blunders. </p>
<p>
So he has a situation like this: different <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p^t}" class="latex" title="{p^t}" /> and one <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" /> over a bunch of positions. Ken knows his model not only varies in accuracy but is biased in ways explained in that post. It appears that this bias is highly conformal. The model is trained to make the projection <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q(1)}" class="latex" title="{q(1)}" /> of the probability of the first move accurate on average. Then the tendency is that the projections of the second-best and third-best moves are off one way, and the projections of all the other moves are off the other way. This is like having <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%3D+%5C%7B2%2C3%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A = \{2,3\}}" class="latex" title="{A = \{2,3\}}" /> or its complement most of the time. The new statistical tests that Ken is crafting also live under the specter of impossibility. A co-worker has demonstrated that they <em>fail</em> in cases randomly generated from normal distributions. But so far they are appearing to succeed in Ken’s more-structured situations from his real-world chess data. On this we will stay tuned.</p>

one-dimensional space is growing. Remarkable examples of these networks are
syntactic dependency trees and RNA structures. In this setup, the vertices of
the network are arranged linearly and then edges may cross when drawn above the
sequence of vertices. Recently, two aspects of the distribution of the number
of crossings in uniformly random linear arrangements have been investigated:
the expectation and the variance. While the computation of the expectation is
straightforward, that of the variance is not. Here we present fast algorithms
to calculate that variance in arbitrary graphs and forests. As for the latter,
the algorithm calculates variance in linear time with respect to the number of
vertices. This paves the way for many applications that rely on an exact but
fast calculation of that variance. These algorithms are based on novel
arithmetic expressions for the calculation of the variance that we develop from
previous theoretical work.

its internal vertices have distinct colors. The graph is rainbow
vertex-connected if there is a rainbow vertex path between every pair of its
vertices. In the Rainbow Vertex Coloring (RVC) problem we want to decide
whether the vertices of a given graph can be colored with at most $k$ colors so
that the graph becomes rainbow vertex-connected. This problem is known to be
NP-complete even in very restricted scenarios, and very few efficient
algorithms are known for it. In this work, we give polynomial-time algorithms
for RVC on permutation graphs, powers of trees and split strongly chordal
graphs. The algorithm for the latter class also works for the strong variant of
the problem, where the rainbow vertex paths between each vertex pair must be
shortest paths. We complement the latter result by showing that, for any fixed
$p\geq 3$ the problem becomes NP-complete when restricted to split
$(S_3,\ldots,S_p)$-free graphs, where $S_q$ denotes the $q$-sun graph.

in the Congested Clique model of distributed computing. We obtain
$poly(\log\log n)$-round algorithms for the following problems in unweighted
undirected $n$-vertex graphs:
</p>
<p>-- $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation of multi-source shortest paths (MSSP) from
$O(\sqrt{n})$ sources.
</p>
<p>-- $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation of all pairs shortest paths (APSP).
</p>
<p>-- $(1+\epsilon,\beta)$-approximation of APSP where $\beta=O(\frac{\log\log
n}{\epsilon})^{\log\log n}$.
</p>
<p>These bounds improve exponentially over the state-of-the-art poly-logarithmic
bounds due to [Censor-Hillel et al., PODC19]. It also provides the first
nearly-additive bounds for the APSP problem in sub-polynomial time. Our
approach is based on distinguishing between short and long distances based on
some distance threshold $t = O(\frac{\beta}{\epsilon})$ where
$\beta=O(\frac{\log\log n}{\epsilon})^{\log\log n}$. Handling the long
distances is done by devising a new algorithm for computing sparse
$(1+\epsilon,\beta)$ emulator with $O(n\log\log n)$ edges. For the short
distances, we provide distance-sensitive variants for the distance tool-kit of
[Censor-Hillel et al., PODC19]. By exploiting the fact that this tool-kit
should be applied only on local balls of radius $t$, their round complexities
get improved from $poly(\log n)$ to $poly(\log t)$.
</p>
<p>Finally, our deterministic solutions for these problems are based on a
derandomization scheme of a novel variant of the hitting set problem, which
might be of independent interest.

and high-dimensional datasets. Traditionally, similarity search has focused on
discovering very similar pairs, for which a variety of efficient algorithms are
known. However, recent work highlights the importance of finding pairs of sets
with relatively small intersection sizes. For example, in a recommender system,
two users may be alike even though their interests only overlap on a small
percentage of items. In such systems, some dimensions are often highly skewed
because they are very popular. Together these two properties render previous
approaches infeasible for large input sizes. To address this problem, we
present a new distributed algorithm, LSF-Join, for approximate all-pairs set
similarity. The core of our algorithm is a randomized selection procedure based
on Locality Sensitive Filtering. Our method deviates from prior approximate
algorithms, which are based on Locality Sensitive Hashing. Theoretically, we
show that LSF-Join efficiently finds most close pairs, even for small
similarity thresholds and for skewed input sets. We prove guarantees on the
communication, work, and maximum load of LSF-Join, and we also experimentally
demonstrate its accuracy on multiple graphs.

effectively deciding whether a quiver representation is semi-stable (in the
sense of Geometric Invariant Theory) and, in case it is not, finding a
subrepresentation certifying in an optimal way that the representation is not
semi-stable. In this paper, we show that SRSR and the more general quiver
semi-stability problem can be solved effectively.

<p>There are many more I could include, but haven’t yet (including most of the <em>Aperiodical</em> list). Many of these books are award-winners, but to a large extent inclusion in this list is driven by my personal taste in books, so many of these are somewhat specialized rather than being general-audience books. But the main criterion for inclusion on Wikipedia is that everything must have multiple in-depth sources, and everything in the article must come from those sources. For books those sources are not the book itself, but (typically) published book reviews. The bare minimum is two reviews, but I’ve been aiming for books with at least four. So for instance I would have liked to include <em>Geometry: The Line and the Circle</em> (2019), by Maureen T. Carroll and Elyn Rykken, but I could find only <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/geometry-the-line-and-the-circle">one review of it</a>, and that’s not enough. To all the book reviewers out there: your efforts are appreciated, and helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Monotone probability distributions over the Boolean cube can be learned with sublinear samples</strong>, by Ronitt Rubinfeld and Arsen Vasilyan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03415">arXiv</a>). By now, it is well known that assuming an (unknown) distribution enjoys some sort of structure can lead to more efficient algorithms for learning and testing. Often one proves that the structure permits a convenient representation, and exploits this representation to solve the problem at hand. This paper studies the learning of monotone distributions over the Boolean hypercube. The authors exploit and extend a structural statement about monotone Boolean <em>functions</em> by <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-43948-7_20">Blais, Håstad, Servedio, and Tan</a>, using it to provide sublinear algorithms for estimating the support size, distance to uniformity, and the distribution itself.</p>

Given a collection of \(k\) distributions and a set of samples from one of them, can we identify which distribution it is? This paper studies this problem (and an agnostic generalization of it) under the constraint of <em>local differential privacy</em>. The authors show that this problem requires \(\Omega(k)\) samples, in contrast to the \(O(\log k)\) complexity in the non-private model. Furthermore, they give \(\tilde O(k)\)-sample upper bounds in various interactivity models.</p>



<p><strong>Efficient Distance Approximation for Structured High-Dimensional Distributions via Learning</strong>, by Arnab Bhattacharyya, Sutanu Gayen, Kuldeep S. Meel, and N. V. Vinodchandran (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05378">arXiv</a>). Given samples from two distributions, can you estimate the total variation distance between them? This paper gives a framework for solving this problem for <em>structured</em> distribution classes, including Ising models, Bayesian networks, Gaussians, and causal models. The approach can be decomposed properly learning the distributions, followed by estimating the distance between the two hypotheses. Challenges arise when densities are hard to compute exactly.</p></div>

<p>Many people have suggested coating handles, doorknobs and so forth with <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LwcKYR8bykM6vDHyo/coronavirus-justified-practical-advice-thread">virus-killing copper tape</a>.  It’s a shame that this isn’t being tried on a wider scale.  In the meantime, though, here’s a related but different idea that I had last night.</p>



<p>Imagine we could coat every doorknob, every light switch, every railing, every other surface that people might touch in public buildings, with some long-lasting disgusting, sticky, slimy substance.  For a variety of reasons, one probably wouldn’t use actual excrement, although it wouldn’t hurt if the substance <em>looked like</em> that.  Or it could be a sickly neon green or red, to make it impossible to conceal when you’d gotten the substance on your hands.</p>



<p>What would be the result?  Of course, people would avoid touching these surfaces.  If they had to, they’d do so with a napkin or glove whenever possible.  If they had to touch them bare-handedly, they’d rush to wash their hands with soap as soon as possible afterwards.  Certainly they wouldn’t touch their faces before having washed their hands.</p>



<p>In short, they’d show exactly the behaviors that experts agree are among the most helpful, if our goal is to slow the spread of the coronavirus.  In effect, we’d be plugging an unfortunate gap in our evolutionary programming—namely, that the surfaces where viruses can thrive aren’t intuitively disgusting to us, as (say) vomit or putrid meat are—by <em>making</em> those surfaces disgusting, as they ought to be in the middle of a pandemic.</p>



<p>Note that, even if it <em>somehow</em> turns out to be infeasible to coat all the touchable surfaces in public buildings with disgusting goo, you might still derive great personal benefit from <em>imagining</em> them so covered.  If you manage to pull that off, it will yield just the right heuristic for when and how often you should now be washing your hands (and avoiding touching your face), without no need for additional conscious reflection.</p>



<p>Mostly, having the above thoughts made me grateful for my friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hanson">Robin Hanson</a>.  For as long Robin is around, <a href="https://twitter.com/robinhanson/status/1235020994110205953">tweeting</a> and <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/02/consider-controlled-infection.html">blogging</a> from his unique corner of mindspace, no one will ever be able to say that <em>my</em> ideas for how to control the coronavirus were the world’s weirdest or most politically tone-deaf.</p></div>

Motivated by problems in algebraic complexity theory (e.g., matrix multiplication) and extremal combinatorics (e.g., the cap set problem and the sunflower problem), we introduce the geometric rank as a new tool in the study of tensors and hypergraphs. We prove that the geometric rank is an upper bound on the subrank of tensors and the independence number of hypergraphs. We prove that the geometric rank is smaller than the slice rank of Tao, and relate geometric rank to the analytic rank of Gowers and Wolf in an asymptotic fashion. As a first application, we use geometric rank to prove a tight upper bound on the (border) subrank of the matrix multiplication tensors, matching Strassen's well-known lower bound from 1987.</div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>Several people asked me to comment on the recent announcement by Honeywell that they’ll soon have what they call “the most powerful” quantum computer (see <a href="https://www.honeywell.com/en-us/newsroom/news/2020/03/behind-the-scenes-of-a-major-quantum-breakthrough">here for press release</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2020/03/03/honeywell-surprisingly-announces-it-will-be-releasing-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-in-the-world/#c271c5114b4a">here for <em>Forbes</em> article</a>, <a href="https://www.honeywell.com/content/dam/honeywell/files/Beta_10_Quantum_3_3_2020.pdf">here for paper</a>).  </p>



<p>I’m glad that Honeywell, which many people might know as an air-conditioner manufacturer, has entered the race for trapped-ion QC.  I wish them success.  I’ve known about what they were doing in part because Drew Potter, my friend and colleague in UT Austin’s physics department, took a one-year leave from UT to contribute to their effort.</p>



<p>Here I wanted to comment about one detail in Honeywell’s announcement: namely, the huge emphasis on “quantum volume” as the central metric for judging quantum computing progress, and the basis for calling their own planned device the “most powerful.”  One journalist asked me to explain why quantum volume is such an important measure.  I had to give her an honest answer: I don’t know whether it is.</p>



<p>Quantum volume was invented a few years ago by a group at IBM.  According to one of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12926.pdf">their papers</a>, it can be defined roughly as 2<sup>k</sup>, where k is the largest number such that you can run a k-qubit random quantum circuit, with depth k and with any-to-any connectivity, and have at least (say) 2/3 probability of measuring an answer that passes some statistical test.  (In the paper, they use what Lijie Chen and I named <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05903">Heavy Output Generation</a>, though Google’s Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark is similar.)</p>



<p>I don’t know why IBM takes the “volume” to be 2<sup>k</sup> rather than k itself.  Leaving that aside, though, the idea was to invent a single “goodness measure” for quantum computers that can’t be gamed <em>either</em> by building a huge number of qubits that don’t maintain nearly enough coherence (what one might call “the D-Wave approach”), <em>or</em> by building just one perfect qubit, <em>or</em> by building qubits that behave well in isolation but don’t interact easily.  Note that the any-to-any connectivity requirement makes things harder for architectures with nearest-neighbor interactions only, like the 2D superconducting chips being built by Google, Rigetti, or IBM itself.</p>



<p>You know the notion of a researcher’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index">h-index</a>—defined as the largest h such that she’s published h papers that garnered h citations each?  Quantum volume is basically an h-index for quantum computers.  It’s an attempt to take several different yardsticks of experimental progress, none terribly useful in isolation, and combine them into one “consumer index.”</p>



<p>Certainly I sympathize with the goal of broadening people’s focus beyond the “but how many qubits does it have?” question—since the answer to that question is meaningless without further information about what the qubits can <em>do</em>.  From that standpoint, quantum volume seems like a clear step in the right direction.</p>



<p>Alas, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart’s Law</a> states that “as soon as a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”  That happened years ago with the h-index, which now regularly pollutes academic hiring and promotion decisions, to the point where <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09496">its inventor expressed regrets</a>.  Quantum volume is now looking to me like another example of Goodhart’s Law at work.</p>



<p>The position of Honeywell’s PR seems to be that, if they can build a device that can apply 6 layers of gates to 6 qubits, with full connectivity and good fidelity, that will then count as “the world’s most powerful quantum computer,” since it will have the largest volume.  One problem here is that such a device could be simulated by maintaining a vector of only 2<sup>6</sup>=64 amplitudes.  This is nowhere near quantum supremacy (i.e., beating classical computers at some well-defined task), which is a necessary though not sufficient condition for doing anything useful.</p>



<p>Think of a university that achieves an average faculty-to-student ratio of infinity by holding one class with zero students.  It gets the “best score” only by exploiting an obvious defect in the scoring system.</p>



<p>So what’s the alternative?  The policy <em>I</em> prefer is simply to tell the world all your system specs, as clearly as you can, with no attempts made to bury the lede.  How many qubits do you have?  With what coherence times?  With what connectivity?  What are the 1- and 2-qubit gate fidelities?  What depth of circuit can you do?  What resources do the standard classical algorithms need to simulate your system?  Most importantly: what’s the main drawback of your system, the spec that’s the <em>worst</em>, the one you most need to improve?  What prevents you from having a scalable quantum computer right now?  And are you going to tell me, or will you make me scour Appendix III.B in your paper, or worse yet, ask one of your competitors?</p>



<p>I confess that the answers to the above questions are hard to summarize in a single number (unless you, like, concatenated binary encodings of them or something).  But they <em>can</em> be ineffably combined, to produce a progress metric that one of my postdocs suggested calling “quantum scottness,” and which roughly equals the number of expressions of wide-eyed surprise minus the number of groans.</p></div>

In 1890, Chicago South Side pastor Frank Gunsaulus gave a sermon where he said that with a million dollars he could build a school where students of all backgrounds could prepare for meaningful roles in a changing industrial society. One of the congregants, Philip Armour, came up to him after the service and told Gunsaulus that "if you give me five years of your time, I will give you the money." Thus was born the Armour Institute of Technology, the forerunner of the Illinois Institute of Technology.<br />
<br />
Today Illinois Tech enters a new chapter, <a href="https://www.iit.edu/news/illinois-tech-creates-college-computing-fuel-chicagos-tech-rise">announcing a College of Computing</a>, and I am honored to have been asked to serve as its inaugural dean. The college will take on a horizontal mission, to infuse computation and data science thinking throughout the curriculum in every discipline, while understanding the power, limitations and social implications of the technologies they create. We will significantly grow computing to produce the talent needed for a growing Chicago tech community. The college will develop an agile curriculum to continually reevaluate our offerings as computing technology continues to advance, and develop education as a life-long process where our alumni can always count on Illinois Tech to continually reskill to advance their careers.<br />
<br />
We will do it all by keeping the core principle of the original "million-dollar sermon," as important as ever, to prepare students of all backgrounds for meaningful roles in a changing technological society.<br />

<blockquote><p>Abstract: We provide an information-theoretic framework for studying the generalization properties of machine learning algorithms. Our framework ties together existing approaches, including uniform convergence bounds and recent methods for adaptive data analysis. Specifically, we use Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) to quantify how well the input (i.e., the training data) can be recognized given the output (i.e., the trained model) of the learning algorithm. We show that bounds on CMI can be obtained from VC dimension, compression schemes, differential privacy, and other methods. We then show that bounded CMI implies various forms of generalization.</p>

<p>These next few months, every time I stop myself from touching my face by force of will,</p>



<p>Let me remind myself that the same willpower is available to diet, to exercise, to throw myself into a project, to keep calm amid screaming, to introduce myself to strangers, to decrease the fraction of my life spent getting upset that someone was mean to my ingroup on social media, or otherwise to better myself as a human specimen.</p>



<p>Yea, let all of these things be just as easy for me as it was not to touch my face.</p>



<p>Ah, but what if I forget, what if I do keep touching my face in the next few months?</p>



<p>In one plausible scenario, with at least ~0.1% probability and probably higher depending on my age, a cheap answer will be available to that question: namely, that I’ll no longer be around to ponder the implications.</p></div>

(As many others have pointed out, this last might actually be a boon to scientific productivity—as it was for a young Isaac Newton when Cambridge was closed for the bubonic plague, so Newton went home and invented calculus and mechanics.)</p>



<p>Anyway, before that all happens, I figured I’d get in a last post about quantum information and complexity theory progress.</p>



<p>Hsin-Yuan Huang, Richard Kueng, and John Preskill have a nice preprint entitled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08953">Predicting Many Properties of a Quantum System from Very Few Measurements</a>.  In it they take <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01053">shadow tomography</a>, which I proposed a couple years ago, and try to bring it closer to practicality on near-term devices, by restricting to the special case of non-adaptive, one-shot measurements, on separate copies of the state ρ that you’re trying to learn about.  They show that this is possible using a number of copies that depends logarithmically on the number of properties you’re trying to learn (the optimal dependence), not at all on the Hilbert space dimension, and linearly on a new “shadow norm” quantity that they introduce.</p>



<p>Rahul Ilango, Bruno Loff, and Igor Oliveira announced the pretty spectacular-sounding result that the <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/021/">Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) is NP-complete for multi-output functions</a>—that is, for Boolean functions f with not only many input bits but many outputs.  Given the 2<sup>n</sup>-sized truth table of a Boolean function f:{0,1}<sup>n</sup>→{0,1}, the original MCSP simply asks for the size of the smallest Boolean circuit that computes f.  This problem was studied in the USSR as early as the 1950s; whether it’s NP-complete has stood for decades as one of the big open problems of complexity theory.  We’ve known that if you could quickly solve MCSP then you could also invert any one-way function, but we’ve also known technical barriers to going beyond that to a flat-out NP-hardness result, at least via known routes.  Before seeing this paper, I’d never thought about whether MCSP for many-output functions might somehow be easier to classify, but apparently it is!</p>



<p>Hamoon Mousavi, Seyed Nezhadi, and Henry Yuen have now taken the MIP*=RE breakthrough even a tiny step further, by showing that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10490">“zero-gap MIP*”</a> (that is, quantum multi-prover interactive proofs with an arbitrarily small gap between the completeness and soundness probabilities) takes you <strong>even beyond the halting problem</strong> (i.e., beyond Recursively Enumerable or RE), and up to the second level of the arithmetical hierarchy (i.e., to the halting problem for Turing machines with oracles for the original halting problem).  This answers a question that someone asked <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4512#comment-1829033">in the comments section of this blog</a>.</p>



<p>Several people asked me for comment on the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07730">What limits the simulation of quantum computers?</a>, by Yiqing Zhou, Miles Stoudenmire, and Xavier Waintal.  In particular, does this paper refute or weaken Google’s quantum supremacy claim, as the paper does <em>not</em> claim to do (but, rather coyly, also does not claim <em>not</em> to do)?  Short answer: No, it doesn’t, or not now anyway.</p>



<p>Longer, more technical answer: The quoted simulation times, just a few minutes for quantum circuits with 54 qubits and depth 20, <em>assume Controlled-Z gates rather than iSWAP-like gates.</em> Using tensor network methods, the classical simulation cost with the former is roughly the square root of the simulation cost with the latter (~2<sup>k</sup> versus ~4<sup>k</sup> for some parameter k related to the depth).  As it happens, Google switched its hardware from Controlled-Z to iSWAP-like gates a couple years ago precisely because they realized this—I had a conversation about it with Sergio Boixo at the time.  Once this issue is accounted for, the quoted simulation times in the new paper seem to be roughly in line with what was previously reported by, e.g., Johnnie Gray and Google itself.</p>



<p>Oh yeah, I enjoyed <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09524">Quantum Homeopathy Works</a>.  Cool result, and the title is actually a pretty accurate description of the contents.</p>



<p>To end with a community announcement: as many of you might know, the American Physical Society’s March Meeting, which was planned for this week in Denver, was abruptly cancelled due to the coronavirus (leaving thousands of physicists out their flights and hotel rooms—many had even already arrived there).  However, my colleague Michael Biercuk kindly alerted me to a <a href="https://virtualmarchmeeting.com/">“virtual March Meeting”</a> that’s been set up online, with recorded talks and live webinars.  Even after the pandemic passes, is this a model that we should increasingly move to?  I wouldn’t have thought so ten or fifteen years ago, but today every schlep across the continent brings me a step closer to shouting “yes”…</p></div>

Freeman Dyson passed away last February 28th, one day short of the leap day, February 29th. He was one of the great physicists, one of the great writers about science, and one of the great thinkers of all time. He is missed.</p>
<p>
Today we wish to discuss a tiny part of Dyson’s contributions to mathematics—and ask whether it has been developed further. </p>
<p><span id="more-16757"></span></p>
<p>
Dyson did so much in so many areas of science that we will leave it to others to discuss it. We covered a puzzle of his years ago <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/09/09/a-challenge-from-dyson/">here</a>. He famously showed that quantum electrodynamics (QED) is a consistent theory—in particular showing that different theories connecting quantum mechanics and special relativity were the same. He published many interesting books about science in general. He speculated about aliens, about space travel, and much more.</p>
<p>
Our focus is on a beautiful result of his proved in 1947. A result about rational numbers. Nothing grandiose, nothing about infinite visions, nothing about worlds that we cannot easily imagine. </p>

<p></p><p>
For over 2000 years we have known that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sqrt{2}}" class="latex" title="{\sqrt{2}}" /> is not expressible as a rational fraction. This is sometimes credited to Hippasus of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippasus">Metapontum</a>. The obvious question, at least to math types, is how close can we make it to a rational number? The answer is interesting, with many consequences. And includes some top mathematicians such as Johann Dirichlet, Joseph Liouville, Axel Thue, Carl Siegel, Dyson, and Klaus Roth.</p>

Note that the last result is best possible in the sense that Dirichlet achieved <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv+%3D+D+%3D+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{v = D = 2}" class="latex" title="{v = D = 2}" />, although slightly stronger statements than Roth can be made by using logarithms.</p>

To illustrate these formulas, Liouville proved that the following number is transcendental:</p>

Note that the exponent in Liouville’s number grows as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%21+%5Capprox+%5Cexp%28k%5Clog+k%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k! \approx \exp(k\log k)}" class="latex" title="{k! \approx \exp(k\log k)}" />.

For instance, </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bk%3D1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B10%5E%7B2%5Ek%7D%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{10^{2^k}} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{10^{2^k}} " /></p>

<p></p><h2> A Key Lemma </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What we wish to highlight from Dyson’s 1947 <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.acta/1485888462">paper</a> is the main lemma for his proof. He called it the key new idea in his paper and also said it might have independent interest. We agree, and we abstract some of its statement into the following definitions. </p>
<p>
Suppose we have a polynomial <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f(x,y)}" class="latex" title="{f(x,y)}" />. Call a point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28x_0%2Cy_0%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(x_0,y_0)}" class="latex" title="{(x_0,y_0)}" /> a <em>zero of order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28p%2Cq%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(p,q)}" class="latex" title="{(p,q)}" /></em> if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0+%5Cleq+m+%5Cleq+p%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0 \leq m \leq p}" class="latex" title="{0 \leq m \leq p}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0+%5Cleq+n+%5Cleq+q%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0 \leq n \leq q}" class="latex" title="{0 \leq n \leq q}" /> implies </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%5Em%7D%7B%5Cpartial+x%7D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%5En%7D%7B%5Cpartial+y%7Df%28x+%3D+x_0%2C+y+%3D+y_0%29+%3D+0.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \frac{\partial^m}{\partial x} \frac{\partial^n}{\partial y}f(x = x_0, y = y_0) = 0. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \frac{\partial^m}{\partial x} \frac{\partial^n}{\partial y}f(x = x_0, y = y_0) = 0. " /></p>
<p>Since this includes the case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm+%3D+n+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m = n = 0}" class="latex" title="{m = n = 0}" />, the point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28x_0%2Cy_0%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(x_0,y_0)}" class="latex" title="{(x_0,y_0)}" /> must be a zero of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f(x,y)}" class="latex" title="{f(x,y)}" /> as well as of all the partial derivatives. For example, when </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+xy+-+x+-+y+%2B+1%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  f(x,y) = xy - x - y + 1, " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  f(x,y) = xy - x - y + 1, " /></p>
<p>the point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%281%2C1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(1,1)}" class="latex" title="{(1,1)}" /> is a zero of order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%281%2C0%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(1,0)}" class="latex" title="{(1,0)}" /> and of order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%280%2C1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(0,1)}" class="latex" title="{(0,1)}" /> but not of order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%281%2C1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(1,1)}" class="latex" title="{(1,1)}" />. The diagonal-step nature of this example plays into the next definition. We follow Dyson in numbering from zero.</p>

</p><p></p><h2> Interpretation and Application </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Dyson supplied the following interpretation in his paper. The left-hand side of (<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#bound">1</a>) approximately counts the number of zeroes in the staircase—approximately because <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\lambda}" class="latex" title="{\lambda}" /> is left as a real number. We want a good upper bound on this number</p>
<p>
A polynomial <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f(x,y)}" class="latex" title="{f(x,y)}" /> of degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{u}" class="latex" title="{u}" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{s}" class="latex" title="{s}" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> may have up to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28u%2B1%29%28s%2B1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(u+1)(s+1)}" class="latex" title="{(u+1)(s+1)}" /> non-zero coefficieints. Thus <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28u%2B1%29%28s%2B1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(u+1)(s+1)}" class="latex" title="{(u+1)(s+1)}" /> is intuitively the maximum number of zeroes that could be arranged “on purpose” by the choice of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f}" class="latex" title="{f}" />. </p>
<p>
We want to minimize the number af additional zeroes that could exist. Lemma <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#key">2</a> says that this is limited by the factor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%281+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Dr%28r%2B1%29%5Cdelta%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(1 + \frac{1}{2}r(r+1)\delta)}" class="latex" title="{(1 + \frac{1}{2}r(r+1)\delta)}" />. We want to make this factor approach <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />. We can do so by making <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta}" class="latex" title="{\delta}" /> arbitrarily small. By the condition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda+%3E+%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B%5Cdelta%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\lambda &gt; \frac{2}{\delta}}" class="latex" title="{\lambda &gt; \frac{2}{\delta}}" /> this entails choosing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\lambda}" class="latex" title="{\lambda}" /> large. The other requirement to chooise <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta}" class="latex" title="{\delta}" /> is that it must majorize </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B2s%7D%7Br%28u%2B1%29%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \frac{2s}{r(u+1)}. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \frac{2s}{r(u+1)}. " /></p>
<p>We need <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+r%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta r^2}" class="latex" title="{\delta r^2}" /> to be small yet bigger than </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B2sr%7D%7Bu%2B1%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \frac{2sr}{u+1}. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \frac{2sr}{u+1}. " /></p>

For whatever number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" /> of points we are concerned with, we can meet this by making the degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{u}" class="latex" title="{u}" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> be larger than the degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{s}" class="latex" title="{s}" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> by the factor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2r%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2r}" class="latex" title="{2r}" />. That is all we need to do for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta}" class="latex" title="{\delta}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\lambda}" class="latex" title="{\lambda}" /> to exist that will allow us to apply the lemma. </p>
<p>
Thus the upshot is that suitably “lopsided” polynomials, together with a connected region of their partial derivatives, cannot have too many more than the prescribed number of zeroes, counting multiplicity of the orders of the zeroes. The proof of the lemma works by successive applications of reasoning about determinants and linear independence of polynomials that serve as components of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f(x,y)}" class="latex" title="{f(x,y)}" />. It is fairly long-winded and ends with some painstaking estimates. </p>
<p>
The application supposes for sake of contradiction that there are infinitely many fractions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7Bp%7D%7Bq%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\frac{p}{q}}" class="latex" title="{\frac{p}{q}}" /> giving closer approximations to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\alpha}" class="latex" title="{\alpha}" /> than the theorem statement allows. It suffices to consider the case where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\alpha}" class="latex" title="{\alpha}" /> is an algebraic integer—that is, a root of a univariate polynomial <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%28z%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{g(z)}" class="latex" title="{g(z)}" /> with integer coefficients. The supposition yields candidate polynomials <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f(x,y)}" class="latex" title="{f(x,y)}" /> as differences of two polynomials, one derived from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{g}" class="latex" title="{g}" /> and the other from the closely approximating fractions. The <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f(x,y)}" class="latex" title="{f(x,y)}" /> have both a large staircase of zeroes and a bounded space of possible coefficients, which imposes constraints on the degrees in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />. These elements can be manipulated, using the approximating fractions on one hand and the fact of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{g}" class="latex" title="{g}" /> (and hence its degree) being fixed on the other hand, to create the lopsided form of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f(x,y)}" class="latex" title="{f(x,y)}" /> in which the hypotheses of lemma <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#key">2</a> take effect. The lemma then cranks out a contradiction.</p>
<p>
At the end of his proof, Dyson deftly explains how taking <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t = 1}" class="latex" title="{t = 1}" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> results from the process that selects the sequence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t_i}" class="latex" title="{t_i}" /> for the lemma, yields Siegel’s theorem. Thus his framework affords an extra <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/08/05/give-me-a-lever/">lever</a> for manipulating ratios, in his case the ratio <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7Bs%7D%7Bt%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\frac{s}{t}}" class="latex" title="{\frac{s}{t}}" />. Tending the ratio to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7Br%2F2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sqrt{r/2}}" class="latex" title="{\sqrt{r/2}}" /> rather than to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{s}" class="latex" title="{s}" /> produces his theorem.</p>
<p>
Our point of interest is whether Dyson’s setup can be used to attack other questions about polynomials in complexity theory. We have not yet formed an understanding of how specific it is to the approximation application. Perhaps for complexity we would want to generalize it from polynomials in 2 to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> variables. There could be some relation to the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" />-variable techniques used for integer multiplication as we covered <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/03/29/integer-multiplication-in-nlogn-time/">here</a>, but again we’re just at the point of asking. Dyson ends his paper with the opinion that</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “such an investigation … would not be in any way a hopeless undertaking.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Have there been useful extensions of Dyson’s lemma, as opposed to improvements by Roth and others to his approximation bounds? Has Dyson’s “non-hopeless investigation” been brought to fruition? What other applications would it have? What are the closest techniques that have been used in complexity theory?</p>
<p>
The search for proving transcendental numbers has gone in other directions. These are represented in a survey <a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~matilde/NumberTheoryFormalLanguages.pdf">paper</a> by Jeffrey Shallit, which grew into the <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/asas.html">book</a> <em>Automatic Sequences</em> with Jean-Paul Allouche. To answer our reader question above, in the book they trace the transcendence of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csum_k+10%5E%7B-2%5Ek%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sum_k 10^{-2^k}}" class="latex" title="{\sum_k 10^{-2^k}}" /> to a 1916 <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1916-017-04/S0002-9947-1916-1501054-4/S0002-9947-1916-1501054-4.pdf">paper</a> by Aubrey Kempner which uses a different technique.</p>

<p>At least there’s that: I live in a world where some people care about it and publish their <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/3/243024-conferences-in-an-era-of-expensive-carbon/abstract">viewpoint in the latest CACM</a>. Read it on your next flight.  Some interesting things that won’t shock anyone:</p>



<p>There’s a nice picture with different environmental costs based on the location of the conference.  It also shows that people like to go to nearby conferences, one of the reasons why “The impulse to ignore the issue is entirely understandable.”  For more perspective see some of our earlier posts for example <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2020/02/18/working-remotely-will-be-the-most-significant-transformation-since-agriculture/">here</a> and <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2020/01/01/publish-and-perish/">here</a>.</p>



<p>The viewpoint also reports on a recent switch from in-person to online program committees for flagship conferences (POPL and ICFP), following a recent trend.  For starters we continue to suggest that <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2017/07/28/stocfocs-pc-meetings-does-nature-of-decisions-justify-cost/">STOC and FOCS do the same, because the nature of decisions does not justify the cost.</a> The latter post also includes hard numbers on the added value of a physical meeting (with respect to accept/reject decisions — of course one can value at infinity meeting in person luminaries in your field, but that can be done in other ways and should not be tied to PC meetings).</p>

<br />
(I injured my hand about a month ago so I have had a hard time typing. That is why<br />
I have not blogged for a while. I'm better now but still slow. This is a post I prepared<br />
a while back.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are some examples of English and logic for your discrete math class. Or for mine anyway.<br />
<br />
<br /></div>
<div>
1) <i>A computer programmer leaves work and heads for home. Being the good spouse that he is, he calls  his partner and asks if there's anything that needs to be picked up on the way.</i></div>
<div>
<i><br /></i></div>
<div>
<i>Yes, a gallon of milk and, oh, if they have <span class="il">eggs</span>, get a dozen.</i></div>
<div>
<i><br /></i></div>
<div>
<i>Later he arrives home and stumbles into the kitchen burdened with a dozen gallons of milk. His partner  perplexed, asks him ``why in the world did you buy 12 gallons of milk?''</i></div>
<div>
<i><br /></i></div>
<div>
<i>What did he answer?</i></div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
When I told this to my class one student said that he should answer:</div>
<div>
<br />
                                                      <i>I love you too Darling</i></div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
while that is always a good thing to tell Darling, it is not the answer I had in mind.<br />
<br /></div>
<div>
The  answer is  <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/eggs.txt">here</a>.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
2) I saw a headline:</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
                                                 <i> Rise in faux-incest porn alarming</i></div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Give two different interpretations of this sentence. (Note- One you might agree with, the other you will likely disagree with.)<br />
<br />
My answer is  <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/faux.txt">here</a></div>
<div>
<br />
3) Recently someone was describing what I work on to someone else and he said the following wonderfully ambiguous sentence<br />
<br />
                           <i>Bill works on puzzles and games. He also work on cake cutting, to be fair.</i><br />
<br />
Give two different interpretations of this sentence.  My answer is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/billcake.txt">here</a><br />
<br />
<br />
4) A common saying is<br />
<br />
                          <i> All that glitters is not gold</i><br />
<br />
What does this mean literally? What did they really mean to say? My answer is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/gold.txt">here.</a><br />
<br />
(I had originally thought this was a quote from the Led Zeppelin song <i>Stairway to Heaven</i>;<br />
however, an astute reader left a comment reminding me that, in that song, they actually<br />
say that there is a lady who believes <i>All that Glitters is Gold. </i>The song implies that she is incorrect, so really<br />
NOT(All that Glitters is Gold) which means (exists x)[x glitters but x is not gold] which actually<br />
IS what they meant to say. Yeah!)<br />
<br />
5)When the chess player Bobby Fisher died I saw in one article about him the sentence<br />
<i><br /></i>
<i>                                Bobby Fisher was a terrible anti-semite.</i><br />
<br />
<i></i>This can be interpreted two ways. What are they? Which one did the writer probably mean? My answer is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/fisher.txt">here</a><br />
<br />
6) When Donald Trump broke the Nuclear Treaty with Iran he said<br />
<br />
                             <i> Iran is the worse enabler of terrorist in the mideast</i><br />
<br />
This can be interpreted two ways. What are they? Which one did Trump mean? My answer is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/iran.txt">here.</a><br />
<br /></div>
<div>
<br />
7) I saw the headline (see <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2019/12/31/1905544/-There-was-actually-good-news-in-the-War-on-Women-in-2019-news-we-have-to-build-on-in-2020">here</a>)<br />
<br />
<i>There was actually good news in the War on Women in 2019, news we have to build on in 2020</i>.<br />
<br />
This can be interepreted in two ways. This one I leave to you, or read the article.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p class="justify-text">This month, I will follow up on <a href="https://francisbach.com/acceleration-without-pain/">last month’s blog post</a>, and describe classical techniques from numerical analysis that aim at accelerating the convergence of a vector sequence to its limit, by only combining elements of the sequence, and without the detailed knowledge of the iterative process that has led to this sequence. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Last month, I focused on sequences that converge to their limit exponentially fast (which is referred to as <em>linear</em> convergence), and I described <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitken%27s_delta-squared_process">Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\) method</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanks_transformation">Shanks transformation</a>, Anderson acceleration and its <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04133">regularized version</a>. These methods are called “non-linear” acceleration techniques, because, although they combine linearly iterates as \(c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1} + \cdots + c_m x_{k+m}\), the scalar weights in the linear combination depend non-linearly on \(x_k,\dots,x_{k+m}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I will focus on sequences that converge sublinearly, that is, with a difference to their limit that goes to zero as an inverse power of \(k\), typically in \(O(1/k)\). </p>



<h2>Richardson extrapolation</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider a sequence \((x_k)_{k \geq 0} \in \mathbb{R}^d\), with an asymptotic expansion of the form $$ x_k = x_\ast + \frac{1}{k}\Delta + O\Big(\frac{1}{k^2}\Big), $$ where \(x_\ast \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is the limit of \((x_k)_k\) and \(\Delta\) a vector in \(\mathbb{R}^d\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The idea behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson_extrapolation">Richardson extrapolation</a> [<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsta.1911.0009">1</a>] is to combine linearly two iterates taken at two different values of \(k\) so that the zero-th order term \(x_\ast\) is left unchanged, but the first order term in \(1/k\) cancels out. For \(k\) even, we can consider $$  2 x_k – x_{k/2} =  2 \Big( x_\ast + \frac{1}{k} \Delta  +O\Big(\frac{1}{k^2}\Big)  \Big) \, – \Big( x_\ast +  \frac{2}{k} \Delta  + O\Big(\frac{1}{k^2}\Big) \Big)  =  x_\ast +O\Big(\frac{1}{k^2}\Big).$$</p>

Iterates (in black) with their first-order expansions (in red). The deviations (represented by circles) are of order \(O(1/k^2)\).

<p class="justify-text">The key benefit of Richardson extrapolation is that we only need to know that the leading term in the asymptotic expansion is proportional to \(1/k\), <em>without the need to know the vector \(\Delta\)</em>. See an illustration below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/richardson_2d.gif" alt="" width="332" class="wp-image-2481" height="280" />Richardson extrapolation in two dimensions. The sequence is of the form \(x_k = \frac{1}{k} \Delta_1 + \frac{(-1)^k}{k^2} \Delta_2\). The extrapolated sequence \(2 x_k – x_{k/2}\) is only plotted for \(k\) even.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, following [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>], I will explore situations where Richardson extrapolation can be useful within machine learning. I identified three situations where Richardson extrapolation can be useful (there are probably more):</p>



<ol class="justify-text"><li>Iterates of an optimization algorithms \((x_k)_{k \geq 0}\), and the extrapolation is \( 2x_k – x_{k/2}.\)</li><li>Extrapolation on the step-size of stochastic gradient descent, where we will combine iterates obtained from two different values of the step-size.</li><li>Extrapolation on a regularization parameter.</li></ol>



<p class="justify-text">As we will show, extrapolation techniques come with no significant loss in performance, but in several situations strong gains. It is thus “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences">unreasonably effective</a>“.</p>



<h2>Application to optimization algorithms</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider an iterate \(x_k\) of an iterative optimization algorithm which is minimizing a function \(f\), thus converging to a global minimizer \(x_\ast\) of \(f\). Then so is \(x_{k/2}\), and thus also $$  x_k^{(1)} = 2x_k – x_{k/2}.$$ Therefore, performance is never significantly deteriorated (the risk is essentially to lose half of the iterations). The potential gains depend on the way \(x_k\) converges to \(x_\ast\). The existence of a convergence rate of the form \(f(x_k) -f(x_\ast) = O(1/k)\) or \(O(1/k^2)\) is not enough, as Richardson extrapolation requires a specific direction of asymptotic convergence. As illustrated below, some algorithms are oscillating around their solutions, while some converge with a specific direction. Only the latter ones can be accelerated with Richardson extrapolation, while the former ones are good candidates for <a href="https://francisbach.com/acceleration-without-pain/">Anderson acceleration</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nonoscillating_oscillating-1024x350.png" alt="" width="476" class="wp-image-2395" height="162" /> Left: Oscillating convergence, where Richardson extrapolation does not lead to any gain. Right: non-oscillating  convergence, with a main direction \(\Delta\) (in red dotted), where Richardson extrapolation can be beneficial if the oscillations orthogonal to the direction \(\Delta\) are negligible compared to convergence along the direction \(\Delta\). </figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Averaged gradient descent.</strong> We consider the usual gradient descent algorithm $$x_k = x_{k-1} – \gamma f'(x_{k-1}),$$ where \(\gamma &gt; 0 \) is a step-size, with Polyak-Ruppert averaging [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/0330046">4</a>]: $$ y_k = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} x_i.$$ Averaging is key to robustness to potential noise in the gradients [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/0330046">4</a>, <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/070704277">5</a>]. However it comes with the unintended consequence of losing the exponential forgetting of initial conditions for strongly-convex problems [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4316-non-asymptotic-analysis-of-stochastic-approximation-algorithms-for-machine-learning.pdf">6</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">A common way to restore exponential convergence (up to the noise level in the stochastic case) is to consider “tail-averaging”, that is, to replace \(y_k\) by the average of only the latest \(k/2\) iterates [<a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-595/16-595.pdf">7</a>]. As shown below for \(k\) even, this corresponds exactly to Richardson extrapolation on the sequence \((y_k)_k\): $$ \frac{2}{k} \sum_{i=k/2}^{k-1} x_i = \frac{2}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} x_i – \frac{2}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k/2-1} x_i = 2 y_k – y_{k/2}. $$</p>



<p class="justify-text">With basic  assumptions on \(f\), it is shown in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>] that for locally strongly-convex problems: $$y_k = x_\ast + \frac{1}{k} \Delta + O(\rho^k), $$ where  \(\displaystyle \Delta = \sum_{i=0}^\infty (x_i – x_\ast)\) and \(\rho \in (0,1)\) depends on the condition number of \(f”(x_\ast)\). This is illustrated below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/averaged_gradient.png" alt="" width="342" class="wp-image-2507" height="250" />Averaged gradient descent on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic regression</a> problem in dimension \(d=400\), and with \(n=4000\) observations. For the regular averaged recursion, the line in the log-log plot has slope \(-2\). See experimental details in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>].</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We can make the following observations:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>Before Richardson extrapolation, the asymptotic convergence rate after averaging is of order \(O(1/k^2)\), which is better than the usual \(O(1/k)\) upper-bound for the rate of gradient descent, but with a stronger assumption that in fact leads to exponential convergence before averaging.</li><li>While \(\Delta\) has a simple expression, it cannot be computed in practice (but Richardson extrapolation does not need to know it).</li><li>Richardson extrapolation leads to an exponentially convergent algorithm from an algorithm converging asymptotically in \(O(1/k^2)\).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Accelerated gradient descent.</strong> Above, we considered averaged gradient descent, which is asymptotically converging as \(O(1/k^2)\), and on which Richardson extrapolation could be used with strong gains. Is it possible also for the accelerated gradient descent method [<a href="http://www.mathnet.ru/php/getFT.phtml?jrnid=dan&amp;paperid=46009&amp;what=fullt&amp;option_lang=eng">8</a>], which has a (non-asymptotic) convergence rate of \(O(1/k^2)\) for convex functions?</p>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out that the behavior of the iterates of accelerated gradient descent is exactly of the form depicted in the left plot of the figure above: that is, the iterates \(x_k\) oscillate around the optimum [<a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume17/15-084/15-084.pdf">9</a>, <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v40/Flammarion15.pdf">10</a>], and Richardson extrapolation is of no help, but is not degrading performance too much. See below for an illustration. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/accelerated_gradient.png" alt="" width="332" class="wp-image-2509" height="243" />Accelerated gradient descent on a quadratic optimization problem in dimension \(d=1000\). See experimental details in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>].  </figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Other algorithms.</strong> It is tempting to test it on other optimization algorithms. For example, as explained in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>], Richardson extrapolation can be used to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank%E2%80%93Wolfe_algorithm">Frank-Wolfe</a> algorithm, where sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn’t. Others could be tried.</p>



<h2>Extrapolation on the step-size of stochastic gradient descent</h2>



<p class="justify-text">While above we have focused on Richardson extrapolation applied to the number of iterations of an iterative algorithm, it is most often used in integration methods (for computing integrals or solving ordinary differential equations), and then often referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romberg%27s_method">Romberg-Richardson extrapolation</a>. Within machine learning, in a similar spirit, this can be applied to the step-size of stochastic gradient descent [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06386">3</a>, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6514-stochastic-gradient-richardson-romberg-markov-chain-monte-carlo.pdf">11</a>], which I now describe.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We consider the minimization of a function \(F(x)\) defined on \(\mathbb{R}^d\), which can be written as an expectation as $$F(x) = \mathbb{E}_{z} f(x,z).$$ We assume that we have access to \(n\) independent and identically distributed observations (i.i.d.) \(z_1,\dots,z_n\). This is a typical scenario in machine learning, where \(f(x,z)\) represents the loss for the predictor parameterized by \(x\) on the observation \(z\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">The stochastic gradient method is particularly well adapted, and we consider here a single pass, as $$x_i= x_{i-1} – \gamma f'(x_{i-1},z_i),$$ where the gradient is taken with respect to the first variable, for \(i = 1,\dots,n\). It is known that with a constant step-size, when \(n\) tends to infinity, \(x_n\) will <em>not</em> converge to the minimizer \(x_\ast\) of \(F\), as the algorithm always moves [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/0324039">16</a>], as illustrated below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/logistic_2d-1.gif" alt="" width="403" class="wp-image-2488" height="279" />Stochastic gradient descent on a logistic regression problem: (blue) without averaging, (red) with averaging.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">One way to damp the oscillations is to consider averaging, that is, $$ y_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i$$ (we consider uniform averaging for simplicity). For least-squares regression, this leads to a converging algorithm [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4900-non-strongly-convex-smooth-stochastic-approximation-with-convergence-rate-o1n.pdf">12</a>] with attractive properties for ill-conditioned problems (see also <a href="https://francisbach.com/the-sum-of-a-geometric-series-is-all-you-need/">January’s blog post</a>). However, for general loss functions, it is shown in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06386">3</a>] that \(y_n\) converges to some \(y^{(\gamma)} \neq x_\ast\). There is a bias due to a step-size \(\gamma\) that does not go to zero. In order to apply Richardson extrapolation, together with Aymeric Dieuleveut and Alain Durmus [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06386">3</a>], we showed that $$ y^{(\gamma)} = x_\ast + \gamma \Delta + O(\gamma^2),$$ for some \(\Delta \in \mathbb{R}^d\) with some complex expression. Thus, we have $$2 y^{(\gamma)} – y^{(2\gamma)} = x_\ast + O(\gamma^2),$$ thus gaining one order. If we consider the iterate \(y_n^{(\gamma)}\) and \(y_n^{(2 \gamma)}\) associated to the two step-sizes \(\gamma\) and \(2 \gamma\), the linear combination $$2 y_n^{(\gamma)} – y_n^{(2\gamma)} $$ has an improved behavior as it tends to \(2 y^{(\gamma)} – y^{(2\gamma)} = x_\ast + O(\gamma^2)\): it remains not convergent, but get to way smaller values. See an illustration below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SGD_logistic-1.png" alt="" width="359" class="wp-image-2525" height="274" />Averaged stochastic gradient descent on a logistic regression problem in dimension 20.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Higher-order extrapolation.</strong> If we can accelerate a sequence by extrapolation, why not extrapolate the extrapolated sequence? This is possible if we have an higher-order expansion of the form $$ y^{(\gamma)} = \theta_\ast + \gamma \Delta_1 + \gamma^2 \Delta_2 + O(\gamma^3),$$ for some (typically unknown) vectors \(\Delta_1\) and \(\Delta_2\). Then, the sharp reader can check that $$3 y_n^{(\gamma)} – 3 y_n^{(2\gamma)} +  y_n^{(3\gamma)}, $$ will lead to cancellation of the first two orders \(\gamma\) and \(\gamma^2\). This is illustrated above for SGD.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Then, why not extrapolate the extrapolation of the extrapolated sequence? One can check that $$4 y_n^{(\gamma)} – 6 y_n^{(2\gamma)} + 4  y_n^{(3\gamma)}  -y_n^{(4\gamma)}, $$ will lead to cancellation of the first three orders of an expansion of \(y^{(\gamma)}\). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient">binomial coefficient</a> aficionados have already noticed the pattern there, and checked that $$ \sum_{i=1}^{m+1} (-1)^{i-1} { m+1 \choose i} y_n^{(i\gamma)}$$ will lead to cancellations of the first \(m\) orders.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Then, why not go on forever? First because \(m+1\) recursions have to be run in parallel, and second, because the constant in front of the term in \(\gamma^{m+1}\) typically explodes, a phenomenon common to many expansion methods.</p>



<h2>Extrapolation on a regularization parameter</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now explore the application of Richardson extrapolation to regularization methods. In a nutshell, regularization allows to make an estimation problem more stable (less subject to variations for statistical problems) or the algorithm faster (for optimization problems). However, regularization adds a bias that needs to be removed. In this section, we apply Richardson extrapolation to the regularization parameter to reduce this bias. I will only present an application to smoothing for non-smooth optimization (see an application to  ridge regression in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Non-smooth optimization problems</strong>. We consider the minimization of a convex function of the form \(f = h + g\), where \(h\) is smooth and \(g\) is non-smooth. These optimization problems are ubiquitous in machine learning and signal processing, where the lack of smoothness can come from (a) non-smooth losses such as max-margin losses used in support vector machines and more generally structured output classification [<a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2005/proceedings/papers/113_StructuredPrediction_TaskarEtAl.pdf">13</a>], and (b) sparsity-inducing regularizers (see, e.g., [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/bach_jenatton_mairal_obozinski_FOT.pdf">14</a>] and references therein). While many algorithms can be used to deal with this non-smoothness, we consider a classical smoothing technique below.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Nesterov smoothing</strong>. In this section, we consider the smoothing approach of Nesterov [<a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~sqma/MAT258A_Files/Nesterov-2005.pdf">15</a>] where the non-smooth term is “smoothed” into \(g_\lambda\), where \(\lambda\) is a regularization parameter, and accelerated gradient descent is used to minimize \(h+g_\lambda\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">A typical way of smoothing the function \(g\) is to add \(\lambda\) times a strongly convex regularizer (such as the squared Euclidean norm) to the Fenchel conjugate of \(g\); this leads to a function \(g_\lambda\) which has a smoothness constant (defined as the maximum of the largest eigenvalues of all Hessians) proportional to \(1/\lambda\), with a uniform error of \(O(\lambda)\) between \(g\) and \(g_\lambda\). Given that accelerated gradient descent leads to an iterate with excess function values proportional to \(1/(\lambda k^2)\) after \(k\) iterations, with the choice of \(\lambda \propto 1/k\), this leads to an excess in function values proportional to \(1/k\), which improves on the subgradient method which converges in \(O(1/\sqrt{k})\). Note that the amount of regularization depends on the number of iterations, so that this smoothing method is not “anytime”.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Richardson extrapolation.</strong> If we denote by \(x_\lambda\) the minimizer of \(h+g_\lambda\) and \( x_\ast\) the global minimizer of \( f=h+g\), if we can show that \( x_\lambda = x_\ast + \lambda \Delta + O(\lambda^2)\), then \( x^{(1)}_\lambda = 2 x_\lambda – x_{2\lambda} = O(\lambda^2)\) and we can expand \( f(x_\lambda^{(1)})  = f(x_\ast)  + O(\lambda^2)\), which is better than the \(O(\lambda)\) approximation without extrapolation. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Then, given a number of iterations \(k\), with \( \lambda \propto k^{-2/3}\), to balance the two terms \( 1/(\lambda k^2)\) and \( \lambda^2\),  we get an overall convergence rate for the non-smooth problem of \( k^{-4/3}\). </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>\(m\)-step Richardson extrapolation</strong>. Like above for the step-size, we can also consider \(m\)-step Richardson extrapolation \(x_{\lambda}^{(m)}\), which leads to a bias proportional to \(\lambda^{m+1}\). Thus, if we consider \(\lambda \propto 1/k^{2/(m+2)}\), to balance the terms \(1/(\lambda k^2)\) and \(\lambda^{m+1}\), we get an error for the non-smooth problem of \(1/k^{2(m+1)/(m+2)}\), which can get arbitrarily close to \(1/k^2\) when \(m\) gets large. The downsides (like for the extrapolation on the step-size above) are that (a) the constants in front of the asymptotic equivalent may blow up (a classical problem in high-order expansions), and (b) \(m\)-step extrapolation requires running the algorithm \(m\) times (this can be down in parallel). In the experiment below, 3-step extrapolation already brings in most of the benefits.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to experimentally study the benefits of extrapolation, for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)">Lasso</a> optimization problem, and for a series of regularization parameters equal to \(2^{i}\) for \(i\) between \(-18\) and \(1\) (sampled every \(1/5\)), we run accelerated gradient descent on \(h+g_\lambda\) and we plot the value of \(f(x)-f(x_\ast)\) for the various estimates, where for each number of iterations, we minimize over the regularization parameter. This is an oracle version of varying \(\lambda\) as a function of the number of iterations. </p>

There is indeed a strong improvement approaching the rate \(1/k^2\).</figure></div>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">These last two blog posts were dedicated to acceleration techniques coming from numerical analysis. They are cheap to implement, typically do not interfere with the underlying algorithm, and when used in the appropriate situation, can bring in significant speed-ups.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Next month, I will most probably host an invited post by my colleague <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~ataylor/">Adrien Taylor</a>, who will explain how machines can <s>replace</s> help researchers that prove bounds on optimization algorithms.</p>

These posts abstract a graph to a 2-polymatroid, the function that maps a subset of edges to the number of vertices it touches. This resembles matroid rank, but a single edge has rank 2. This leads to a notion of a dual, which usually does not come from a graph, with an interesting operation of “exploding” edges dual to edge deletion.</p>

    <p>My graph algorithm lectures on stable matching have shifted their terminology and metaphors to stable matching from stable marriage (outdated, sexist, heteronormative, potentially offensive, and not a good fit for the applications) but so far Wikipedia hasn’t. Maybe the ngram below explains why: there’s a base level of colloquial usage of “stable marriage” masking the popularity of “matching” in technical usage. Google Scholar shows a clearer picture: 3940 hits for “stable matching” since 2016, 2710 for “stable marriage”. (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/103717212351898100"></a>).</p>

    <p>You can encode complex numbers as pairs of real numbers, their real and imaginary parts, and perform complex arithmetic using only real-number operations. But can you go the other way, and encode real numbers somehow using complex arithmetic? <a href="http://jdh.hamkins.org/the-real-numbers-are-not-interpretable-in-the-complex-field/">Joel David Hamkins gives a simple proof of the folklore result that the answer is no</a> (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/103738094179310308"></a>). The short reason why not: there are too few equivalence classes of k-tuples of them to use as representatives of the reals.</p>

<p>Today, as the world braces for the possibility of losing millions of lives to the new coronavirus—to the <em>hunger for pangolin meat</em>, of all things (combined with the evisceration of competent public health agencies like the CDC)—we also mourn the loss of two incredibly special lives, those of Freeman Dyson (age 96) and Boris Tsirelson (age 69).</p>



<p>Freeman Dyson was sufficiently legendary, both within and beyond the worlds of math and physics, that there’s very little I can add to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/28/science/freeman-dyson-dead.html">what’s been said</a>.  It seemed like he was immortal, although I’d heard from mutual friends that his health was failing over the past year.  When I spent a year as a postdoc at the Institute for Advanced Study, in 2004-5, I often sat across from Dyson in the common room, while he drank tea and read the news.  That I never once struck up a conversation with him is a regret that I’ll now carry with me forever.</p>



<p>My only exchange with Dyson came when he gave a lecture at UC Berkeley, about how life might persist infinitely far into the future, even after the last stars had burnt out, by feeding off steadily dimishing negentropy flows in the nearly-thermal radiation.  During the Q&amp;A, I challenged Dyson that his proposal seemed to assume an analog model of computation.  But, I asked, once we took on board the quantum-gravity insights of Jacob Bekenstein and others, suggesting that nature behaves like a (quantum) digital computer at the Planck scale, with at most ~10<sup>43</sup> operations per second and ~10<sup>69</sup> qubits per square meter and so forth, wasn’t this sort of proposal ruled out?  “I’m not going to argue with you,” was Dyson’s response.  Yes, he’d assumed an analog computational model; if computation was digital then that surely changed the picture.</p>



<p>Sometimes—and not just with his climate skepticism, but also (e.g.) with his idea that general relativity and quantum mechanics <em>didn’t need to be reconciled</em>, that it was totally fine for the deepest layer of reality to be a patchwork of inconsistent theories—Dyson’s views struck me as not merely contrarian but as a high-level form of trolling.  Even so, Dyson’s book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Disturbing-Universe-Sloan-Foundation-Science/dp/0465016774">Disturbing the Universe</a></em> had had a major impact on me as a teenager, for the sparkling prose as much as for the ideas.</p>



<p>With Dyson’s passing, the scientific world has lost one of its last direct links to a heroic era, of Einstein and Oppenheimer and von Neumann and a young Richard Feynman, when theoretical physics stood at the helm of civilization like never before or since.  Dyson, who apparently remained not only lucid but <em>mathematically powerful</em> (!) well into his last year, clearly remembered when the Golden Age of science fiction looked like simply sober forecasting; when the smartest young people, rather than denouncing each other on Twitter, dreamed of scouting the solar system in thermonuclear-explosion-powered spacecraft and seriously worked to make that happen.</p>



<p>Boris Tsirelson (<a href="http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~tsirel/">homepage</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Tsirelson">Wikipedia</a>), who emigrated from the Soviet Union and then worked at Tel Aviv University (where my wife Dana attended his math lectures), wasn’t nearly as well known as Dyson to the wider world, but was equally beloved within the quantum computing and information community.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsirelson%27s_bound">Tsirelson’s bound</a>, which he proved in the 1980s, showed that even quantum mechanics could only violate the Bell inequality by so much and by no more, could only let Alice and Bob win the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/quantum18/lecture07.pdf">CHSH game</a> with probability cos<sup>2</sup>(π/8).  This seminal result anticipated many of the questions that would only be asked decades later with the rise of quantum information.  Tsirelson’s investigations of quantum nonlocality also led him to pose the famous <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0812.4305">Tsirelson’s problem</a>: loosely speaking, can all sets of quantum correlations that can arise from an infinite amount of entanglement, be arbitrarily well approximated using <em>finite</em> amounts of entanglement?  The spectacular answer—no—was only announced one month ago, as a corollary of the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4512">MIP*=RE breakthrough</a>, something that Tsirelson happily lived to see although I don’t know what his reaction was (<font color="red"><strong>update:</strong></font> I’m told that he indeed learned of it in his final weeks, and was happy about it).  Sadly, for some reason, I never met Tsirelson in person, although I did have lively email exchanges with him 10-15 years ago about his problem and other topics.  This <a href="https://www.iqoqi-vienna.at/en/blog/article/boris-tsirelson/?fbclid=IwAR1PrVvK0u5XmnFLLoPMzMN3x9rY1WIdp1wrYZ_yYPlqSGRpXDkollYTCR0">amusing interview</a> with Tsirelson gives some sense for his personality (hat tip to Gil Kalai, who knew Tsirelson well).</p>



<p>Please share any memories of Dyson or Tsirelson in the comments section.</p></div>
