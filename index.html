of recovering, given two graphs, a one-to-one mapping between nodes that
maximizes edge overlap. This problem can be viewed as a noisy version of the
well-known graph isomorphism problem and appears in many applications,
including social network deanonymization and cellular biology. Our focus here
is on partial recovery, i.e., we look for a one-to-one mapping which is correct
on a fraction of the nodes of the graph rather than on all of them, and we
assume that the two input graphs to the problem are correlated Erd\"os-R\'enyi
graphs of parameters $(n,q,s)$. Our main contribution is then to give necessary
and sufficient conditions on $(n,q,s)$ under which partial recovery is possible
with high probability as the number of nodes $n$ goes to infinity. These
conditions are compact, easily interpretable, and cover a vast majority of the
parameter space.

$f(X):=\tilde{f}(X)\bmod p$ factorizes into $n$ distinct linear factors over
$\mathbb{F}_p$. We study the problem of deterministically factoring $f(X)$ over
$\mathbb{F}_p$ given $\tilde{f}(X)$. Under the generalized Riemann hypothesis
(GRH), we give an improved deterministic algorithm that computes the complete
factorization of $f(X)$ in the case that the Galois group of $\tilde{f}(X)$ is
(permutation isomorphic to) a linear group $G\leq \mathrm{GL}(V)$ on the set
$S$ of roots of $\tilde{f}(X)$, where $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space
over a finite field $\mathbb{F}$ and $S$ is identified with a subset of $V$. In
particular, when $|S|=|V|^{\Omega(1)}$, the algorithm runs in time polynomial
in $n^{\log n/(\log\log\log\log n)^{1/3}}$ and the size of the input, improving
Evdokimov's algorithm. Our result also applies to a general Galois group $G$

<p>To prove our main result, we introduce a family of objects called linear
$m$-schemes and reduce the problem of factoring $f(X)$ to a combinatorial
problem about these objects. We then apply techniques from additive
combinatorics to obtain an improved bound. Our techniques may be of independent
interest.

weight and cost of a solid part. Currently, most infill structure generation
methods are based on the conventional 2.5-axis printing configuration, which,
although able to satisfy the self-supporting condition on the infills, suffer
from the well-known stair-case effect on the finished surface and the need of
extensive support for overhang features. In this paper, based on the emerging
continuous multi-axis printing configuration, we present a new lattice infill
structure generation algorithm, which is able to achieve both the
self-supporting condition for the infills and the support-free requirement at
the boundary surface of the part. The algorithm critically relies on the use of
three mutually orthogonal geodesic distance fields that are embedded in the
tetrahedral mesh of the solid model. The intersection between the iso-geodesic
distance surfaces of these three geodesic distance fields naturally forms the
desired lattice of infill structure, while the density of the infills can be
conveniently controlled by adjusting the iso-values. The lattice infill pattern
in each curved slicing layer is trimmed to conform to an Eulerian graph so to
generate a continuous printing path, which can effectively reduce the nozzle
retractions during the printing process. In addition, to cater to the
collision-free requirement and to improve the printing efficiency, we also
propose a printing sequence optimization algorithm for determining a
collision-free order of printing of the connected lattice infills, which seeks
to reduce the air-move length of the nozzle. Ample experiments in both computer
simulation and physical printing are performed, and the results give a
preliminary confirmation of the advantages of our methodology.

psychometric parameters. Most applications used myopic one-step ahead strategy
which only optimizes the immediate utility. The widely held expectation is that
global optimization strategies that explicitly optimize over some horizon can
largely improve the performance of the myopic strategy. With limited studies
that compared myopic and global strategies, the expectation was not challenged
and researchers are still investing heavily to achieve global optimization. Is
that really worthwhile? This paper provides a discouraging answer based on
experimental simulations comparing the performance improvement and computation
burden between global and myopic strategies in parameter estimation of multiple
models. The finding is that the added horizon in global strategies has
negligible contributions to the improvement of optimal global utility other
than the most immediate next steps (of myopic strategy). Mathematical recursion
is derived to prove that the contribution of utility improvement of each added
horizon step diminishes fast as that step moves further into the future.

scene in an end-to-end fashion is still far from being achieved. Instead, here
we follow a two stages approach, where interpretable information is included in
the loop and each actor is modelled independently. We leverage a per-object
novel view synthesis paradigm; i.e. generating a synthetic representation of an
object undergoing a geometrical roto-translation in the 3D space. Our model can
be easily conditioned with constraints (e.g. input trajectories) provided by
state-of-the-art tracking methods or by the user itself. This allows us to
generate a set of diverse realistic futures starting from the same input in a
multi-modal fashion. We visually and quantitatively show the superiority of
this approach over traditional end-to-end scene-generation methods on CityFlow,
a challenging real world dataset.

which are known to $\epsilon$-approximate any random utility model. Despite its
long history and broad use, rigorous results are only available for learning a
uniform mixture of two MNLs. Continuing this line of research, we study the
problem of learning an arbitrary mixture of two MNLs. We show that the
identifiability of the mixture models may only fail on an algebraic variety of
Lebesgue measure $0$, implying that all existing algorithms apply in the almost
sure sense. This is done by reducing the problem of learning a mixture of two
MNLs to the problem of solving a system of univariate quartic equations. As a
byproduct, we derive an algorithm to learn any mixture of two MNLs in linear
time provided that a mixture of two MNLs over some finite universe is
identifiable. Several numerical experiments and conjectures are also presented.

their capability of learning to extract robust and descriptive features from
high dimensional data, like images. Hence, such an ability renders their
exploitation as feature extractors particularly frequent in an abundant of
modern reasoning systems. Their application scope mainly includes complex
cascade tasks, like multi-modal recognition and deep Reinforcement Learning
(RL). However, NNs induce implicit biases that are difficult to avoid or to
deal with and are not met in traditional image descriptors. Moreover, the lack
of knowledge for describing the intra-layer properties -- and thus their
general behavior -- restricts the further applicability of the extracted
features. With the paper at hand, a novel way of visualizing and understanding
the vector space before the NNs' output layer is presented, aiming to enlighten
the deep feature vectors' properties under classification tasks. Main attention
is paid to the nature of overfitting in the feature space and its adverse
effect on further exploitation. We present the findings that can be derived
from our model's formulation, and we evaluate them on realistic recognition
scenarios, proving its prominence by improving the obtained results.

selecting a small diverse subset out of a large collection of items, with
applications in summarization, stochastic optimization, active learning and
more. Given a kernel function and a subset size $k$, our goal is to sample $k$
out of $n$ items with probability proportional to the determinant of the kernel
matrix induced by the subset (a.k.a. $k$-DPP). Existing $k$-DPP sampling
algorithms require an expensive preprocessing step which involves multiple
passes over all $n$ items, making it infeasible for large datasets. A na\"ive
heuristic addressing this problem is to uniformly subsample a fraction of the
data and perform $k$-DPP sampling only on those items, however this method
offers no guarantee that the produced sample will even approximately resemble
the target distribution over the original dataset. In this paper, we develop an
algorithm which adaptively builds a sufficiently large uniform sample of data
that is then used to efficiently generate a smaller set of $k$ items, while
ensuring that this set is drawn exactly from the target distribution defined on
all $n$ items. We show empirically that our algorithm produces a $k$-DPP sample
after observing only a small fraction of all elements, leading to several
orders of magnitude faster performance compared to the state-of-the-art.

science as an operation that approximately reverses the effect of a quantum
channel. The pretty good measurement is a special case of the Petz recovery
channel, and it allows for near-optimal state discrimination. A hurdle to the
experimental realization of these vaunted theoretical tools is the lack of a
systematic and efficient method to implement them. This paper sets out to
rectify this lack: using the recently developed tools of quantum singular value
transformation and oblivious amplitude amplification, we provide a quantum
algorithm to implement the Petz recovery channel when given the ability to
perform the channel that one wishes to reverse. Moreover, we prove that our
quantum algorithm's usage of the channel implementation cannot be improved by
more than a quadratic factor. Our quantum algorithm also provides a procedure
to perform pretty good measurements when given multiple copies of the states
that one is trying to distinguish.

Suppose there is a collection of agents, a collection of tasks, and a demand
vector, which specifies the number of agents required to perform each task. The
goal of the agents is to cooperatively allocate themselves to the tasks to
satisfy the demand vector. We study the dynamic version of the problem where
the demand vector changes over time. Here, the goal is to minimize the
switching cost, which is the number of agents that change tasks in response to
a change in the demand vector. The switching cost is an important metric since
changing tasks may incur significant overhead.

<p>We study a mathematical formalization of the above problem introduced by Su,
Su, Dornhaus, and Lynch, which can be reformulated as a question of finding a
low distortion embedding from symmetric difference to Hamming distance. In this
model it is trivial to prove that the switching cost is at least 2. We present
the first non-trivial lower bounds for the switching cost, by giving lower
bounds of 3 and 4 for different ranges of the parameters.

given objective function so as to provide a service to all clients. These are
one of the most well-studied optimization problems spanning many research areas
such as operations research, computer science, and management science.
Traditionally, these problems are solved with the assumption that clients need
to be served by one facility each. In many real-world scenarios, it is very
likely that clients need a robust service that requires more than one facility
for each client. In this paper, we capture this robustness by exploring a
generalization of Facility Location problems, called Multi-Facility Location
problems, in the online setting. An additional parameter k, which represents
the number of facilities required to serve a client, is given. We propose the

for short) reconfiguration sequence between two dominating sets $D_{\sf s}$ and
$D_{\sf t}$ of size at most $k$ is a sequence $S= \langle D_0 = D_{\sf s}, D_1
\ldots, D_\ell = D_{\sf t} \rangle$ of dominating sets of $G$ such that any two
consecutive dominating sets differ by the addition or deletion of one vertex,
and no dominating set has size bigger than $k$.

<p>We first improve a result of Haas and Seyffarth, by showing that if
$k=\Gamma(G)+\alpha(G)-1$ (where $\Gamma(G)$ is the maximum size of a minimal
dominating set and $\alpha(G)$ the maximum size of an independent set), then
there exists a linear {\sf TAR} reconfiguration sequence between any pair of
dominating sets.

<p>We then improve these results on several graph classes by showing that the
same holds for $K_{\ell}$-minor free graph as long as $k \ge \Gamma(G)+O(\ell
\sqrt{\log \ell})$ and for planar graphs whenever $k \ge \Gamma(G)+3$. Finally,
we show that if $k=\Gamma(G)+tw(G)+1$, then there also exists a linear
transformation between any pair of dominating sets.

modified, algorithm updates the set of vertex guards and their positions for
guarding the modified orthogonal polygon. Our algorithm modifies the guard
placement locally while ensuring the updated orthogonal polygon with $h$ holes
and $n$ vertices, is guarded using at most $\lfloor (n+2h)/4 \rfloor$ vertex
guards. The algorithm to update vertex guards after any modification to the
polygon takes $O(k \lg{(n+ n')})$ amortized time. Here, $n'$ and $n$ are the
number of vertices of the orthogonal polygon before and after the update,
respectively; and, $k$ is the sum of the number of vertices added to or removed
from the orthogonal polygon, the number of cuts in the L-shaped partitioning of
the free space of the orthogonal polygon that got affected due to the update,
and the number of channels affected due to the update. For the special case of
the initial orthogonal polygon being hole-free, and each update resulting in a
hole-free orthogonal polygon, our dynamic guard updating algorithm takes
$O(k\lg{(n+n')})$ worst-case time. Initially, we preprocess the input
orthogonal polygon with $q$ vertices in $O(q \lg{q})$ time to construct data

from an input graph $G$ to a fixed graph $H$. Faben and Jerrum [ToC'15]
introduced an explicit criterion on the graph $H$ and conjectured that, if
satisfied, the problem is solvable in polynomial time and, otherwise, the
problem is complete for the complexity class $\oplus\mathrm{P}$ of parity
problems. We verify their conjecture for all graphs $H$ that exclude the
complete graph on $4$ vertices as a minor. Further, we rule out the existence
of a subexponential-time algorithm for the $\oplus\mathrm{P}$-complete cases,
assuming the randomised Exponential Time Hypothesis. Our proofs introduce a
novel method of deriving hardness from globally defined substructures of the
fixed graph $H$. Using this, we subsume all prior progress towards resolving
the conjecture (Faben and Jerrum [ToC'15]; G\"obel, Goldberg and Richerby
[ToCT'14,'16]). As special cases, our machinery also yields a proof of the
conjecture for graphs with maximum degree at most $3$, as well as a full

SPLITTING and $\epsilon$-CONSENSUS SPLITTING. In the problem
$\epsilon$-CONSENSUS SPLITTING, there are $n$ non-atomic probability measures
on the interval $[0, 1]$ and $k$ agents. The goal is to divide the interval,
via at most $n (k-1)$ cuts, into pieces and distribute them to the $k$ agents
in an approximately equitable way, so that the discrepancy between the shares
of any two agents, according to each measure, is at most $2 \epsilon / k$. It
is known that this is possible even for $\epsilon = 0$. NECKLACE SPLITTING is a
discrete version of $\epsilon$-CONSENSUS SPLITTING. For $k = 2$ and some
absolute positive constant $\epsilon$, both of these problems are PPAD-hard.
</p>
<p>We consider two types of approximation. The first provides every agent a
positive amount of measure of each type under the constraint of making at most
$n (k - 1)$ cuts. The second obtains an approximately equitable split with as
few cuts as possible. Apart from the offline model, we consider the online
model as well, where the interval (or necklace) is presented as a stream, and
decisions about cutting and distributing must be made on the spot.
</p>
<p>For the first type of approximation, we describe an efficient algorithm that
gives every agent at least $\frac{1}{nk}$ of each measure and works even
online. For the second type of approximation, we provide an efficient online
algorithm that makes $\text{poly}(n, k, \epsilon)$ cuts and an offline
algorithm making $O(nk \log \frac{k}{\epsilon})$ cuts. We also establish lower
bounds for the number of cuts required in the online model for both problems
even for $k=2$ agents, showing that the number of cuts in our online algorithm
is optimal up to a logarithmic factor.

dimensions $x_{1},\ldots, x_{n} \in R^{d}$, an integer $1 \leq k \leq d$, and
an outlier parameter $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$, is to find a $k$-dimensional
linear subspace of $R^{d}$ that minimizes the sum of squared distances to its
nearest $(1-\alpha)n$ points. More generally, the $\ell_{p}$ subspace
approximation problem with outliers minimizes the sum of $p$-th powers of
distances instead of the sum of squared distances. Even the case of robust PCA
is non-trivial, and previous work requires additional assumptions on the input.
Any multiplicative approximation algorithm for the subspace approximation
problem with outliers must solve the robust subspace recovery problem, a
special case in which the $(1-\alpha)n$ inliers in the optimal solution are
promised to lie exactly on a $k$-dimensional linear subspace. However, robust
subspace recovery is Small Set Expansion (SSE)-hard.
</p>
<p>We show how to extend dimension reduction techniques and bi-criteria
approximations based on sampling to the problem of subspace approximation with
outliers. To get around the SSE-hardness of robust subspace recovery, we assume
that the squared distance error of the optimal $k$-dimensional subspace summed
over the optimal $(1-\alpha)n$ inliers is at least $\delta$ times its
squared-error summed over all $n$ points, for some $0 &lt; \delta \leq 1 -
\alpha$. With this assumption, we give an efficient algorithm to find a subset
of $poly(k/\epsilon) \log(1/\delta) \log\log(1/\delta)$ points whose span
contains a $k$-dimensional subspace that gives a multiplicative
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to the optimal solution. The running time of our
algorithm is linear in $n$ and $d$. Interestingly, our results hold even when
the fraction of outliers $\alpha$ is large, as long as the obvious condition $0
&lt; \delta \leq 1 - \alpha$ is satisfied.

\mathbb{F}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ with coefficients from a field $\mathbb{F}$ belongs
to a given ideal $I \subseteq \mathbb{F}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$. It is a well-known
fundamental problem with many important applications, though notoriously
intractable in the general case. In this paper we consider the IMP for
polynomial ideals encoding combinatorial problems and where the input
polynomial $f$ has degree at most $d=O(1)$ (we call this problem IMP$_d$). A
dichotomy result between ``hard'' (NP-hard) and ``easy'' (polynomial time) IMPs
was recently achieved for Constraint Satisfaction Problems over finite domains
[Bulatov FOCS'17, Zhuk FOCS'17] (this is equivalent to IMP$_0$) and IMP$_d$ for
the Boolean domain [Mastrolilli SODA'19], both based on the classification of
the IMP through functions called polymorphisms. The complexity of the IMP$_d$
for five polymorphisms has been solved in [Mastrolilli SODA'19] whereas for the
ternary minority polymorphism it was incorrectly declared to have been resolved
by a previous result. As a matter of fact the complexity of the IMP$_d$ for the
ternary minority polymorphism is open. In this paper we provide the missing
link by proving that the IMP$_d$ for Boolean combinatorial ideals whose
constraints are closed under the minority polymorphism can be solved in
polynomial time. This result, along with the results in [Mastrolilli SODA'19],
completes the identification of the precise borderline of tractability for the
IMP$_d$ for constrained problems over the Boolean domain. This paper is
motivated by the pursuit of understanding the issue of bit complexity of
Sum-of-Squares proofs raised by O'Donnell [ITCS'17]. Raghavendra and Weitz
[ICALP'17] show how the IMP$_d$ tractability for combinatorial ideals implies
bounded coefficients in Sum-of-Squares proofs.

used widely to represent heterogeneous data. In the simplest form, this model
assumes that the labels are generated from either of two different linear
models and mixed together. Recent works of Yin et al. and Krishnamurthy et al.,
2019, focus on an experimental design setting of model recovery for this
problem. It is assumed that the features can be designed and queried with to
obtain their label. When queried, an oracle randomly selects one of the two
different sparse linear models and generates a label accordingly. How many such
oracle queries are needed to recover both of the models simultaneously? This
question can also be thought of as a generalization of the well-known
compressed sensing problem (Cand\`es and Tao, 2005, Donoho, 2006). In this
work, we address this query complexity problem and provide efficient algorithms
that improves on the previously best known results.

users. The typical objective is to maximize the advertiser's cumulative revenue
over a period of time under a budget constraint. In real applications, an
advertisement (ad) usually needs to be exposed to the same user multiple times
until the user finally contributes revenue (e.g., places an order). However,
existing advertising systems mainly focus on the immediate revenue with single
ad exposures, ignoring the contribution of each exposure to the final
conversion, thus usually falls into suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we
formulate the sequential advertising strategy optimization as a dynamic
knapsack problem. We propose a theoretically guaranteed bilevel optimization
framework, which significantly reduces the solution space of the original
optimization space while ensuring the solution quality. To improve the
exploration efficiency of reinforcement learning, we also devise an effective
action space reduction approach. Extensive offline and online experiments show
the superior performance of our approaches over state-of-the-art baselines in
terms of cumulative revenue.

machine learning applications. Finding a Tucker decomposition is a nonconvex
optimization problem. As the scale of the problems increases, local search
algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent have become popular in practice.
In this paper, we characterize the optimization landscape of the Tucker
decomposition problem. In particular, we show that if the tensor has an exact
Tucker decomposition, for a standard nonconvex objective of Tucker
decomposition, all local minima are also globally optimal. We also give a local
search algorithm that can find an approximate local (and global) optimal
solution in polynomial time.

    <p>Dubious journal publisher MDPI provides special-issue editors with some number of no-publication-charge slots, but requires that priority for these slots be given to first-world scholars, because they are the ones with “more abundant scientific research resources” (read: funds to pay publication charges).

In a STOC 1976 paper, Schaefer proved that it is PSPACE-complete to determine the winner of the so-called Maker-Breaker game on a given set system, even when every set has size at most 11. Since then, there has been no improvement on this result. We prove that the game remains PSPACE-complete even when every set has size 6.</div>

<p>In order to assist organizers of other virtual conferences, the general chairs of STOC 2020 (myself, Konstantin Makarychev, Yury Makarychev and Madhur Tulsiani, with input from PC chair Julia Chuzhoy) wrote a detailed document describing the design and execution of the conference. I personally felt the conference went about as well as it could have gone, and despite many moving parts, there were minimal technical difficulties.</p>

<p>2020 sucks.</p>



<p>Yesterday I learned that <a href="https://www.cifar.ca/cifarnews/2020/06/18/a-quantum-festschrift-for-david-poulin">David Poulin</a>, a creative and widely-beloved quantum computing and information theorist, has died at age 43, of an aggressive brain cancer.  After studying under many of the field’s legends—Gilles Brassard, Wojciech Zurek, Ray Laflamme, Gerard Milburn, John Preskill—David became a professor at the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec.  There he played a leading role in CIFAR (the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research), eventually co-directing its quantum information science program with Aephraim Steinberg.  Just this fall (!), David moved to Microsoft Research to start a new phase of his career.  He’s survived by a large family.</p>



<p>While I can’t claim any deep knowledge of David’s work—he and I pursued very different problems—it seems appropriate to mention some of his best-known contributions.  With David Kribs, Ray Laflamme, and Maia Lesosky, he <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0504189">introduced</a> the formalism of operator quantum error correction, and made many other contributions to the theory of quantum error-correction and fault-tolerance (including the estimation of thresholds).  He and coauthors <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1147">showed</a> in a <em>Nature</em> paper how to do quantum state tomography on 1D matrix product states efficiently.  With Pavithran Iyer, he <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3235">proved</a> that optimal decoding of stabilizer codes is #P-hard.</p>



<p>And if none of that makes a sufficient impression on <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers: well, back in 2013, when D-Wave was claiming to have achieved huge quantum speedups, David Poulin was one of the few experts willing to take a clear skeptical stance in public (including right in my comment section—see <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1400#comment-79596">here</a> for example).</p>



<p>I vividly remember being officemates with David back in 2003, at the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo—before Perimeter had its sleek black building, when it still operated out of a converted tavern.  (My and David’s office was in the basement, reached via a narrow staircase.)  David liked to tease me: for example, if I found him in conversation with someone else and asked what it was about, he’d say, “oh, nothing to do with computational efficiency, no reason for you to care.”  (And yet, much of David’s work ultimately <em>would</em> have to do with computational efficiency.)</p>



<p>David was taken way too soon and will be missed by everyone who knew him.  Feel free to share David stories in the comments.</p></div>

Joshua Greene and Andrew Lobb <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09193.pdf">proved</a> last month that every <em>smooth</em> Jordan curve in the plane and real <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br+%5Cleq+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r \leq 1}" class="latex" title="{r \leq 1}" />, there are four points on the curve that form a rectangle with sides of ratio <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" />.</p>
<p>
Today we explain how this result relates to Otto Toeplitz’s famous “square peg conjecture,” which is the case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r = 1}" class="latex" title="{r = 1}" /> when the curve need not be smooth.</p>
<p>
We noticed this via an <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-geometric-perspective-cracks-old-problem-about-rectangles-20200625/">article</a> last Thursday by Kevin Hartnett for <em>Quanta</em>. Hartnett describes this research advance as a product of the pandemic inducing them to take time for deeper reflection on fundamental problems. We wonder how much is bubbling on hard problems in our own field—this is one reason for our last post’s <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/06/21/some-real-and-some-virtual-news">interest</a> in (good kinds of) “gossip.”  He also gives great diagrams for the geometrical intuition.</p>
<p>
We will portray this advance instead along lines of things we’ve said recently about how to attack hard problems by seeking and solving simpler ones or special cases as stepping stones. Dick wrote a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/10/21/the-inscribed-square-problem/">post</a> two years ago on the original Toeplitz problem, which this work still leaves open. That post focused on ways general Jordan curves can be nasty. This one needs an extra niceness condition but proves a stronger result for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" />. How much can progress on “nice” inform problems with “nasty”? That kind of question comes up in complexity theory all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Pegging Rectangles </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
A <em>Jordan curve</em> is the image of a continuous 1-1 map <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f}" class="latex" title="{f}" /> from the circle to the plane. The condition of being 1-1 prevents the image from intersecting itself, so it is a single closed loop. By the Jordan curve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_curve_theorem">theorem</a>, the loop always partitions the rest of the plane into two connected regions, exactly one of which is bounded. Amazingly, a Jordan curve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osgood_curve">can</a> have positive Lebesgue measure, yet cannot fill all of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathbb{R}^2}" class="latex" title="{\mathbb{R}^2}" />. Such curves can, however, approach the kind of space-filling curves defined by Giuseppe Peano, and thus have any Lebesgue density less than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />, as was noted also by William Osgood in his 1903 <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1986455.pdf">paper</a>.</p>
<p>
The Toeplitz conjecture is that every Jordan curve has four points that form a square. As noted in Dick’s post, the positive-area case is actually an easy yes-case. Nasty cases are where the curve is nowhere-differentiable with zero area. Thus far, the problem has been answered <em>yes</em> only in the presence of some uniformity condition that limits the local nastiness of the curve. The simplest one is for the curve to be <em>smooth</em> in that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f}" class="latex" title="{f}" /> has a continuous first derivative. Here is a smooth curve that is not convex, so that the square need not be “inside” the curve:</p>

<p>
This diagram is from Benjamin Matchske’s wonderful recent <a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/201404/rnoti-p346.pdf">survey</a> of the peg problem in the <em>AMS Notices</em>. Four months ago we’d have said it looks like a thin heart or fat boomerang. <i>Now</i> it looks to us like a face mask.</p>
<p>
As the survey notes, it is easy to show that every Jordan curve has <em>some</em> rectangle. The rectangle problem is to show that rectangles of <i>every</i> aspect ratio <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" /> can be pegged to the curve. There are two main reasons the square and rectangle problems are hard and harder:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Although any Jordan curve can be written as a limit of nice ones, the squares in the nice ones can degenerate to a single point in the limit. <p></p>
</li><li>
Even for nice curves, a parity property that holds for squares can fail for rectangles.
</li></ol>
<p>
The property in the second point enables arguments of the kind: <em>for generic curves the number of squares is odd, therefore it is nonzero</em>. This then carries over to sufficiently nice curves in the generic closure. The failure of this property for rectangles is a main reason the results by Greene and Lobb are new.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Paper </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The new paper is written tersely at a high level, and we must confess not being able to catch all details in compressed time. But we can highlight some aspects of the argument. First, as we have said, it exemplifies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Solve a Simpler Problem</em>.
</li></ul>
<p>
This is however coupled with a second aspect:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Bring Up the Reserves</em>.
</li></ul>
<p>
It may be that the rectangle conjecture is not only true but “equally true” in the sense that the fundamental reason applies equally well to the case of rectangles. The parity argument that works for cases involving squares may be a crutch that misses the deepest explanations. Promoting arguments that avoid this crutch may marshal resources needed to make a breakthrough on the main problem for completely general Jordan curves.</p>
<p>
This runs somewhat counter to what we have said about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" /> versus <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P}}" /> proof attempts recently. The reason for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" /> believed by most is that problems like SAT require <em>exponential</em> time, not just super-polynomial time. Yet no one knows even a <em>super-linear</em> lower bound, apart from barely-superlinear bounds that exploit grainy aspects of the multitape Turing machine model and apply only to it. Nor is any super-linear lower bound known on Boolean circuit size. Maybe it is a viable strategy also to “bring up reserves” by finding restricted cases where (conditional) exponential lower bounds can be proven, as well as to explore contingencies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_time_hypothesis">SETH</a>, as we covered <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/06/01/puzzling-evidence/">here</a>. But both of use have always felt that the super-linear frontier holds the buried keys to further progress.</p>
<p>
The Greene-Lobb proof has two aspects that may also resonate in complexity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Blow Up the Objects</em>.
</li></ul>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-geometric-perspective-cracks-old-problem-about-rectangles-20200625/">article</a> in <em>Quanta</em> has great diagrams illustrating how the set of pairs of points on the curve corresponds to a Möbius strip in a related space. Cole Hugelmeyer, a graduate student at Princeton, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07336.pdf">proved</a> last year how to get rectangles covering at least one-third of possible values <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br+%5Cin+%280%2C1%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r \in (0,1]}" class="latex" title="{r \in (0,1]}" /> by embedding the Möbius strips in a four-dimensional space. Intersections between a strip and a rotated copy yield rectangles on the original Jordan curve. </p>
<p>
That led Greene and Lobb to consider larger objects with properties like pairs of Möbius strips in the larger space. The Klein bottle is the natural next thing to consider and led to a feature of their proof that made the desired conclusion pop out:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Identify and Rule Out Obstructions</em>.
</li></ul>
<p>
The clever point pivots on the fact that a Klein bottle cannot be smoothly embedded into the complex plane <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathbb{C}^2}" class="latex" title="{\mathbb{C}^2}" /> as a Lagrangian submanifold. The proof shows that for any prescribed aspect ratio <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" /> one can construct a mapping that almost succeeds in embedding such a Klein bottle. The fact that it must fail means that the image must yield a point of intersection witnessing the failure. The presence of this point then yields the construction of four other points on the Jordan curve that form the vertices of the needed rectangle.</p>
<p>
We have briefly <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/06/06/princeton-is-invariant/">mentioned</a> how the concept of <em>obstructions</em> is integral to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_complexity_theory">Geometric</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1944345.1944346">Complexity</a> <a href="http://gct.cs.uchicago.edu/">Theory</a> attack on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" />. Closer to home, however, is how László Babai's graph isomorphism algorithm and proof works by identifying a subclass of graphs called Johnson graphs as obstructions to a simpler algorithm, as we highlighted <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2017/01/06/snow-and-theory/">here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Can you find more lessons from the new advance on the Toeplitz problem?  Dick and I have considered ideas of blowing up from languages to pairs of languages (and making <i>reductions</i> between problems the fundamental units of analysis) but this has not gone beyond dreamwork.</p>

<div class="content">
<br />
I was re-watching the  Greatest-of-all-time Jeopardy championship and the following happen (I paraphrase)<br />
<br />
----------------------<br />
Alex Trebek: The category is Chemistry and we have a special guest reading the clues.<br />
<br />
Darling: I wonder who that will be.<br />
<br />
Bill: Hmm. I assume some famous chemist.<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
So who was it? Bryan Cranston, the actor who PLAYED chemist Walter White on <i>Breaking Bad.</i><br />
<br />
Why couldn't they get a famous living chemist to read the clues?<br />
<br />
My guess: there are no famous living chemists.<br />
<br />
The number of famous living scientists is fairly short and they are often known for things that are not quite their science. Some are famous because the popularize science (deGrasse Tyson, Dawkins) or because of something unusual about their life (Hawkings when he was alive) or for something else entirely that they did (Ted Kaczynski).  Are any famous for the actual work that they do in the science?<br />
<br />
Andrew Wiles was famous for a brief time, and even made People Magazine's <i>25 most intriguing people of the year</i> list in the early 1990's (after he solved Fermat's Last Theorem). So he was famous but it was short lived.<br />
<br />
Terry Tao was on the Colbert Report (see <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/6wtwlg/the-colbert-report-terence-tao">here</a>) after he won the Fields Medal, the MacAuthor Genius award, and the Breakthrough prize. And even that fame was short lived.<br />
<br />
I looked at the web page of Nobel Prize winners, <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-prizes">here</a>.<br />
<br />
The only Chemistry Nobel's I recognized were Marie Curie,  Irene Joilet-Curie (Marie's Daughter), and Erst Rutherford.<br />
<br />
The only Physics Nobel's I recognized were<br />
<br />
Richard Feynman,<br />
<br />
 Eugene Wigner (for writing about <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html">The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences</a>),<br />
<br />
Richard Hofstadter (since he was the father of Douglas H and an uncle of Leonard H)<br />
<br />
 Andrew Geim (since he won  both an Ig-Noble prize and a Nobel prize, see  <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2010/10/noble-and-ig-noble-prizes.html">here</a>)<br />
<br />
Wolfgang Pauli (I've heard the term `Pauli Principle" though I did not know what it was until I looked it up while preparing this blog. I prob still don't really know what it means.)<br />
<br />
Enrico Fermi<br />
<br />
Erwin Schrodinger<br />
<br />
Paul Dirac<br />
<br />
Robert Millikan<br />
<br />
Albert Einstein<br />
<br />
Max Karl Ernest Ludwig Planck (I thought his last name was `Institute')<br />
<br />
Johannes Diderik van der Waals<br />
<br />
Pierre Curie<br />
<br />
Marie Curie<br />
<br />
<br />
So, some questions:<br />
<br />
a) Am I wrong? Are there famous living chemists I never heard of? Are there any famous living scientists who are famous for their work in science?<br />
<br />
b) If I am right then was there ever a time when there were famous scientists?<br />
<br />
c) If there was such a time, what changed?<br />
<br />
(I ask all of this non-rhetorically and with no agenda to push.)<br />
<br />

<div class="content">
<p>I’m giving a keynote address at the <a href="https://www.ifac2020.org/">virtual IFAC congress this July</a>, and I submitted an abstract that forces me to reflect on the current state of research at the intersection of machine learning and control. 2020 is particularly appropriate for reflection: For personal reasons, I’ve been working in this space for about half a decade now and <a href="https://www.argmin.net/2018/06/25/outsider-rl/">wrote a blog series on the topic two years ago</a> and it seemed like ideal timing. For the broader community, 2020 happens to be the year we were promised fleets of self-driving cars. Of course, for a myriad of reasons, we’re nowhere close to achieving this goal. Full self-driving has been a key motivator of work in learning-enabled autonomous systems, and it’s important to note this example as a marker of how difficult problems this space really are.</p>

<p>The research community has come to terms with this difficulty, and has committed itself to address the many pressing challenges. Over the last year I attended several great meetings on this topic, including an <a href="https://ajwagen.github.io/adsi_learning_and_control/">NSF funded workshop at UW</a>, a plenary session at <a href="https://ita.ucsd.edu/ws/">ITA</a>, a workshop on intersections of <a href="https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/intersections-between-control-learning-and-optimization/?tab=overview">learning, control, and optimization at IPAM</a>, and the <a href="https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/l4dc/home">second annual conference on Learning for Dynamics and Control</a>. There is clearly a ton of enthusiasm from researchers in a many different disciplines, and we’re seeing fascinating results mixing techniques from machine learning, computer science, and control. Obviously, I’m going to be leaving out many incredible papers, but, focusing on the theoretical end of the spectrum, perhaps I could highlight <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11899">new work on policy optimization</a> that demonstrates how simple optimization techniques can efficiently solve classic, nonconvex control-design problems or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721">work connecting regret minimization and adaptive control</a> that provides nonasymptotic bounds.</p>

<p>This work has been very useful for establishing language to bridge communication between the diverse research camps interested in the space of learning, dynamics and automation. But, as I’ll discuss shortly, I’d argue that it hasn’t provided many promising approaches to improving large-scale autonomy. That’s ok! These problems are incredibly difficult and aren’t going to be solved by wishing for them to be solved. But I also think it might be worth taking a moment to reflect on which problems we are working on. It’s always a bit too easy for theorists to focus  on improving technical results and lose sight of why someone proved those results in the first place.</p>

<p>As an illustrative example, my research group spent a lot of time studying the <a href="http://www.argmin.net/2018/02/08/lqr/">Linear Quadratic Regulator</a> (LQR). The point of this work was initially to establish baselines: LQR has a closed form solution when the model is known, so we wanted to understand how different algorithms might perform when the underlying model was unknown. It turns out that if you are willing to collect enough data, the best thing you can do for LQR is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07826">estimate the dynamical model, and then exploit this model as if it were true</a>. This so-called “certainty equivalent control” is what practitioners have been doing since the mid-60s to fly satellites and solve other optimal control problems. Proving this result required a bunch of new mathematical insights that established connections between high dimensional statistics and automatic control theory. But it did not bring us closer to solving new challenges in robotics or autonomous systems. Our work here merely showed that what the controls community had been doing for 50 years was already about as well as we could do for this important baseline problem.</p>

<p>So what are the ways forward? Are there things that theory-minded folks can work on short term that might help us understand paths towards improving learning systems in complex feedback loops? Let me suggest a few challenges that I see as both very pressing, but also ones where we might be able to make near-term progress.</p>

<h2 id="machine-learning-is-still-not-reliable-technology">Machine Learning is still not reliable technology</h2>

<p>At the aforementioned <a href="https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/intersections-between-control-learning-and-optimization/?tab=overview">IPAM meeting</a>, Richard Murray gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wi8Y---ce28">fantastic survey of the sorts of standards of reliability imposed in aerospace engineering</a>. Go watch it! I don’t want to spoil it for you, but his discussion of Ram Air Turbines is gripping. Richard covers what is needed to get to the sorts of reliability we’d like in autonomous systems. Unfortunately, having <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08237">88.5% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet</a>—while a stunning achievement—doesn’t tell us how to get to systems with failure rates on the order of 1 in a billion. As Boeing has tragically shown, cutting corners on autonomous system safety standards has horrible, tragic consequences.</p>

<p>How can we make machine learning more robust? How can we approach the failure rates needed for safe, reliable autonomy? And how can we establish testing protocols to assure we have such low failure rates?</p>

<h2 id="prediction-systems-in-feedback-loops">Prediction systems in feedback loops</h2>

<p>One particular aspect that I think is worth considering is how supervised learning systems can function as “sensors” in feedback loops. Even if you know everything about a dynamical system, when you observe the state via an estimator generated by a learned component, it’s not clear how to best take action on this observation. Most classic control and planning assumes that your errors in state-estimation are Gaussian or nicely uniformly bounded. Of course, the errors from machine learning systems are neither of these (I recommend checking out the <a href="https://youtu.be/A0cb7wZVFf4">crazy videos</a> of the <a href="https://twitter.com/greentheonly/status/1130956365063761920">confusion</a> that comes out of Tesla Autopilot’s vision systems). How to properly characterize the errors of machine learning systems for control applications seems like a useful, understudied problem. Using off-the-shelf machine learing analysis, it’s unavoidable to have to densely sample all of the possible scenarios in advance in order to guarantee the sort of uniform error bounds desired by control algorithms. This isn’t practical, and, indeed, it’s clear that this sort of sensor characterization is not needed to make reasonable demos work. Though it’s a bit mundane, I think a huge contribution lies in understanding how much data we need to quantify the uncertainty in learned perception components. It’s still not clear to me if this is a machine learning question or a closed-loop design question, and I suspect both views of the problem will be needed to make progress.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-we-all-sleeping-on-model-predictive-control">Why are we all sleeping on model predictive control?</h2>

<p>I still remain baffled by how <a href="http://www.argmin.net/2018/05/02/adp/">model predictive control</a> (MPC) is consistently under appreciated. We’ll commonly see the same tasks in the same meeting, one task done on a robot using some sort of deep reinforcement learning and the other done using model predictive control, and the disparity in performance is stark. It’s like the difference between watching an Olympic level sprinter and me jogging in my neighborhood with a set of orthotics.</p>

<p>Here’s an example from the IPAM workshop. Martin Riedmiller presented work at DeepMind to catch a ball in a cup:</p>



<p>This system uses two cameras, has a rather large “cup,” (it’s a wastepaper basket) and yet still takes 3 days to train on the robot. Francesco Borrelli presented a different approach. Using only a single camera and basic, simple Newtonian physics, and MPC they were able to achieve this performance on the standard-sized “ball-in-a-cup” toy:</p>



<p>If you only saw these two videos, I can’t fathom why would you invest all of your assets into deep RL. I understand there are still a lot of diehards out there, and I know this will offend them. But I want to make a constructive point: so many theorists are spending a lot of time studying RL algorithms, but few in the ML community are analyzing MPC and why it’s so successful. We should rebalance our allocation of mental resources!</p>

<p>Now, while the basic idea of MPC is very simple, the theory gets very hairy very quickly. It definitely takes some time and effort to learn about how to prove convergence of MPC protocols. I’d urge the MPC crowd to connect more with the learning theory crowd to see if a common ground can be found to better understand how MPC works and how we might push its performance even farther.</p>

<h2 id="perhaps-we-should-stop-taking-cues-from-alphago">Perhaps we should stop taking cues from AlphaGo?</h2>

<p>One of the grand goals in RL is to use function approximation algorithms to estimate value functions. The conventional wisdom asserts that the world is a giant Markov Decision Process and once you have its value function, you can just greedily maximize it and you’ll win at life. Now, this sort of approach clearly doesn’t work for robots, and I’m perplexed by why people still think it will work at all. Part of the motivation is that this approach was used to solve Go. But at some point I think we all have to come to terms with the fact that games are not the real world.</p>

<p>Now, I’d actually argue that RL <em>does</em> work in the real world, but it’s in systems that most people don’t actively think of as RL systems. Greedy value function estimation and exploitation is <em>literally</em> how all internet revenue is made. Systems simply use past data to estimate value functions and then choose the action that maximizes the value at the next step. Though seldom described as such, these are instances of the “greedy contextual bandit” algorithm, and this algorithm makes tech companies tons of money. But many researchers have also pointed out that this algorithm leads to misinformation, polarization, and radicalization.</p>

<p>Everyone tries to motivate RL by the success of AlphaGo, but they should be using the success of Facebook and Google instead. And if they did this, I think it would be a lot more clear why RL is terrifying and dangerous, and one whose limitations we desperately need to understand so that we can build safer tools.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-from-the-70s-about-optimal-control">Lessons from the 70s about optimal control</h2>

<p>I have one set of ideas along these lines that, while I think is important, I still am having a hard time articulating. Indeed, I might just take a few blog posts to work through my thoughts on this, but let me close this blog with a teaser of discussions to come. As I mentioned above, optimal control was a guiding paradigm for a variety of control applications in the 60s and 70s. During this time, it seemed like there might even be hidden benefits to a full-on optimization paradigm: though you’d optimize a single, simple objective, you would often get additional robustness guarantees for free. However, it turned out that this was very misleading and that <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1101812">there were no guarantees of robustness even for simple optimal control problems</a>. This shouldn’t be too surprising, as if you devote a lot of resources towards one objective, you are likely neglecting some other objective. But showing how and why these fragilities arise is quite delicate. It’s not always obvious how you <em>should</em> be devoting your resources.</p>

<p>Trying to determine how to allocate engineering resources to balance safety and performance is the heart of “robust control.” One thing I’m fascinated by moving forward is if any of the early developments in robust control might transfer over for a new kind of “robust ML.” Unfortunately for all of us, robust control is a rather encrypted literature. There is a lot of mathematics, but often not clear statements about <em>why</em> we study particular problems or what are the fundamental limits of feedback. While diligent young learning theorists have been scouring classic control theory text books for insights, these books don’t always articulate what we can and cannot do and what are the problems that control theory might help solve. We still have a lot of work to do in communicating what we know and what problems remain challenging. I think it would be useful for control theorists to think of how to best communicate the fundamental concepts of robust control. I hope to take up this challenge in the next few months on this blog.</p>

<p><em>I’d like to thank Sarah Dean, Horia Mania, Nik Matni, and Ludwig Schmidt for their helpful feedback on this post. I’d also like to thank John Doyle for several inspiring conversations about robustness in optimal control and on the encrypted state of the control theory literature.</em></p></div>

<p>Here’s a cute exercise for the next time you’re teaching radix sorting in an algorithms class:</p>

<p>Suppose you’re given as input a set of real numbers , and an integer parameter . Describe an algorithm for sorting the  numbers  in time . You can assume that standard arithmetic operations on real numbers (including comparisons and rounding down to an integer) take constant time per operation.</p>

<p>Models of computation that mix constant-time real arithmetic and rounding operations can be problematic, as by building up and then rounding numbers with unlimited precision you can access a level of computational power beyond what actual computers can do, but I don’t think that’s a concern here. If someone wants to use bit-packing tricks to implement a crazy but fast sorting algorithm in this model, they’re beyond the level of this exercise.</p>

<p>The same method (which I’m not going to describe, to preserve its value as an exercise) more generally allows you to take as input pairs  and sort the numbers  in time  where . But it relies heavily on the fact that you’re adding integers to the ’s. For a problem that can’t be handled in this way, consider instead sorting the numbers  where we multiply instead of adding. Or, if you prefer to view this as a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_%2B_Y_sorting"> sorting</a> problem, take logs in your favorite base and sort the numbers . It’s not at all obvious to me whether this can be done in the same  time bound.</p>

<p>The motivation for looking at all this is <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/47120/95">a question about how to implement the greedy set cover quickly</a>. You can find the unweighted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_cover_problem#Greedy_algorithm">greedy set cover</a> in linear time (linear in the sum of the sizes of the input sets; this is an exercise in CLRS), and you can approximate the weighted greedy set cover very accurately in linear time using similar ideas. If you could sort  quickly you could use the sorted order to compute the weighted greedy set cover exactly in the same time as the sorting algorithm. Which is totally useless because the greedy cover is already an approximation, so a fast and accurate approximation to the greedy cover is good enough. But I think the question of sorting  is interesting despite its uselessness in this application.</p>

The STOC workshop on Algorithms with Predictions was on Friday, and I thought it went really well!  I can't speak for my talk, but the other 3 talks (Tim Roughgarden, Edith Cohen, Ravi Kumar) were fantastic and inspiring, and I really recommend them for anyone with an interest in "Beyond Worst-Case Analysis".   <br /><br />The talks are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKYJwN6XKw&amp;feature=youtu.be">all on Youtube</a>.  And the <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~vakilian/stoc-workshop.html">workshop page</a> is full of useful links and information.</div>

<p>Sorry for the long blog silence. In this post I wish to give a few links each of which probably deserves a full post. I will start with</p>
<h2>Rani Sharim’s two-player variants of John Conway’s game-of-life</h2>
<p><a href="https://ranisharim.github.io/game_of_life_2_players/">Here is a web-page</a> by a student in my “Game Theory” course where you can play several two-players variants of John Conway’s game-of-life.  (A couple of variants were considered before. See, e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0207679">this  paper</a>.)</p>
<p>I really enjoyed playing Rani’s games and it can certainly cheer you up in difficult times. Questions about the game, remarks, and suggestions for improvements and for new features, are most welcome.</p>
<h2>How to catch lies with statistics, a 2006  presentation by Maya Bar-Hillel</h2>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/mayesther.png"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/mayesther.png?w=640" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19929" /></a></p>
<p>Maya Bar-Hillel (left) and Ester Samuel-Cahn</p>
<p>Here is an interesting 2006 <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/ester.ppt">power point presentation entitled <strong><em>How to detect lies with statistics</em></strong> by Maya Bar-Hillel.</a>  This was a talk given by Maya at the <a href="http://www.esterconference.huji.ac.il/">conference</a> honoring Prof. Ester Samuel- Cahn , Jerusalem, December 18-20, 2006, and it described a planned research project of Maya Bar-Hillel with Yossi Rinott, David Budescu and myself. At the end we did not pursue it, mainly because each of us was involved in various other projects (but also because we were skeptical about some aspects of it.)  Ester Samuel-Cahn (1933-2015) was a famous Israeli statistician. (Here is a <a href="http://www.sci-princess.info/archives/291">post by Yosi Levy in Hebrew</a> about the conference and about Ester.)</p>
<p>The lecture starts with “Last year, <em>Statistical Science</em> celebrated 50 years for `How to Lie with Statistics’ the book [by Durell Huff] whose title inspired this talk.”</p>
<p>And here are a few other quotes from Maya’s presentation</p>
<p>“We are not sure a general toolkit for detecting lies with statistics can be developed. Perhaps that explains why none yet exists.  We have shown just a collection of anecdotes. But they can be classified and categorized. Some do seem generalizeable, at least to some extent.”</p>
<p>and the conclusion</p>
<blockquote><p>A famous quip by Fred Mosteller: “It is easy to lie with statistics, but easier to lie without them.”</p>
<p>Likewise, we should say:  “It is possible to detect (some) lies with statistics, but easier to detect them with other means”.</p></blockquote>
<h2>New bounds for Ryser’s conjecture and related problems</h2>
<p>Peter Keevash, Alexey Pokrovskiy, Benny Sudakov, and Liana Yepremyan’s paper  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00526">New bounds for Ryser’s conjecture and related problems,</a> describes remarkable progress very old questions regarding transversals in Latin square.</p>
<h2>Topological Tverberg news</h2>
<p>I came across a very interesting paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05251">The topological Tverberg problem beyond <span class="search-hit mathjax">prime</span> powers</a> by Florian Frick and Pablo Soberón with new bounds and a new method for topological Tverberg theorem in the non prime-power case.</p>
<h2>Jeager’s conjecture refuted</h2>
<p>A year ago I came across <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2114324995342352&amp;set=a.507523926022475&amp;type=3&amp;theater">this cool facebook post</a> by Rupei Xu</p>
<blockquote><p>OMG! Just learned that Jaeger’s conjecture is false for every t&gt;=3. An interesting consequence of it is that a specific version of Goddyn’s conjecture on thin spanning trees is false, which shows some negative evidence that the thin spanning tree approaches may fail to lead to a constant factor approximation algorithm for ATSP!</p></blockquote>
<h2>A cool rainbow post <a href="http://matroidunion.org/?p=2541">Short rainbow cycles in graphs and matroids</a> by Tony Huynh</h2>
<h2>More on the game of life</h2>
<p>Let me mention two problems I posted 6-7 years ago about Conway’s game of life. <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/132402/conways-game-of-life-for-random-initial-position" class="question-hyperlink">Conway’s game of life for random initial position</a> and <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/17914/does-a-noisy-version-of-conways-game-of-life-support-universal-computation" class="question-hyperlink">Does a noisy version of Conway’s game of life support universal computation?</a></p>

This post both relates to some of the stuff I'll be presenting at Friday's STOC workshop on Algorithms with Predictions, but is also for future students in my classes, who sometimes wonder why I have them write code on theory material.  (Somehow this might be a theme for a lecture in my grad class next semester, so maybe these are a first attempt at notes for the lecture.  Comments  and  suggestions welcome.)<br /><br />Some of the work I'm doing is looking at how queueing systems perform with various sorts of predictions on the times the jobs take.  This particular work I'm doing on my own.  (While most of my research has been and is with collaborators, and it's one of the things I enjoy about computer science -- we're a very collaborative field!, which seems to surprise many people -- I still sometimes like to do research projects on my own.  I've looked at queueing systems since my PhD thesis, and it's a bit outside the research interest of most of my collaborator pool, and it's "fun" sometimes to do my own thing.  The reason why "fun" is in quotes is described below.)  <br /><br />Often in my work in queueing I'm looking at mean-field limits (meant to model infinite systems of queues, which provides a good approximation for large finite systems under reasonable assumptions), where I can derive families of differential equations describing the system behavior.  I can also simulate the large finite system directly, and make sure the results match.  I generally do this for all of these types of papers.<br /><br />Now the numbers I get from simulating the system directly and from simulating the differential equations should match (say within 1% or so).  If they don't, something is wrong.  In an effort to avoid wrongness, I won't consider the paper ready for outside consumption until I get a match.  Unfortunately, there are three ways things can go wrong.<br /><br />1.  My simulation code for the queueing system might have bugs.<br />2.  My code to evaluate the differential equations might have bugs.<br />3.  My equations themselves might have bugs.<br /><br />And I find there are two main categories of bugs.  Sometimes the bugs are simple/standard coding mistakes -- I'm off by 1 on an index, or I cut and paste and forget to change an i++ to a j++ in one my double loops, or I type x instead of a y.  Usually it's pretty easy to find these things, although I've had times where a hidden typo took hours to find.  But sometimes the bug is a thinking mistake -- I've forgotten a subcase and so my equations aren't complete (and so my code evaluating the equations won't give the right answer), or I've not handled a subcase correctly in my simulation.  That type usually takes longer. <br /><br />Usually, the first time through, most all of these types of bugs happen -- my math is off, I've typed some stuff wrong, it can all happen.  And then, like coders everywhere, I go through and fix it.  And it's painful.  Sometimes everything goes right, a quick check or two and everything works.  For more complicated stuff, it's more time figuring out what went wrong than setting up the code to begin with.  And being the personality type to not let things sit, that can mean late nights figuring out what went wrong.<br /><br />For my talk this week, there was one last problem I wanted to include, which meant finally taking the model and writing the equations and code.  I didn't even need it for the talk, but it's also the last bit before I put a paper draft on arxiv, so taking advantage of a deadline, I figured now was the time.  Which means the last 2 days, I've spent many hours (and a late night) trying to remove the disagreements.<br /><br />On the plus side, when everything finally works, it's a wonderful feeling.  And it always makes me feel better when I have worked to verify my math this way;  this time, what kept me up well past midnight and took several hours to track down was actually a boundary case I had left out of the equations.  (I had looked at the equations over and over again without noticing I had left out the subcase;  I had to step through numbers from the differential equations one time step at a time to track down what was missing, and then the numbers told me what I had done wrong.)<br /><br />On the down side, it's work, and debugging is never particularly fun.<br /><br />For students out there, maybe I'm just explaining that I understand the pain that I am putting you through.  You may wonder why I have you do simulations that take a few hours if you do them well, but days if you don't think through the best approach.  But using programming and theory together can be powerful;  it's helped me countless times in my research.<br /><br />(Related: on theory and experiments that <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/9/191184-theory-without-experiments/fulltext">I've written on before</a>, along with <a
