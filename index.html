<p>Like many academics, I’ve now been regularly “attending” conferences and giving talks via Zoom for four months.  Naturally, I’ve learned a lot about how to use this platform—one that, despite numerous quirks and flaws, <em>actually works</em> well enough that it could probably replace at least 2/3 of in-person talks and meetings after the covid crisis is over.  But one particular lesson is so important that I thought I’d make a public service announcement of it.  So without further ado:</p>



<p><strong>Email the link.</strong></p>



<p>You know, the thing like</p>



<p>https://us02web.zoom.us/jblahblah</p>



<p>that you actually click to get to the actual conversation.  <em>Definitely</em> email the link to the speaker (!).  But also email it to whomever said they plan to attend.  Resend the link between a day and an hour in advance, so that it doesn’t get buried, but turns up right away when people search their inboxes.  If possible, put the link in <em>every single email</em> about the meeting or lecture.  Even if you already sent the link for previous iterations of the meeting and it hasn’t changed, send it again.  Don’t assume people will find the link on the web.  Don’t make them click through five other links or open an attached PDF for it.  Don’t send ten emails that explain every possible detail of the meeting except how to get to it.  Just <strong>email the link.</strong>  That’s all.  Thanks!</p></div>

showed that if the union of supply and demand graphs is planar, then the cut
condition is sufficient for routing demands. Okamura-Seymour showed that if all
demands are incident on one face, then again cut condition is sufficient for
routing demands. We consider a common generalization of these settings where
the end points of each demand are on the same face of the planar graph. We show
that if the source sink pairs on each face of the graph are such that sources
and sinks appear contiguously on the cycle bounding the face, then the flow cut
gap is at most 3. We come up with a notion of approximating demands on a face
by convex combination of laminar demands to prove this result.

maximizing $x^TAx$ subject to the constraint $x \in \{-1,1\}^n$. This problem,
called MaxQP by Charikar and Wirth [FOCS'04], generalizes MaxCut and has
natural applications in data clustering and in the study of disordered magnetic
phases of matter. Charikar and Wirth showed that the problem admits an
$\Omega(1/\lg n)$ approximation via semidefinite programming, and Alon,
Makarychev, Makarychev, and Naor [STOC'05] showed that the same approach yields
an $\Omega(1)$ approximation when $A$ corresponds to a graph of bounded
chromatic number. Both these results rely on solving the semidefinite
relaxation of MaxQP, whose currently best running time is
$\tilde{O}(n^{1.5}\cdot \min\{N,n^{1.5}\})$, where $N$ is the number of nonzero
entries in $A$ and $\tilde{O}$ ignores polylogarithmic factors.
</p>
<p>In this sequel, we abandon the semidefinite approach and design purely
combinatorial approximation algorithms for special cases of MaxQP where $A$ is
sparse (i.e., has $O(n)$ nonzero entries). Our algorithms are superior to the
semidefinite approach in terms of running time, yet are still competitive in
terms of their approximation guarantees. More specifically, we show that:
</p>
<p>- UnitMaxQP, where $A \in \{-1,0,1\}^{n\times n}$, admits an
$(1/3d)$-approximation in $O(n^{1.5})$ time, when the corresponding graph has
no isolated vertices and at most $dn$ edges.
</p>
<p>- MaxQP admits an $\Omega(1/\lg a_{\max})$-approximation in $O(n^{1.5} \lg
a_{\max})$ time, where $a_{\max}$ is the maximum absolute value in $A$, when
the corresponding graph is $d$-degenerate.
</p>
<p>- MaxQP admits a $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation in $O(n)$ time when the
corresponding graph has bounded local treewidth.
</p>
<p>- UnitMaxQP admits a $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation in $O(n^2)$ time when
the corresponding graph is $H$-minor-free.

Existing low depth algorithms do not guarantee that the work remains
asymptotically the same for any constant-sized pattern. By using a connection
to certain separating cycles, our subgraph isomorphism algorithm can decide the
vertex connectivity of a planar graph (with high probability) in asymptotically
near-linear work and poly-logarithmic depth. Previously, no sub-quadratic work
and poly-logarithmic depth bound was known in planar graphs (in particular for
distinguishing between four-connected and five-connected planar graphs).

to total variation distance between any two log-concave distributions that
complements the reach of Talagrand T2 inequality. Moreover, applying this new

state-of-the-art convergence rates for sampling from a constrained log-concave

algorithms for the $k$-means problem to the setting with outliers.
</p>
<p>Recently, Bhaskara et al. (NeurIPS 2019) showed how to adapt the classical
$k$-means++ algorithm to the setting with outliers. However, their algorithm
needs to output $O(\log (k) \cdot z)$ outliers, where $z$ is the number of true
outliers, to match the $O(\log k)$-approximation guarantee of $k$-means++. In
this paper, we build on their ideas and show how to adapt several sequential
and distributed $k$-means algorithms to the setting with outliers, but with
substantially stronger theoretical guarantees: our algorithms output
$(1+\varepsilon)z$ outliers while achieving an $O(1 /
\varepsilon)$-approximation to the objective function. In the sequential world,
we achieve this by adapting a recent algorithm of Lattanzi and Sohler (ICML
2019). In the distributed setting, we adapt a simple algorithm of Guha et al.
(IEEE Trans. Know. and Data Engineering 2003) and the popular $k$-means$\|$ of
Bahmani et al. (PVLDB 2012).
</p>
<p>A theoretical application of our techniques is an algorithm with running time
$\tilde{O}(nk^2/z)$ that achieves an $O(1)$-approximation to the objective
function while outputting $O(z)$ outliers, assuming $k \ll z \ll n$. This is
complemented with a matching lower bound of $\Omega(nk^2/z)$ for this problem
in the oracle model.

an important cryptographic parameter that should be computed by fast
algorithms. They work in two main ways: (1) by computing the algebraic normal
form and then searching the monomial of the highest degree in it, or (2) by
examination the algebraic properties of the true table vector of a given
function. We have already done four basic steps in the study of the first way,
and the second one has been studied by other authors. Here we represent a
method for fast computing (the fastest way we know) the algebraic degree of
Boolean functions. It is a combination of the most efficient components of
these two ways and the corresponding algorithms. The theoretical time
complexities of the method are derived in each of the cases when the Boolean
function is represented in a byte-wise or in a bitwise manner. They are of the
same type $\Theta(n.2^n)$ for a Boolean function of $n$ variables, but they
have big differences between the constants in $\Theta$-notation. The
theoretical and experimental results shown here demonstrate the advantages of
the bitwise approach in computing the algebraic degree - they are dozens of
times faster than the byte-wise approaches.

arbitrary graph $G$, and that enumerate in output all the (inclusion-wise)
maximal "subgraphs" of $G$ which fulfil a given property $\Pi$. All over this
paper, we study several different properties $\Pi$, and the notion of subgraph
under consideration (induced or not) will vary from a result to another.
</p>
<p>More precisely, we present efficient algorithms to list all maximal split
subgraphs, sub-cographs and some subclasses of cographs of a given input graph.
All the algorithms presented here run in polynomial delay, and moreover for
split graphs it only requires polynomial space. In order to develop an
algorithm for maximal split (edge-)subgraphs, we establish a bijection between
the maximal split subgraphs and the maximal independent sets of an auxiliary
graph. For cographs and some subclasses , the algorithms rely on a framework
recently introduced by Conte &amp; Uno called Proximity Search. Finally we consider
the extension problem, which consists in deciding if there exists a maximal
induced subgraph satisfying a property $\Pi$ that contains a set of prescribed
vertices and that avoids another set of vertices. We show that this problem is
NP-complete for every "interesting" hereditary property $\Pi$. We extend the
hardness result to some specific edge version of the extension problem.

and Error Correcting Code (ECC). In the first problem, two parties hold two
strings, and one party tries to learn the other party's string through
communication. In the second problem, one party tries to send a message to
another party through a noisy channel, by adding some redundant information to
protect the message. Two important goals in both problems are to minimize the
communication complexity or redundancy, and to design efficient protocols or
codes.
</p>
<p>Both problems have been studied extensively. In this paper we study whether
asymmetric partial information can help in these two problems. We focus on the
case of Hamming distance/errors, and the asymmetric partial information is
modeled by one party having a vector of disjoint subsets $\vec{S}=(S_1, \cdots,
S_t)$ of indices and a vector of integers $\vec{k}=(k_1, \cdots, k_t)$, such
that in each $S_i$ the Hamming distance/errors is at most $k_i$. We establish
both lower bounds and upper bounds in this model, and provide efficient
randomized constructions that achieve a $\min\lbrace O(t^2), O\left((\log \log
n)^2\right) \rbrace $ factor within the optimum, with almost linear running
time.
</p>
<p>We further show a connection between the above document exchange problem and
the problem of document exchange under edit distance, and use our techniques to
give an efficient randomized protocol with optimal communication complexity and
\emph{exponentially} small error for the latter. This improves the previous
result by Haeupler \cite{haeupler2018optimal} (FOCS'19) and that by Belazzougui
and Zhang \cite{BelazzouguiZ16} (FOCS'16). Our techniques are based on a
generalization of the celebrated expander codes by Sipser and Spielman
\cite{sipser1996expander}, which may be of independent interests.

and an important step in geometry processing is to remove these noise
components from these surfaces (given as points-set or triangulated mesh). The
noise-removal process (denoising) can be performed by filtering the surface
normals first and by adjusting the vertex positions according to filtered
normals afterwards. Therefore, in many available denoising algorithms, the
computation of noise-free normals is a key factor. A variety of filters have
been introduced for noise-removal from normals, with different focus points
like robustness against outliers or large amplitude of noise. Although these
filters are performing well in different aspects, a unified framework is
missing to establish the relation between them and to provide a theoretical
analysis beyond the performance of each method.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we introduce such a framework to establish relations between a
number of widely-used nonlinear filters for face normals in mesh denoising and
vertex normals in point set denoising. We cover robust statistical estimation
with M-smoothers and their application to linear and non-linear normal
filtering. Although these methods originate in different mathematical theories
- which include diffusion-, bilateral-, and directional curvature-based
algorithms - we demonstrate that all of them can be cast into a unified
framework of robust statistics using robust error norms and their corresponding
influence functions. This unification contributes to a better understanding of
the individual methods and their relations with each other. Furthermore, the
presented framework provides a platform for new techniques to combine the
advantages of known filters and to compare them with available methods.

implementation allows the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and Shor's algorithm
to be performed on a $D$-dimensional lattice in time logarithmic in the number
of qubits for interactions with $\alpha \le D$. As a corollary, we show that
power-law systems with $\alpha \le D$ are difficult to simulate classically
even for short times, under a standard assumption that factoring is classically
intractable. Complementarily, we develop a new technique to give a general
lower bound, linear in the size of the system, on the time required to
implement the QFT and the fanout gate in systems that are constrained by a
linear light cone. This allows us to prove an asymptotically tighter lower
bound for long-range systems than is possible with previously available
techniques.

the generalization of newly appeared G-SGD algorithm to more practical network
is hindered. The Basis Path Set Searching problem is formulated from the
perspective of graph theory, to find the basis path set in a regular
complicated neural network. Our paper aims to discover the underlying cause of
path dependency between two independent substructures. Algorithm DEAH is
designed to solve the Basis Path Set Searching problem by eliminating such path
dependency. The path subdivision chain is proposed to effectively eliminate the
path dependency inside the chain and between chains. The theoretical proofs and
analysis of polynomial time complexity are presented. The paper therefore
provides one methodology to find the basis path set in a more general neural
network, which offers theoretical and algorithmic support for the application
of G-SGD algorithm in more practical scenarios.

<p>Going directly from undergraduate to Ph.D can be a good idea for many students interested in research, but it’s not the only route or the best choice for everyone.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2018/02/20/research-masters/">I wrote before</a>, for students that discovered their interest in theoretical CS late in their undergrad, or perhaps after they graduated, a research Masters, can be a great option. This is particularly the case if the program is funded (i.e., students get a stipend and don’t need to pay tuition). Such programs are not common in the U.S., but there are some excellent choices around the world.</p>

of recovering, given two graphs, a one-to-one mapping between nodes that
maximizes edge overlap. This problem can be viewed as a noisy version of the
well-known graph isomorphism problem and appears in many applications,
including social network deanonymization and cellular biology. Our focus here
is on partial recovery, i.e., we look for a one-to-one mapping which is correct
on a fraction of the nodes of the graph rather than on all of them, and we
assume that the two input graphs to the problem are correlated Erd\"os-R\'enyi
graphs of parameters $(n,q,s)$. Our main contribution is then to give necessary
and sufficient conditions on $(n,q,s)$ under which partial recovery is possible
with high probability as the number of nodes $n$ goes to infinity. These
conditions are compact, easily interpretable, and cover a vast majority of the
parameter space.

$f(X):=\tilde{f}(X)\bmod p$ factorizes into $n$ distinct linear factors over
$\mathbb{F}_p$. We study the problem of deterministically factoring $f(X)$ over
$\mathbb{F}_p$ given $\tilde{f}(X)$. Under the generalized Riemann hypothesis
(GRH), we give an improved deterministic algorithm that computes the complete
factorization of $f(X)$ in the case that the Galois group of $\tilde{f}(X)$ is
(permutation isomorphic to) a linear group $G\leq \mathrm{GL}(V)$ on the set
$S$ of roots of $\tilde{f}(X)$, where $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space
over a finite field $\mathbb{F}$ and $S$ is identified with a subset of $V$. In
particular, when $|S|=|V|^{\Omega(1)}$, the algorithm runs in time polynomial
in $n^{\log n/(\log\log\log\log n)^{1/3}}$ and the size of the input, improving
Evdokimov's algorithm. Our result also applies to a general Galois group $G$
when combined with a recent algorithm of the author.
</p>
<p>To prove our main result, we introduce a family of objects called linear
$m$-schemes and reduce the problem of factoring $f(X)$ to a combinatorial
problem about these objects. We then apply techniques from additive
combinatorics to obtain an improved bound. Our techniques may be of independent
interest.

weight and cost of a solid part. Currently, most infill structure generation
methods are based on the conventional 2.5-axis printing configuration, which,
although able to satisfy the self-supporting condition on the infills, suffer
from the well-known stair-case effect on the finished surface and the need of
extensive support for overhang features. In this paper, based on the emerging
continuous multi-axis printing configuration, we present a new lattice infill
structure generation algorithm, which is able to achieve both the
self-supporting condition for the infills and the support-free requirement at
the boundary surface of the part. The algorithm critically relies on the use of
three mutually orthogonal geodesic distance fields that are embedded in the
tetrahedral mesh of the solid model. The intersection between the iso-geodesic
distance surfaces of these three geodesic distance fields naturally forms the
desired lattice of infill structure, while the density of the infills can be
conveniently controlled by adjusting the iso-values. The lattice infill pattern
in each curved slicing layer is trimmed to conform to an Eulerian graph so to
generate a continuous printing path, which can effectively reduce the nozzle
retractions during the printing process. In addition, to cater to the
collision-free requirement and to improve the printing efficiency, we also
propose a printing sequence optimization algorithm for determining a
collision-free order of printing of the connected lattice infills, which seeks
to reduce the air-move length of the nozzle. Ample experiments in both computer
simulation and physical printing are performed, and the results give a
preliminary confirmation of the advantages of our methodology.

psychometric parameters. Most applications used myopic one-step ahead strategy
which only optimizes the immediate utility. The widely held expectation is that
global optimization strategies that explicitly optimize over some horizon can
largely improve the performance of the myopic strategy. With limited studies
that compared myopic and global strategies, the expectation was not challenged
and researchers are still investing heavily to achieve global optimization. Is
that really worthwhile? This paper provides a discouraging answer based on
experimental simulations comparing the performance improvement and computation
burden between global and myopic strategies in parameter estimation of multiple
models. The finding is that the added horizon in global strategies has
negligible contributions to the improvement of optimal global utility other
than the most immediate next steps (of myopic strategy). Mathematical recursion
is derived to prove that the contribution of utility improvement of each added
horizon step diminishes fast as that step moves further into the future.

scene in an end-to-end fashion is still far from being achieved. Instead, here
we follow a two stages approach, where interpretable information is included in
the loop and each actor is modelled independently. We leverage a per-object
novel view synthesis paradigm; i.e. generating a synthetic representation of an
object undergoing a geometrical roto-translation in the 3D space. Our model can
be easily conditioned with constraints (e.g. input trajectories) provided by
state-of-the-art tracking methods or by the user itself. This allows us to
generate a set of diverse realistic futures starting from the same input in a
multi-modal fashion. We visually and quantitatively show the superiority of
this approach over traditional end-to-end scene-generation methods on CityFlow,
a challenging real world dataset.

which are known to $\epsilon$-approximate any random utility model. Despite its
long history and broad use, rigorous results are only available for learning a
uniform mixture of two MNLs. Continuing this line of research, we study the
problem of learning an arbitrary mixture of two MNLs. We show that the
identifiability of the mixture models may only fail on an algebraic variety of
Lebesgue measure $0$, implying that all existing algorithms apply in the almost
sure sense. This is done by reducing the problem of learning a mixture of two
MNLs to the problem of solving a system of univariate quartic equations. As a
byproduct, we derive an algorithm to learn any mixture of two MNLs in linear
time provided that a mixture of two MNLs over some finite universe is
identifiable. Several numerical experiments and conjectures are also presented.

their capability of learning to extract robust and descriptive features from
high dimensional data, like images. Hence, such an ability renders their
exploitation as feature extractors particularly frequent in an abundant of
modern reasoning systems. Their application scope mainly includes complex
cascade tasks, like multi-modal recognition and deep Reinforcement Learning
(RL). However, NNs induce implicit biases that are difficult to avoid or to
deal with and are not met in traditional image descriptors. Moreover, the lack
of knowledge for describing the intra-layer properties -- and thus their
general behavior -- restricts the further applicability of the extracted
features. With the paper at hand, a novel way of visualizing and understanding
the vector space before the NNs' output layer is presented, aiming to enlighten
the deep feature vectors' properties under classification tasks. Main attention
is paid to the nature of overfitting in the feature space and its adverse
effect on further exploitation. We present the findings that can be derived
from our model's formulation, and we evaluate them on realistic recognition
scenarios, proving its prominence by improving the obtained results.

    <p>Dubious journal publisher MDPI provides special-issue editors with some number of no-publication-charge slots, but requires that priority for these slots be given to first-world scholars, because they are the ones with “more abundant scientific research resources” (read: funds to pay publication charges). This didn’t sit well with three environmental health failure researchers, who <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/06/16/failure-fails-as-publisher-privileges-the-privileged/">resigned their guest editorship over it</a> (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104363585936972806"></a>, <a href="https://wash.leeds.ac.uk/what-the-f-how-we-failed-to-publish-a-journal-special-issue-on-failures/">see also</a>).</p>

Ritchie’s doctoral committee signed off in 1968, but the Harvard Library wanted a bound copy and he was unwilling to pay the binding costs so he never officially received his Ph.D. According to the post, the thesis defines a simple model of computation characterizing primitive recursion, within which one can prove that the complexity and growth rates of primitive recursive functions are equal.</p>

In a STOC 1976 paper, Schaefer proved that it is PSPACE-complete to determine the winner of the so-called Maker-Breaker game on a given set system, even when every set has size at most 11. Since then, there has been no improvement on this result. We prove that the game remains PSPACE-complete even when every set has size 6.</div>

<p>In order to assist organizers of other virtual conferences, the general chairs of STOC 2020 (myself, Konstantin Makarychev, Yury Makarychev and Madhur Tulsiani, with input from PC chair Julia Chuzhoy) wrote a detailed document describing the design and execution of the conference.

<p>2020 sucks.</p>



<p>Yesterday I learned that <a href="https://www.cifar.ca/cifarnews/2020/06/18/a-quantum-festschrift-for-david-poulin">David Poulin</a>, a creative and widely-beloved quantum computing and information theorist, has died at age 43, of an aggressive brain cancer.  After studying under many of the field’s legends—Gilles Brassard, Wojciech Zurek, Ray Laflamme, Gerard Milburn, John Preskill—David became a professor at the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec.  There he played a leading role in CIFAR (the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research), eventually co-directing its quantum information science program with Aephraim Steinberg.  Just this fall (!), David moved to Microsoft Research to start a new phase of his career.  He’s survived by a large family.</p>



<p>While I can’t claim any deep knowledge of David’s work—he and I pursued very different problems—it seems appropriate to mention some of his best-known contributions.  With David Kribs, Ray Laflamme, and Maia Lesosky, he <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0504189">introduced</a> the formalism of operator quantum error correction, and made many other contributions to the theory of quantum error-correction and fault-tolerance (including the estimation of thresholds).  He and coauthors <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1147">showed</a> in a <em>Nature</em> paper how to do quantum state tomography on 1D matrix product states efficiently.  With Pavithran Iyer, he <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3235">proved</a> that optimal decoding of stabilizer codes is #P-hard.</p>



<p>And if none of that makes a sufficient impression on <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers: well, back in 2013, when D-Wave was claiming to have achieved huge quantum speedups, David Poulin was one of the few experts willing to take a clear skeptical stance in public (including right in my comment section—see <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1400#comment-79596">here</a> for example).</p>



<p>I vividly remember being officemates with David back in 2003, at the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo—before Perimeter had its sleek black building, when it still operated out of a converted tavern.  (My and David’s office was in the basement, reached via a narrow staircase.)  David liked to tease me: for example, if I found him in conversation with someone else and asked what it was about, he’d say, “oh, nothing to do with computational efficiency, no reason for you to care.”  (And yet, much of David’s work ultimately <em>would</em> have to do with computational efficiency.)</p>



<p>David was taken way too soon and will be missed by everyone who knew him.  Feel free to share David stories in the comments.</p></div>

Joshua Greene and Andrew Lobb <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09193.pdf">proved</a> last month that every <em>smooth</em> Jordan curve in the plane and real <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br+%5Cleq+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r \leq 1}" class="latex" title="{r \leq 1}" />, there are four points on the curve that form a rectangle with sides of ratio <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" />.</p>
<p>
Today we explain how this result relates to Otto Toeplitz’s famous “square peg conjecture,” which is the case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r = 1}" class="latex" title="{r = 1}" /> when the curve need not be smooth.</p>
<p>
We noticed this via an <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-geometric-perspective-cracks-old-problem-about-rectangles-20200625/">article</a> last Thursday by Kevin Hartnett for <em>Quanta</em>. Hartnett describes this research advance as a product of the pandemic inducing them to take time for deeper reflection on fundamental problems. We wonder how much is bubbling on hard problems in our own field—this is one reason for our last post’s <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/06/21/some-real-and-some-virtual-news">interest</a> in (good kinds of) “gossip.”  He also gives great diagrams for the geometrical intuition.</p>
<p>
We will portray this advance instead along lines of things we’ve said recently about how to attack hard problems by seeking and solving simpler ones or special cases as stepping stones. Dick wrote a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/10/21/the-inscribed-square-problem/">post</a> two years ago on the original Toeplitz problem, which this work still leaves open. That post focused on ways general Jordan curves can be nasty. This one needs an extra niceness condition but proves a stronger result for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" />. How much can progress on “nice” inform problems with “nasty”? That kind of question comes up in complexity theory all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Pegging Rectangles </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
A <em>Jordan curve</em> is the image of a continuous 1-1 map <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f}" class="latex" title="{f}" /> from the circle to the plane. The condition of being 1-1 prevents the image from intersecting itself, so it is a single closed loop. By the Jordan curve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_curve_theorem">theorem</a>, the loop always partitions the rest of the plane into two connected regions, exactly one of which is bounded. Amazingly, a Jordan curve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osgood_curve">can</a> have positive Lebesgue measure, yet cannot fill all of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathbb{R}^2}" class="latex" title="{\mathbb{R}^2}" />. Such curves can, however, approach the kind of space-filling curves defined by Giuseppe Peano, and thus have any Lebesgue density less than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />, as was noted also by William Osgood in his 1903 <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1986455.pdf">paper</a>.</p>
<p>
The Toeplitz conjecture is that every Jordan curve has four points that form a square. As noted in Dick’s post, the positive-area case is actually an easy yes-case. Nasty cases are where the curve is nowhere-differentiable with zero area. Thus far, the problem has been answered <em>yes</em> only in the presence of some uniformity condition that limits the local nastiness of the curve. The simplest one is for the curve to be <em>smooth</em> in that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f}" class="latex" title="{f}" /> has a continuous first derivative. Here is a smooth curve that is not convex, so that the square need not be “inside” the curve:</p>
<p></p><p></p>

<p>
This diagram is from Benjamin Matchske’s wonderful recent <a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/201404/rnoti-p346.pdf">survey</a> of the peg problem in the <em>AMS Notices</em>. Four months ago we’d have said it looks like a thin heart or fat boomerang. <i>Now</i> it looks to us like a face mask.</p>
<p>
As the survey notes, it is easy to show that every Jordan curve has <em>some</em> rectangle. The rectangle problem is to show that rectangles of <i>every</i> aspect ratio <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" /> can be pegged to the curve. There are two main reasons the square and rectangle problems are hard and harder:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Although any Jordan curve can be written as a limit of nice ones, the squares in the nice ones can degenerate to a single point in the limit. <p></p>
</li><li>
Even for nice curves, a parity property that holds for squares can fail for rectangles.
</li></ol>
<p>
The property in the second point enables arguments of the kind: <em>for generic curves the number of squares is odd, therefore it is nonzero</em>. This then carries over to sufficiently nice curves in the generic closure. The failure of this property for rectangles is a main reason the results by Greene and Lobb are new.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Paper </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The new paper is written tersely at a high level, and we must confess not being able to catch all details in compressed time. But we can highlight some aspects of the argument. First, as we have said, it exemplifies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Solve a Simpler Problem</em>.
</li></ul>
<p>
This is however coupled with a second aspect:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Bring Up the Reserves</em>.
</li></ul>
<p>
It may be that the rectangle conjecture is not only true but “equally true” in the sense that the fundamental reason applies equally well to the case of rectangles. The parity argument that works for cases involving squares may be a crutch that misses the deepest explanations. Promoting arguments that avoid this crutch may marshal resources needed to make a breakthrough on the main problem for completely general Jordan curves.</p>
<p>
This runs somewhat counter to what we have said about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" /> versus <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P}}" /> proof attempts recently. The reason for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" /> believed by most is that problems like SAT require <em>exponential</em> time, not just super-polynomial time. Yet no one knows even a <em>super-linear</em> lower bound, apart from barely-superlinear bounds that exploit grainy aspects of the multitape Turing machine model and apply only to it. Nor is any super-linear lower bound known on Boolean circuit size. Maybe it is a viable strategy also to “bring up reserves” by finding restricted cases where (conditional) exponential lower bounds can be proven, as well as to explore contingencies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_time_hypothesis">SETH</a>, as we covered <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/06/01/puzzling-evidence/">here</a>. But both of use have always felt that the super-linear frontier holds the buried keys to further progress.</p>
<p>
The Greene-Lobb proof has two aspects that may also resonate in complexity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Blow Up the Objects</em>.
</li></ul>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-geometric-perspective-cracks-old-problem-about-rectangles-20200625/">article</a> in <em>Quanta</em> has great diagrams illustrating how the set of pairs of points on the curve corresponds to a Möbius strip in a related space. Cole Hugelmeyer, a graduate student at Princeton, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07336.pdf">proved</a> last year how to get rectangles covering at least one-third of possible values <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br+%5Cin+%280%2C1%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r \in (0,1]}" class="latex" title="{r \in (0,1]}" /> by embedding the Möbius strips in a four-dimensional space. Intersections between a strip and a rotated copy yield rectangles on the original Jordan curve. </p>
<p>
That led Greene and Lobb to consider larger objects with properties like pairs of Möbius strips in the larger space. The Klein bottle is the natural next thing to consider and led to a feature of their proof that made the desired conclusion pop out:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Identify and Rule Out Obstructions</em>.
</li></ul>
<p>
The clever point pivots on the fact that a Klein bottle cannot be smoothly embedded into the complex plane <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathbb{C}^2}" class="latex" title="{\mathbb{C}^2}" /> as a Lagrangian submanifold. The proof shows that for any prescribed aspect ratio <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" /> one can construct a mapping that almost succeeds in embedding such a Klein bottle. The fact that it must fail means that the image must yield a point of intersection witnessing the failure. The presence of this point then yields the construction of four other points on the Jordan curve that form the vertices of the needed rectangle.</p>
<p>
We have briefly <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/06/06/princeton-is-invariant/">mentioned</a> how the concept of <em>obstructions</em> is integral to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_complexity_theory">Geometric</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1944345.1944346">Complexity</a> <a href="http://gct.cs.uchicago.edu/">Theory</a> attack on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" />. Closer to home, however, is how László Babai's graph isomorphism algorithm and proof works by identifying a subclass of graphs called Johnson graphs as obstructions to a simpler algorithm, as we highlighted <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2017/01/06/snow-and-theory/">here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Can you find more lessons from the new advance on the Toeplitz problem?  Dick and I have considered ideas of blowing up from languages to pairs of languages (and making <i>reductions</i> between problems the fundamental units of analysis) but this has not gone beyond dreamwork.</p>

<div class="content">
<br />
I was re-watching the  Greatest-of-all-time Jeopardy championship and the following happen (I paraphrase)<br />
<br />
----------------------<br />
Alex Trebek: The category is Chemistry and we have a special guest reading the clues.<br />
<br />
Darling: I wonder who that will be.<br />
<br />
Bill: Hmm. I assume some famous chemist.<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
So who was it? Bryan Cranston, the actor who PLAYED chemist Walter White on <i>Breaking Bad.</i><br />
<br />
Why couldn't they get a famous living chemist to read the clues?<br />
<br />
My guess: there are no famous living chemists.<br />
<br />
The number of famous living scientists is fairly short and they are often known for things that are not quite their science. Some are famous because the popularize science (deGrasse Tyson, Dawkins) or because of something unusual about their life (Hawkings when he was alive) or for something else entirely that they did (Ted Kaczynski).  Are any famous for the actual work that they do in the science?<br />
<br />
Andrew Wiles was famous for a brief time, and even made People Magazine's <i>25 most intriguing people of the year</i> list in the early 1990's (after he solved Fermat's Last Theorem). So he was famous but it was short lived.<br />
<br />
Terry Tao was on the Colbert Report (see <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/6wtwlg/the-colbert-report-terence-tao">here</a>) after he won the Fields Medal, the MacAuthor Genius award, and the Breakthrough prize. And even that fame was short lived.<br />
<br />
I looked at the web page of Nobel Prize winners, <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-prizes">here</a>.<br />
<br />
The only Chemistry Nobel's I recognized were Marie Curie,  Irene Joilet-Curie (Marie's Daughter), and Erst Rutherford.<br />
<br />
The only Physics Nobel's I recognized were<br />
<br />
Richard Feynman,<br />
<br />
 Eugene Wigner (for writing about <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html">The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences</a>),<br />
<br />
Richard Hofstadter (since he was the father of Douglas H and an uncle of Leonard H)<br />
<br />
 Andrew Geim (since he won  both an Ig-Noble prize and a Nobel prize, see  <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2010/10/noble-and-ig-noble-prizes.html">here</a>)<br />
<br />
Wolfgang Pauli (I've heard the term `Pauli Principle" though I did not know what it was until I looked it up while preparing this blog. I prob still don't really know what it means.)<br />
<br />
Enrico Fermi<br />
<br />
Erwin Schrodinger<br />
<br />
Paul Dirac<br />
<br />
Robert Millikan<br />
<br />
Albert Einstein<br />
<br />
Max Karl Ernest Ludwig Planck (I thought his last name was `Institute')<br />
<br />
Johannes Diderik van der Waals<br />
<br />
Pierre Curie<br />
<br />
Marie Curie<br />
<br />
<br />
So, some questions:<br />
<br />
a) Am I wrong? Are there famous living chemists I never heard of? Are there any famous living scientists who are famous for their work in science?<br />
<br />
b) If I am right then was there ever a time when there were famous scientists?<br />
<br />
c) If there was such a time, what changed?<br />
<br />
(I ask all of this non-rhetorically and with no agenda to push.)<br />
<br />

<div class="content">
<p>I’m giving a keynote address at the <a href="https://www.ifac2020.org/">virtual IFAC congress this July</a>, and I submitted an abstract that forces me to reflect on the current state of research at the intersection of machine learning and control. 2020 is particularly appropriate for reflection: For personal reasons, I’ve been working in this space for about half a decade now and <a href="https://www.argmin.net/2018/06/25/outsider-rl/">wrote a blog series on the topic two years ago</a> and it seemed like ideal timing. For the broader community, 2020 happens to be the year we were promised fleets of self-driving cars. Of course, for a myriad of reasons, we’re nowhere close to achieving this goal. Full self-driving has been a key motivator of work in learning-enabled autonomous systems, and it’s important to note this example as a marker of how difficult problems this space really are.</p>

<p>The research community has come to terms with this difficulty, and has committed itself to address the many pressing challenges. Over the last year I attended several great meetings on this topic, including an <a href="https://ajwagen.github.io/adsi_learning_and_control/">NSF funded workshop at UW</a>, a plenary session at <a href="https://ita.ucsd.edu/ws/">ITA</a>, a workshop on intersections of <a href="https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/intersections-between-control-learning-and-optimization/?tab=overview">learning, control, and optimization at IPAM</a>, and the <a href="https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/l4dc/home">second annual conference on Learning for Dynamics and Control</a>. There is clearly a ton of enthusiasm from researchers in a many different disciplines, and we’re seeing fascinating results mixing techniques from machine learning, computer science, and control. Obviously, I’m going to be leaving out many incredible papers, but, focusing on the theoretical end of the spectrum, perhaps I could highlight <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11899">new work on policy optimization</a> that demonstrates how simple optimization techniques can efficiently solve classic, nonconvex control-design problems or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08721">work connecting regret minimization and adaptive control</a> that provides nonasymptotic bounds.</p>

<p>This work has been very useful for establishing language to bridge communication between the diverse research camps interested in the space of learning, dynamics and automation. But, as I’ll discuss shortly, I’d argue that it hasn’t provided many promising approaches to improving large-scale autonomy. That’s ok! These problems are incredibly difficult and aren’t going to be solved by wishing for them to be solved. But I also think it might be worth taking a moment to reflect on which problems we are working on. It’s always a bit too easy for theorists to focus  on improving technical results and lose sight of why someone proved those results in the first place.</p>

<p>As an illustrative example, my research group spent a lot of time studying the <a href="http://www.argmin.net/2018/02/08/lqr/">Linear Quadratic Regulator</a> (LQR). The point of this work was initially to establish baselines: LQR has a closed form solution when the model is known, so we wanted to understand how different algorithms might perform when the underlying model was unknown. It turns out that if you are willing to collect enough data, the best thing you can do for LQR is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07826">estimate the dynamical model, and then exploit this model as if it were true</a>. This so-called “certainty equivalent control” is what practitioners have been doing since the mid-60s to fly satellites and solve other optimal control problems. Proving this result required a bunch of new mathematical insights that established connections between high dimensional statistics and automatic control theory. But it did not bring us closer to solving new challenges in robotics or autonomous systems. Our work here merely showed that what the controls community had been doing for 50 years was already about as well as we could do for this important baseline problem.</p>

<p>So what are the ways forward? Are there things that theory-minded folks can work on short term that might help us understand paths towards improving learning systems in complex feedback loops? Let me suggest a few challenges that I see as both very pressing, but also ones where we might be able to make near-term progress.</p>

<h2 id="machine-learning-is-still-not-reliable-technology">Machine Learning is still not reliable technology</h2>

<p>At the aforementioned <a href="https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/intersections-between-control-learning-and-optimization/?tab=overview">IPAM meeting</a>, Richard Murray gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wi8Y---ce28">fantastic survey of the sorts of standards of reliability imposed in aerospace engineering</a>. Go watch it! I don’t want to spoil it for you, but his discussion of Ram Air Turbines is gripping. Richard covers what is needed to get to the sorts of reliability we’d like in autonomous systems. Unfortunately, having <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08237">88.5% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet</a>—while a stunning achievement—doesn’t tell us how to get to systems with failure rates on the order of 1 in a billion. As Boeing has tragically shown, cutting corners on autonomous system safety standards has horrible, tragic consequences.</p>

<p>How can we make machine learning more robust? How can we approach the failure rates needed for safe, reliable autonomy? And how can we establish testing protocols to assure we have such low failure rates?</p>

<h2 id="prediction-systems-in-feedback-loops">Prediction systems in feedback loops</h2>

<p>One particular aspect that I think is worth considering is how supervised learning systems can function as “sensors” in feedback loops. Even if you know everything about a dynamical system, when you observe the state via an estimator generated by a learned component, it’s not clear how to best take action on this observation. Most classic control and planning assumes that your errors in state-estimation are Gaussian or nicely uniformly bounded. Of course, the errors from machine learning systems are neither of these (I recommend checking out the <a href="https://youtu.be/A0cb7wZVFf4">crazy videos</a> of the <a href="https://twitter.com/greentheonly/status/1130956365063761920">confusion</a> that comes out of Tesla Autopilot’s vision systems). How to properly characterize the errors of machine learning systems for control applications seems like a useful, understudied problem. Using off-the-shelf machine learing analysis, it’s unavoidable to have to densely sample all of the possible scenarios in advance in order to guarantee the sort of uniform error bounds desired by control algorithms. This isn’t practical, and, indeed, it’s clear that this sort of sensor characterization is not needed to make reasonable demos work. Though it’s a bit mundane, I think a huge contribution lies in understanding how much data we need to quantify the uncertainty in learned perception components. It’s still not clear to me if this is a machine learning question or a closed-loop design question, and I suspect both views of the problem will be needed to make progress.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-we-all-sleeping-on-model-predictive-control">Why are we all sleeping on model predictive control?</h2>

<p>I still remain baffled by how <a href="http://www.argmin.net/2018/05/02/adp/">model predictive control</a> (MPC) is consistently under appreciated. We’ll commonly see the same tasks in the same meeting, one task done on a robot using some sort of deep reinforcement learning and the other done using model predictive control, and the disparity in performance is stark. It’s like the difference between watching an Olympic level sprinter and me jogging in my neighborhood with a set of orthotics.</p>

<p>Here’s an example from the IPAM workshop. Martin Riedmiller presented work at DeepMind to catch a ball in a cup:</p>



<p>This system uses two cameras, has a rather large “cup,” (it’s a wastepaper basket) and yet still takes 3 days to train on the robot. Francesco Borrelli presented a different approach. Using only a single camera and basic, simple Newtonian physics, and MPC they were able to achieve this performance on the standard-sized “ball-in-a-cup” toy:</p>



<p>If you only saw these two videos, I can’t fathom why would you invest all of your assets into deep RL. I understand there are still a lot of diehards out there, and I know this will offend them. But I want to make a constructive point: so many theorists are spending a lot of time studying RL algorithms, but few in the ML community are analyzing MPC and why it’s so successful. We should rebalance our allocation of mental resources!</p>

<p>Now, while the basic idea of MPC is very simple, the theory gets very hairy very quickly. It definitely takes some time and effort to learn about how to prove convergence of MPC protocols. I’d urge the MPC crowd to connect more with the learning theory crowd to see if a common ground can be found to better understand how MPC works and how we might push its performance even farther.</p>

<h2 id="perhaps-we-should-stop-taking-cues-from-alphago">Perhaps we should stop taking cues from AlphaGo?</h2>

<p>One of the grand goals in RL is to use function approximation algorithms to estimate value functions. The conventional wisdom asserts that the world is a giant Markov Decision Process and once you have its value function, you can just greedily maximize it and you’ll win at life. Now, this sort of approach clearly doesn’t work for robots, and I’m perplexed by why people still think it will work at all. Part of the motivation is that this approach was used to solve Go. But at some point I think we all have to come to terms with the fact that games are not the real world.</p>

<p>Now, I’d actually argue that RL <em>does</em> work in the real world, but it’s in systems that most people don’t actively think of as RL systems. Greedy value function estimation and exploitation is <em>literally</em> how all internet revenue is made. Systems simply use past data to estimate value functions and then choose the action that maximizes the value at the next step. Though seldom described as such, these are instances of the “greedy contextual bandit” algorithm, and this algorithm makes tech companies tons of money. But many researchers have also pointed out that this algorithm leads to misinformation, polarization, and radicalization.</p>

<p>Everyone tries to motivate RL by the success of AlphaGo, but they should be using the success of Facebook and Google instead. And if they did this, I think it would be a lot more clear why RL is terrifying and dangerous, and one whose limitations we desperately need to understand so that we can build safer tools.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-from-the-70s-about-optimal-control">Lessons from the 70s about optimal control</h2>

<p>I have one set of ideas along these lines that, while I think is important, I still am having a hard time articulating. Indeed, I might just take a few blog posts to work through my thoughts on this, but let me close this blog with a teaser of discussions to come. As I mentioned above, optimal control was a guiding paradigm for a variety of control applications in the 60s and 70s. During this time, it seemed like there might even be hidden benefits to a full-on optimization paradigm: though you’d optimize a single, simple objective, you would often get additional robustness guarantees for free. However, it turned out that this was very misleading and that <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1101812">there were no guarantees of robustness even for simple optimal control problems</a>. This shouldn’t be too surprising, as if you devote a lot of resources towards one objective, you are likely neglecting some other objective. But showing how and why these fragilities arise is quite delicate. It’s not always obvious how you <em>should</em> be devoting your resources.</p>

<p>Trying to determine how to allocate engineering resources to balance safety and performance is the heart of “robust control.” One thing I’m fascinated by moving forward is if any of the early developments in robust control might transfer over for a new kind of “robust ML.” Unfortunately for all of us, robust control is a rather encrypted literature. There is a lot of mathematics, but often not clear statements about <em>why</em> we study particular problems or what are the fundamental limits of feedback. While diligent young learning theorists have been scouring classic control theory text books for insights, these books don’t always articulate what we can and cannot do and what are the problems that control theory might help solve. We still have a lot of work to do in communicating what we know and what problems remain challenging. I think it would be useful for control theorists to think of how to best communicate the fundamental concepts of robust control. I hope to take up this challenge in the next few months on this blog.</p>

<p><em>I’d like to thank Sarah Dean, Horia Mania, Nik Matni, and Ludwig Schmidt for their helpful feedback on this post. I’d also like to thank John Doyle for several inspiring conversations about robustness in optimal control and on the encrypted state of the control theory literature.</em></p></div>

<p>Here’s a cute exercise for the next time you’re teaching radix sorting in an algorithms class:</p>

<p>Suppose you’re given as input a set of real numbers , and an integer parameter . Describe an algorithm for sorting the  numbers  in time . You can assume that standard arithmetic operations on real numbers (including comparisons and rounding down to an integer) take constant time per operation.</p>

<p>Models of computation that mix constant-time real arithmetic and rounding operations can be problematic, as by building up and then rounding numbers with unlimited precision you can access a level of computational power beyond what actual computers can do, but I don’t think that’s a concern here. If someone wants to use bit-packing tricks to implement a crazy but fast sorting algorithm in this model, they’re beyond the level of this exercise.</p>

<p>The same method (which I’m not going to describe, to preserve its value as an exercise) more generally allows you to take as input pairs  and sort the numbers  in time  where . But it relies heavily on the fact that you’re adding integers to the ’s. For a problem that can’t be handled in this way, consider instead sorting the numbers  where we multiply instead of adding. Or, if you prefer to view this as a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_%2B_Y_sorting"> sorting</a> problem, take logs in your favorite base and sort the numbers . It’s not at all obvious to me whether this can be done in the same  time bound.</p>

<p>The motivation for looking at all this is <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/47120/95">a question about how to implement the greedy set cover quickly</a>. You can find the unweighted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_cover_problem#Greedy_algorithm">greedy set cover</a> in linear time (linear in the sum of the sizes of the input sets; this is an exercise in CLRS), and you can approximate the weighted greedy set cover very accurately in linear time using similar ideas. If you could sort  quickly you could use the sorted order to compute the weighted greedy set cover exactly in the same time as the sorting algorithm. Which is totally useless because the greedy cover is already an approximation, so a fast and accurate approximation to the greedy cover is good enough. But I think the question of sorting  is interesting despite its uselessness in this application.</p>

The STOC workshop on Algorithms with Predictions was on Friday, and I thought it went really well!  I can't speak for my talk, but the other 3 talks (Tim Roughgarden, Edith Cohen, Ravi Kumar) were fantastic and inspiring, and I really recommend them for anyone with an interest in "Beyond Worst-Case Analysis".   <br /><br />The talks are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byKYJwN6XKw&amp;feature=youtu.be">all on Youtube</a>.  And the <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~vakilian/stoc-workshop.html">workshop page</a> is full of useful links and information.</div>

<p>Sorry for the long blog silence. In this post I wish to give a few links each of which probably deserves a full post. I will start with</p>
<h2>Rani Sharim’s two-player variants of John Conway’s game-of-life</h2>
<p><a href="https://ranisharim.github.io/game_of_life_2_players/">Here is a web-page</a> by a student in my “Game Theory” course where you can play several two-players variants of John Conway’s game-of-life.  (A couple of variants were considered before. See, e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0207679">this  paper</a>.)</p>
<p>I really enjoyed playing Rani’s games and it can certainly cheer you up in difficult times. Questions about the game, remarks, and suggestions for improvements and for new features, are most welcome.</p>
<h2>How to catch lies with statistics, a 2006  presentation by Maya Bar-Hillel</h2>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/mayesther.png"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/mayesther.png?w=640" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19929" /></a></p>
<p>Maya Bar-Hillel (left) and Ester Samuel-Cahn</p>
<p>Here is an interesting 2006 <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/ester.ppt">power point presentation entitled <strong><em>How to detect lies with statistics</em></strong> by Maya Bar-Hillel.</a>  This was a talk given by Maya at the <a href="http://www.esterconference.huji.ac.il/">conference</a> honoring Prof. Ester Samuel- Cahn , Jerusalem, December 18-20, 2006, and it described a planned research project of Maya Bar-Hillel with Yossi Rinott, David Budescu and myself. At the end we did not pursue it, mainly because each of us was involved in various other projects (but also because we were skeptical about some aspects of it.)  Ester Samuel-Cahn (1933-2015) was a famous Israeli statistician. (Here is a <a href="http://www.sci-princess.info/archives/291">post by Yosi Levy in Hebrew</a> about the conference and about Ester.)</p>
<p>The lecture starts with “Last year, <em>Statistical Science</em> celebrated 50 years for `How to Lie with Statistics’ the book [by Durell Huff] whose title inspired this talk.”</p>
<p>And here are a few other quotes from Maya’s presentation</p>
<p>“We are not sure a general toolkit for detecting lies with statistics can be developed. Perhaps that explains why none yet exists.  We have shown just a collection of anecdotes. But they can be classified and categorized. Some do seem generalizeable, at least to some extent.”</p>
<p>and the conclusion</p>
<blockquote><p>A famous quip by Fred Mosteller: “It is easy to lie with statistics, but easier to lie without them.”</p>
<p>Likewise, we should say:  “It is possible to detect (some) lies with statistics, but easier to detect them with other means”.</p></blockquote>
<h2>New bounds for Ryser’s conjecture and related problems</h2>
<p>Peter Keevash, Alexey Pokrovskiy, Benny Sudakov, and Liana Yepremyan’s paper  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00526">New bounds for Ryser’s conjecture and related problems,</a> describes remarkable progress very old questions regarding transversals in Latin square.</p>
<h2>Topological Tverberg news</h2>
<p>I came across a very interesting paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05251">The topological Tverberg problem beyond <span class="search-hit mathjax">prime</span> powers</a> by Florian Frick and Pablo Soberón with new bounds and a new method for topological Tverberg theorem in the non prime-power case.</p>
<h2>Jeager’s conjecture refuted</h2>
<p>A year ago I came across <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2114324995342352&amp;set=a.507523926022475&amp;type=3&amp;theater">this cool facebook post</a> by Rupei Xu</p>
<blockquote><p>OMG! Just learned that Jaeger’s conjecture is false for every t&gt;=3. An interesting consequence of it is that a specific version of Goddyn’s conjecture on thin spanning trees is false, which shows some negative evidence that the thin spanning tree approaches may fail to lead to a constant factor approximation algorithm for ATSP!</p></blockquote>
<h2>A cool rainbow post <a href="http://matroidunion.org/?p=2541">Short rainbow cycles in graphs and matroids</a> by Tony Huynh</h2>
<h2>More on the game of life</h2>
<p>Let me mention two problems I posted 6-7 years ago about Conway’s game of life. <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/132402/conways-game-of-life-for-random-initial-position" class="question-hyperlink">Conway’s game of life for random initial position</a> and <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/17914/does-a-noisy-version-of-conways-game-of-life-support-universal-computation" class="question-hyperlink">Does a noisy version of Conway’s game of life support universal computation?</a></p>

This post both relates to some of the stuff I'll be presenting at Friday's STOC workshop on Algorithms with Predictions, but is also for future students in my classes, who sometimes wonder why I have them write code on theory material.  (Somehow this might be a theme for a lecture in my grad class next semester, so maybe these are a first attempt at notes for the lecture.  Comments  and  suggestions welcome.)<br /><br />Some of the work I'm doing is looking at how queueing systems perform with various sorts of predictions on the times the jobs take.  This particular work I'm doing on my own.  (While most of my research has been and is with collaborators, and it's one of the things I enjoy about computer science -- we're a very collaborative field!, which seems to surprise many people -- I still sometimes like to do research projects on my own.  I've looked at queueing systems since my PhD thesis, and it's a bit outside the research interest of most of my collaborator pool, and it's "fun" sometimes to do my own thing.  The reason why "fun" is in quotes is described below.)  <br /><br />Often in my work in queueing I'm looking at mean-field limits (meant to model infinite systems of queues, which provides a good approximation for large finite systems under reasonable assumptions), where I can derive families of differential equations describing the system behavior.  I can also simulate the large finite system directly, and make sure the results match.  I generally do this for all of these types of papers.<br /><br />Now the numbers I get from simulating the system directly and from simulating the differential equations should match (say within 1% or so).  If they don't, something is wrong.  In an effort to avoid wrongness, I won't consider the paper ready for outside consumption until I get a match.  Unfortunately, there are three ways things can go wrong.<br /><br />1.  My simulation code for the queueing system might have bugs.<br />2.  My code to evaluate the differential equations might have bugs.<br />3.  My equations themselves might have bugs.<br /><br />And I find there are two main categories of bugs.  Sometimes the bugs are simple/standard coding mistakes -- I'm off by 1 on an index, or I cut and paste and forget to change an i++ to a j++ in one my double loops, or I type x instead of a y.  Usually it's pretty easy to find these things, although I've had times where a hidden typo took hours to find.  But sometimes the bug is a thinking mistake -- I've forgotten a subcase and so my equations aren't complete (and so my code evaluating the equations won't give the right answer), or I've not handled a subcase correctly in my simulation.  That type usually takes longer. <br /><br />Usually, the first time through, most all of these types of bugs happen -- my math is off, I've typed some stuff wrong, it can all happen.  And then, like coders everywhere, I go through and fix it.  And it's painful.  Sometimes everything goes right, a quick check or two and everything works.  For more complicated stuff, it's more time figuring out what went wrong than setting up the code to begin with.  And being the personality type to not let things sit, that can mean late nights figuring out what went wrong.<br /><br />For my talk this week, there was one last problem I wanted to include, which meant finally taking the model and writing the equations and code.  I didn't even need it for the talk, but it's also the last bit before I put a paper draft on arxiv, so taking advantage of a deadline, I figured now was the time.  Which means the last 2 days, I've spent many hours (and a late night) trying to remove the disagreements.<br /><br />On the plus side, when everything finally works, it's a wonderful feeling.  And it always makes me feel better when I have worked to verify my math this way;  this time, what kept me up well past midnight and took several hours to track down was actually a boundary case I had left out of the equations.  (I had looked at the equations over and over again without noticing I had left out the subcase;  I had to step through numbers from the differential equations one time step at a time to track down what was missing, and then the numbers told me what I had done wrong.)<br /><br />On the down side, it's work, and debugging is never particularly fun.<br /><br />For students out there, maybe I'm just explaining that I understand the pain that I am putting you through.  You may wonder why I have you do simulations that take a few hours if you do them well, but days if you don't think through the best approach.  But using programming and theory together can be powerful;  it's helped me countless times in my research.<br /><br />(Related: on theory and experiments that <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/9/191184-theory-without-experiments/fulltext">I've written on before</a>, along with <a
