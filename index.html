Jemma Lorenat is an assistant professor at <a href="https://www.pitzer.edu">Pitzer College</a> in Los Angeles. She teaches and does research on the history of mathematics.<br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/11/12/the-art-of-math/jemma/" rel="attachment wp-att-17751"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/jemma.png?w=600" alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-17751" /></a></p>
<p>
Today I thought we’d look at some of her work. </p>
<p>
History of math is one topic that we have focused on many times before. More on that in a moment. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Her Art </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
But before we do that I wish to present Lorenat’s art work. My late father, Jack Lipton, was an artist and so perhaps I have a genetic interest in art. Lorenat is an artist besides being a mathematician. You can see some of her drawings of famous mathematicians <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/portrait-gallery">here</a>. Her elegant style I find appealing. See if you like it as much as I do. My dad taught me: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A clean drawing is more difficult to execute than a busy one. It is hard to hide flaws when your art is clean. </em>
</p></blockquote>

</p><p></p><h2> Her Research </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Lorenat’s research is on the history of mathematics. My first choice is to create math, but I am intrigued by the history of who did what, when, and why. We must understand history—at least in broad strokes—if we are to continue to make progress. History helps us understand how progress was made and how it was not. History teaches us much about our field, about mathematics. </p>
<p>
<a href="http://archives.math.utk.edu/topics/history.html">Several</a> online <a href="https://www.math.tamu.edu/~dallen/masters/hist_frame.htm">sources</a> show the field’s breadth and scope. Among issues and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematics_history_topics">topics</a>, we note:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Who is a result named for? <p></p>
</li><li>
Who gets the credit for a result? <p></p>
</li><li>
What is the strongest result known? <p></p>
</li><li>
Is this result correct?
</li></ul>
<p>
It is fun to see the process in action. One example I have been involved in for a long time is the study of vector addition systems and reachability problems. There continues to be exciting news, for instance, a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07115.pdf">paper</a> last year showing that a central reachability problem is vastly harder than had been conjectured. I will discuss, however, an issue from two centuries ago that Lorenat has illuminated.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Duality Controversy </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Lorenat has a <a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/78167-culturalcontextconference2015.pdf">talk</a> on the geometric theory of duality. It was a prime example of a controversy in the discover of a basic math idea. Here duality means: Given a statement from projective geometry we can flip points and lines and still leave its correctness invariant. This is the duality: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++points+%5Ciff+lines.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  points \iff lines. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  points \iff lines. " /></p>
<p></p><p></p>

</td>

<tr>

</tbody></table>
<p>
In complexity theory we have our own duality. Instead of flipping points and lines we can exchange boolean operations 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++AND+%5Ciff+OR%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  AND \iff OR, " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  AND \iff OR, " /></p>
<p>and also exchange 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++0+%5Ciff+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  0 \iff 1. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  0 \iff 1. " /></p>
<p>	 Thus 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28x+%5Cwedge+y%29+%5Cvee+%28x+%5Cwedge+z%29+%5Ciff+%28x+%5Cvee+y%29+%5Cwedge+%28x+%5Cvee+z%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  (x \wedge y) \vee (x \wedge z) \iff (x \vee y) \wedge (x \vee z). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  (x \wedge y) \vee (x \wedge z) \iff (x \vee y) \wedge (x \vee z). " /></p>
<p>		 Lorenat’s talk highlights a controversy between: Joseph Diaz Gergonne, Jean-Victor Poncelet, and Julius Plucker. Her work is <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/science-in-context/article/polemics-in-public-poncelet-gergonne-plucker-and-the-duality-controversy/C305E6B9326F2AC4C8AC31D4194FEDC6">here</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A plagiarism charge in 1827 sparked a public controversy centered between Jean-Victor Poncelet (1788-1867) and Joseph-Diez Gergonne (1771-1859) over the origin and applications of the principle of duality in geometry. Over the next three years and through the pages of various journals, monographs, letters, reviews, reports, and footnotes, vitriol between the antagonists increased as their potential publicity grew. While the historical literature offers valuable resources toward understanding the development, content, and applications of geometric duality, the hostile nature of the exchange seems to have deterred an in-depth textual study of the explicitly polemical writings. We argue that the necessary collective endeavor of beginning and ending this controversy constitutes a case study in the circulation of geometry. In particular, we consider how the duality controversy functioned as a medium of communicating new fundamental principles to a wider audience of practitioners. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
A further comment is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(projective_geometry)">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Of this feud, Pierre Samuel has quipped that since both men were in the French army and Poncelet was a general while Gergonne a mere captain, Poncelet’s view prevailed, at least among their French contemporaries. </em>

<p>Since I’m now feeling better that the first authoritarian coup attempt in US history will probably sort itself out OK, here’s a <em>real</em> problem:</p>



<p>Nearly a score years ago, I created the <a href="https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo">Complexity Zoo</a>, a procrastination project turned encyclopedia of complexity classes.  Nearly half a score years ago, the Zoo moved to my former employer, the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/">Institute for Quantum Computing</a> in Waterloo, Canada, which graciously hosted it ever since.  Alas, IQC has decided that it can no longer do so.  The reason is new regulations in Ontario about the accessibility of websites, which the Zoo might be out of compliance with.  My students and I were willing to look into what was needed—like, does the <a href="https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo:P#ph">polynomial hierarchy</a> need ramps between its levels or something?  The best would be if we heard from actual blind or other disabled complexity enthusiasts about how we could improve their experience, rather than trying to parse bureaucratese from the Ontario government.  But IQC informed us that in any case, they can’t deal with the potential liability and their decision is final.  I thank them for hosting the Zoo for eight years.</p>



<p>Now I’m looking for a volunteer for a new host.  The Zoo runs on the <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> platform, which doesn’t work with my own hosting provider (Bluehost) but is apparently easy to set up if you, unlike me, are the kind of person who can do such things.  The IQC folks kindly offered to help with the transfer; I and my students can help as well.  It’s a small site with modest traffic.  The main things I need are just assurances that you can host the site for a long time (“forever” or thereabouts), and that you or someone else in your organization will be reachable if the site goes down or if there are other problems.  I own the complexityzoo.com domain and can redirect from there.</p>



<p>In return, you’ll get the immense prestige of hosting such a storied resource for theoretical computer science … plus free publicity for your cause or organization on <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>, and the eternal gratitude of thousands of my readers.</p>



<p>Of course, if you’re <em>into</em> complexity theory, and you want to update or improve the Zoo while you’re at it, then so much the awesomer!  It could use some updates, badly.  But you don’t even <em>need</em> to know P from NP.</p>



<p>If you’re interested, leave a comment or shoot me an email.  Thanks!!</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Unrelated Announcement:</span></strong> I’ll once again be doing an Ask-Me-Anything session at the <a href="https://q2b.qcware.com/">Q2B (“Quantum to Business”)</a> conference, December 8-10.

<p><br />(Guest post by Shir Cohen and Mouna Safir)</p>



<p><br />The 34th International Symposium on Distributed Computing (DISC 2020) was held on October 12-16, 2020, as a virtual conference. As such, the opportunity for community members to get to know each other in an informal environment was lacking. To address this need, we arranged two types of virtual networking events. We hope that these events planted the seeds for many future collaborations and that there will be an opportunity for those involved to meet in person next time.</p>



<p><strong>MoPS (Meet other Postdoc and Students) Sessions<br /></strong>Webpage: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/disc2020mops/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://sites.google.com/view/disc2020mops/home</a></p>



<p>To allow junior members of the community to get to know one another, we arranged MoPS sessions, which we have not seen done before. There were more than 50 participants who took part in the sessions, with representation from a host of countries throughout the world. Sessions were held in 10-time slots before, during, and after DISC. In each session, there would typically be 5 members representing a mixture of Bachelor’s students, Masters students, PhDs, postdocs, and others. Care was taken to include at least one postdoc or Ph.D. in each session so that Bachelors and Masters students might benefit from their experience. Groups were formed with the goal of allowing participants from different countries and institutions to share their experiences and research journeys with one another. Based on the feedback for this event, it would appear that that goal was met and the participants came away with more of a sense of community.</p>



<p><strong>Junior-Senior Meetings<br /></strong>Webpage: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/disc2020junior-seniormeeting/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://sites.google.com/view/disc2020junior-seniormeeting/home</a></p>



<p>The Junior-Senior meetings were organized to provide an opportunity for junior researchers to meet with senior researchers. Fourteen sessions were conducted, where each one brought together one senior and 3-5 juniors. In these sessions,  the juniors got a chance to interact with seniors in the field and profit from their experience. Discussions covered a variety of topics such as how to approach research, how to deal with the job market, or perhaps more personal concerns like work-life balance. We collected amazing feedback from the participants, who claimed that this was a fruitful and interesting experience.</p></div>

Computational pseudorandomness studies the extent to which a random variable $\bf{Z}$ looks like the uniform distribution according to a class of tests $\cal{F}$. Computational entropy generalizes computational pseudorandomness by studying the extent which a random variable looks like a \emph{high entropy} distribution. There are different formal definitions of computational entropy with different advantages for different applications. Because of this, it is of interest to understand when these definitions are equivalent.
  We consider three notions of computational entropy which are known to be equivalent when the test class $\cal{F}$ is closed under taking majorities. This equivalence constitutes (essentially) the so-called \emph{dense model theorem} of Green and Tao (and later made explicit by Tao-Zeigler, Reingold et al., and Gowers). The dense model theorem plays a key role in Green and Tao's proof that the primes contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions and has since been connected to a surprisingly wide range of topics in mathematics and computer science, including cryptography, computational complexity, combinatorics and machine learning. We show that, in different situations where $\cal{F}$ is \emph{not} closed under majority, this equivalence fails. This in turn provides examples where the dense model theorem is \emph{false}.</div>

graphs is conjectured to be hard, it is natural to try and design fast
algorithms for restricted families of graphs. One such family that has been
extensively studied is that of graphs of bounded degeneracy (e.g., planar
graphs). This line of work, which started in the early 80's, culminated in a
recent work of Gishboliner et al., which highlighted the importance of the task
of counting homomorphic copies of cycles in graphs of bounded degeneracy.
</p>
<p>Our main result in this paper is a surprisingly tight relation between the
above task and the well-studied problem of detecting (standard) copies of
directed cycles in general directed graphs. More precisely, we prove the
following:
</p>
<p>1. One can compute the number of homomorphic copies of $C_{2k}$ and
$C_{2k+1}$ in $n$-vertex graphs of bounded degeneracy in time $O(n^{d_{k}})$,
where $d_k$ is the exponent of the fastest known algorithm for detecting
directed copies of $C_k$ in general $m$-edge digraphs.
</p>
<p>2. Conversely, one can transform any $n^{b_{k}}$ algorithm for computing the
number of homomorphic copies of $C_{2k}$ or of $C_{2k+1}$ in $n$-vertex graphs
of bounded degeneracy, into an $\tilde{O}(m^{b_{k}})$ time algorithm for
detecting directed copies of $C_k$ in general $m$-edge digraphs.
</p>
<p>We emphasize that our first result does not use a black-box reduction (as
opposed to the second result which does). Instead, we design an algorithm for
computing the number of $C_{2k}$-homomorphisms (or $C_{2k+1}$-homomorphisms) in
degenerate graphs and show that one part of its analysis can be reduced to the
analysis of the fastest known algorithm for detecting directed $k$-cycles in
general digraphs, which was carried out in a recent breakthrough of
Dalirrooyfard, Vuong and Vassilevska Williams.

information theoretical interest the game has to offer. Many results have been
discovered starting with Erd\H{o}s and R\'enyi determining the optimal number
of queries needed for two colors. For $k$ colors and $n$ positions, Chv\'atal
found asymptotically optimal bounds when $k \le n^{1-\epsilon}$. Following a
sequence of gradual improvements for $k \geq n$ colors, the central open
question is to resolve the gap between $\Omega(n)$ and $\mathcal{O}(n\log \log
n)$ for $k=n$.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we resolve this gap by presenting the first algorithm for
solving $k=n$ Mastermind with a linear number of queries. As a consequence, we
are able to determine the query complexity of Mastermind for any parameters $k$
and $n$.

capacity-achieving list decodable codes with both constant alphabet and
constant list sizes. More specifically, for any $R \in (0,1)$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$,
we give an algebraic construction of an infinite family of error-correcting
codes of rate $R$, over an alphabet of size $(1/\epsilon)^{O(1/\epsilon^2)}$,
that can be list decoded from a $(1-R-\epsilon)$-fraction of errors with list
size at most $\exp(\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon))$. Moreover, the codes can be
encoded in time $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon, n)$, the output list is contained in
a linear subspace of dimension at most $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)$, and a basis
for this subspace can be found in time $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon, n)$. Thus,
both encoding and list decoding can be performed in fully polynomial-time
$\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon, n)$, except for pruning the subspace and outputting
the final list which takes time
$\exp(\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon))\cdot\mathrm{poly}(n)$.
</p>
<p>Our codes are quite natural and structured. Specifically, we use
algebraic-geometric (AG) codes with evaluation points restricted to a subfield,
and with the message space restricted to a (carefully chosen) linear subspace.
Our main observation is that the output list of AG codes with subfield
evaluation points is contained in an affine shift of the image of a
block-triangular-Toeplitz (BTT) matrix, and that the list size can potentially
be reduced to a constant by restricting the message space to a BTT evasive
subspace, which is a large subspace that intersects the image of any BTT matrix
in a constant number of points. We further show how to explicitly construct
such BTT evasive subspaces, based on the explicit subspace designs of Guruswami
and Kopparty (Combinatorica, 2016), and composition.

ground energy of local Hamiltonians that do not suffer the so-called sign
problem. We provide a novel connection between $\mathsf{StoqMA}$ and the
distribution testing via reversible circuits. First, we prove that easy-witness
$\mathsf{StoqMA}$ (viz. $\mathsf{eStoqMA}$, a sub-class of $\mathsf{StoqMA}$)
is contained in $\mathsf{MA}$. Easy witness is a generalization of a subset
state such that the associated set's membership can be efficiently verifiable,
and all non-zero coordinates are not necessarily uniform. Second, by showing
distinguishing reversible circuits with random ancillary bits is
$\mathsf{StoqMA}$-complete (as a comparison, distinguishing quantum circuits is
$\mathsf{QMA}$-complete [JWB05]), we construct soundness error reduction of
$\mathsf{StoqMA}$. This new $\mathsf{StoqMA}$-complete problem further
signifies that $\mathsf{StoqMA}$ with perfect completeness
($\mathsf{StoqMA}_1$) is contained in $\mathsf{eStoqMA}$, which leads us to an
alternating proof for $\mathsf{StoqMA}_1 \subseteq \mathsf{MA}$ previously
proved in [BBT06, BT10]. Additionally, we show that both variants of
$\mathsf{StoqMA}$ that without any random ancillary bit and with perfect
soundness are contained in $\mathsf{NP}$. Our results make a step towards
collapsing the hierarchy $\mathsf{MA} \subseteq \mathsf{StoqMA} \subseteq
\mathsf{SBP}$ [BBT06], in which all classes are contained in $\mathsf{AM}$ and
collapse to $\mathsf{NP}$ under derandomization assumptions.

in scheduling. In this paper, we study the setting of a single machine with
preemptions. The input consists of a set of jobs, characterized by their
processing times, release times, and weights and we want to compute a (possibly
preemptive) schedule for them. The objective is to minimize the sum of the
weighted flow times of the jobs, where the flow time of a job is the time
between its release date and its completion time.
</p>
<p>It had been a long-standing open problem to find a polynomial time
$O(1)$-approximation algorithm for this setting. In a recent break-through
result, Batra, Garg, and Kumar (FOCS 2018) found such an algorithm if the input
data are polynomially bounded integers, and Feige, Kulkarni, and Li (SODA 2019)
presented a black-box reduction to this setting. The resulting approximation
ratio is a (not explicitly stated) constant which is at least $10.000$. In this
paper we improve this ratio to $2+\varepsilon$. The algorithm by Batra, Garg,
and Kumar (FOCS 2018) reduces the problem to Demand MultiCut on trees and
solves the resulting instances via LP-rounding and a dynamic program. Instead,
we first reduce the problem to a (different) geometric problem while losing
only a factor $1+\epsilon$, and then solve its resulting instances up to a
factor of $2+\epsilon$ by a dynamic program. In particular, our reduction
ensures certain structural properties, thanks to which we do not need
LP-rounding methods.
</p>
<p>We believe that our result makes substantial progress towards finding a PTAS
for weighted flow time on a single machine.

fundamental task in bioinformatics, but a formidable one when the text is a
highly compressed genomic database. Bannai et al. gave an efficient solution
for this case, which Rossi et al. recently implemented, but it uses two passes
over the patterns and buffers a pointer for each character during the first
pass. In this paper, we simplify their solution and make it streaming, at the
cost of slowing it down slightly. This means that, first, we can compute the
matching statistics of several long patterns (such as whole human chromosomes)
in parallel while still using a reasonable amount of RAM; second, we can
compute matching statistics online with low latency and thus quickly recognize
when a pattern becomes incompressible relative to the database.

problem: Suppose we are given a metric system (M, X), which contains k metrics
M = {\rho_1,..., \rho_k} defined on the same point set X. We aim to find a
maximum subset X' of X such that all metrics in M are "consistent" when
restricted on the subset X'. In particular, our definition of consistency will
rely only on the ordering between pairwise distances, and thus we call a
"consistent" subset an ordinal consensus of X w.r.t. M. We will introduce two
concepts of "consistency" in the ordinal sense: a strong one and a weak one.
Specifically, a subset X' is strongly consistent means that the ordering of
their pairwise distances is the same under each of the input metric \rho_i from
M. The weak consistency, on the other hand, relaxes this exact ordering
condition, and intuitively allows us to take the plurality of ordering relation
between two pairwise distances.
</p>
<p>We show in this paper that the maximum consensus problems over both the
strong and the weak consistency notions are NP-complete, even when there are
only 2 or 3 simple metrics, such as line metrics and ultrametrics. We also
develop constant-factor approximation algorithms for the dual version, the
minimum inconsistent subset problem of a metric system (M, P), - note that
optimizing these two dual problems are equivalent.

Hypothesis (SPCH), which postulates that any algorithm for planted clique must
run in time $n^{\Omega(\log{n})}$ (so that the state-of-the-art running time of
$n^{O(\log n)}$ is optimal up to a constant in the exponent).
</p>
<p>We provide two sets of applications of the new hypothesis. First, we show
that SPCH implies (nearly) tight inapproximability results for the following
well-studied problems in terms of the parameter $k$: Densest $k$-Subgraph,
Smallest $k$-Edge Subgraph, Densest $k$-Subhypergraph, Steiner $k$-Forest, and
Directed Steiner Network with $k$ terminal pairs. For example, we show, under
SPCH, that no polynomial time algorithm achieves $o(k)$-approximation for
Densest $k$-Subgraph. This inapproximability ratio improves upon the previous
best $k^{o(1)}$ factor from (Chalermsook et al., FOCS 2017). Furthermore, our
lower bounds hold even against fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with
parameter $k$.
</p>
<p>Our second application focuses on the complexity of graph pattern detection.
For both induced and non-induced graph pattern detection, we prove hardness
results under SPCH, which improves the running time lower bounds obtained by
(Dalirrooyfard et al., STOC 2019) under the Exponential Time Hypothesis.

</p>
<p>We develop unique and list decoding algorithms for (essentially) the family
of codes constructed by Ta-Shma. We prove the following results for
$\epsilon$-balanced codes with block length $N$ and rate
$\Omega(\epsilon^{2+\beta})$ in this family:
</p>
<p>- For all $\epsilon, \beta &gt; 0$ there are explicit codes which can be
uniquely decoded up to an error of half the minimum distance in time
$N^{O_{\epsilon, \beta}(1)}$.
</p>
<p>- For any fixed constant $\beta$ independent of $\epsilon$, there is an
explicit construction of codes which can be uniquely decoded up to an error of
half the minimum distance in time $(\log(1/\epsilon))^{O(1)} \cdot
N^{O_\beta(1)}$.
</p>
<p>- For any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, there are explicit $\epsilon$-balanced codes with
rate $\Omega(\epsilon^{2+\beta})$ which can be list decoded up to error $1/2 -
\epsilon'$ in time $N^{O_{\epsilon,\epsilon',\beta}(1)}$, where $\epsilon',
\beta \to 0$ as $\epsilon \to 0$.
</p>
<p>The starting point of our algorithms is the list decoding framework from Alev
et al. [SODA 2020], which uses the Sum-of-Squares SDP hierarchy. The rates
obtained there were quasipolynomial in $\epsilon$. Here, we show how to
overcome the far from optimal rates of this framework obtaining unique decoding
algorithms for explicit binary codes of near optimal rate. These codes are
based on simple modifications of Ta-Shma's construction.

theoretical point of view. We give some rigorous underpinnings to the
empirically observed phenomenon that combining cutting planes and branching
into a branch-and-cut framework can be orders of magnitude more efficient than
employing these tools on their own. In particular, we give general conditions
under which a cutting plane strategy and a branching scheme give a provably
exponential advantage in efficiency when combined into branch-and-cut. The
efficiency of these algorithms is evaluated using two concrete measures: number
of iterations and sparsity of constraints used in the intermediate
linear/convex programs. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first
mathematically rigorous demonstration of the superiority of branch-and-cut over
pure cutting planes and pure branch-and-bound.

through operations such as $k$-XOR applied to "local views" of codewords of
$\mathcal{C}$, according to a suitable $k$-uniform hypergraph. The $k$-XOR
operation yields the direct sum encoding used in works of [Ta-Shma, STOC 2017]
and [Dinur and Kaufman, FOCS 2017].
</p>
<p>We give a general framework for list decoding such lifted codes, as long as
the base code admits a unique decoding algorithm, and the hypergraph used for
lifting satisfies certain expansion properties. We show that these properties
are satisfied by the collection of length $k$ walks on an expander graph, and
by hypergraphs corresponding to high-dimensional expanders. Instantiating our
framework, we obtain list decoding algorithms for direct sum liftings on the
above hypergraph families. Using known connections between direct sum and
direct product, we also recover the recent results of Dinur et al. [SODA 2019]
on list decoding for direct product liftings.
</p>
<p>Our framework relies on relaxations given by the Sum-of-Squares (SOS) SDP
hierarchy for solving various constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). We view
the problem of recovering the closest codeword to a given word, as finding the
optimal solution of a CSP. Constraints in the instance correspond to edges of
the lifting hypergraph, and the solutions are restricted to lie in the base
code $\mathcal{C}$. We show that recent algorithms for (approximately) solving
CSPs on certain expanding hypergraphs also yield a decoding algorithm for such
lifted codes.
</p>
<p>We extend the framework to list decoding, by requiring the SOS solution to
minimize a convex proxy for negative entropy. We show that this ensures a
covering property for the SOS solution, and the "condition and round" approach
used in several SOS algorithms can then be used to recover the required list of
codewords.

near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computers. In this work, we consider a
well-studied quantum algorithm for combinatorial optimization: the Quantum
Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) applied to the MaxCut problem on
3-regular graphs. We explore the idea of improving the solutions returned by
the simplest version of the algorithm (depth-1 QAOA) using a form of
postselection that can be efficiently simulated by state preparation. We derive
theoretical upper and lower bounds showing that a constant (though small)
increase of the fraction of satisfied edges is indeed achievable. Numerical
experiments on large problem instances (beyond classical simulatability)
complement and support our bounds. We also consider a distinct technique: local
updates, which can be applied not only to QAOA but any optimization algorithm.
In the case of QAOA, the resulting improvement can be sharply quantified
theoretically for large problem instances and in absence of postselection.
Combining postselection and local updates, the theory is no longer tractable
but numerical evidence suggests that improvements from both methods can be
combined.

Harish-Chandra--Itzykson--Zuber (HCIZ) density on the unitary group
$\mathrm{U}(n)$ is $e^{\mathrm{Tr}(U \Lambda U^*Y)}d\mu(U)$ where $\mu$ is the
Haar measure on $\mathrm{U}(n)$. Random unitary matrices distributed according
to the HCIZ density are important in various settings in physics and random
matrix theory. However, the basic question of how to sample efficiently from
the HCIZ density has remained open. The main contribution of this paper is an
algorithm to sample a matrix from a distribution that is $\varepsilon$-close to
the given HCIZ density and whose running time depends polylogarithmically on
$1/\varepsilon$. Interestingly, HCIZ densities can also be viewed as
exponential densities on $\mathrm{U}(n)$-orbits, and in this setting, they have
been widely studied. Thus, our result has several direct applications,
including polynomial-time algorithms 1) to sample from matrix Langevin
distributions studied in statistics, 2) to sample from continuous maximum
entropy distributions with applications to quantum inference, and 3) for
differentially private low-rank approximation.
</p>
<p>The key obstacle in sampling from an HCIZ density is that the domain is an
algebraic manifold and the entries of the sample matrix are highly correlated.
To overcome this, we consider a mapping that sends each Hermitian matrix $X$ to
a natural ordering of the eigenvalues of all leading principal minors of $X$.
The image of each $\mathrm{U}(n)$-orbit under this map is a convex polytope,
and the mapping reveals a recursive structure of $\mathrm{U}(n)$-orbits.
Subsequently, we develop efficiently computable determinantal expressions for
densities that arise in the intermediate steps of sampling from the polytope.
Our proof-technique applies to other compact Lie groups and can be viewed as
extending the widely studied notion of self-reducibility.

in fixed-parameter tractable algorithms in various communities including
combinatorics, integer-linear programming, and numerical analysis. Many NP-hard
problems are known to be solvable in $\widetilde{O}(n \cdot
2^{O(\mathrm{tw})})$ time, where $\mathrm{tw}$ is the treewidth of the input
graph. Analogously, many problems in P should be solvable in $\widetilde{O}(n
\cdot \mathrm{tw}^{O(1)})$ time; however, due to the lack of appropriate tools,
only a few such results are currently known. [Fom+18] conjectured this to hold
as broadly as all linear programs; in our paper, we show this is true:
</p>
<p>Given a linear program of the form $\min_{Ax=b,\ell \leq x\leq u} c^{\top}
x$, and a width-$\tau$ tree decomposition of a graph $G_A$ related to $A$, we
show how to solve it in time
</p>
<p>$$\widetilde{O}(n \cdot \tau^2 \log (1/\varepsilon)),$$ where $n$ is the
number of variables and $\varepsilon$ is the relative accuracy. Combined with
existing techniques in vertex separators, this leads to algorithms with
$\widetilde{O}(n \cdot \mathrm{tw}^4 \log (1/\varepsilon))$ and
$\widetilde{O}(n \cdot \mathrm{tw}^2 \log (1/\varepsilon) + n^{1.5})$ run-times
when a tree decomposition is not given. Besides being the first of its kind,
our algorithm has run-time nearly matching the fastest run-time for solving the
sub-problem $Ax=b$ (under the assumption that no fast matrix multiplication is
used).
</p>
<p>We obtain these results by combining recent techniques in interior-point
methods (IPMs), sketching, and a novel representation of the solution under a
multiscale basis similar to the wavelet basis. This representation further
yields the first IPM with $o(\operatorname{rank}(A))$ time per iteration when
the treewidth is small.

query set of vertices, requires to find a cohesive (or dense) subgraph
containing the query vertices. In this paper we study the problem of community
search in temporal dynamic networks. We adapt to the temporal setting the
notion of \emph{network inefficiency} which is based on the pairwise
shortest-path distance among all the vertices in a solution. For this purpose
we define the notion of \emph{shortest-fastest-path distance}: a linear
combination of the temporal and spatial dimensions governed by a user-defined
parameter. We thus define the \textsc{Minimum Temporal-Inefficiency Subgraph}
problem and show that it is \NPhard. We develop an algorithm which exploits a
careful transformation of the temporal network to a static directed and
weighted graph, and some recent approximation algorithm for finding the minimum
Directed Steiner Tree. We finally generalize our framework to the streaming
setting in which new snapshots of the temporal graph keep arriving continuously
and our goal is to produce a community search solution for the temporal graph
corresponding to a sliding time window.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:  We present very general lower bounds for parametric estimation when only limited information per sample is allowed. These limitations can arise, for example, in form of communication constraints, privacy constraints, or linear measurements. Our lower bounds hold for discrete distributions with large alphabet as well as continuous distributions with high-dimensional parameters, apply for any information constraint, and are valid for any $\ell_p$ loss function. Our bounds recover both strong data processing inequality based bounds and Cramér-Rao based bound as special cases.</p>

Higher order random walks (HD-walks) on high dimensional expanders have played a crucial role in a number of recent breakthroughs in theoretical computer science, perhaps most famously in the recent resolution of the Mihail-Vazirani conjecture (Anari et al. STOC 2019), which focuses on HD-walks on one-sided local-spectral expanders. In this work we study the spectral structure of walks on the stronger two-sided variant, which capture wide generalizations of important objects like the Johnson and Grassmann graphs. We prove that the spectra of these walks are tightly concentrated in a small number of strips, each of which corresponds combinatorially to a level in the underlying complex. Moreover, the eigenvalues corresponding to these strips decay exponentially with a measure we term the depth of the walk.
    
    Using this spectral machinery, we characterize the edge-expansion of small sets based upon the interplay of their local combinatorial structure and the global decay of the walk's eigenvalues across strips. Variants of this result for the special cases of the Johnson and Grassmann graphs were recently crucial both for the resolution of the 2-2 Games Conjecture (Khot et al. FOCS 2018), and for efficient algorithms for affine unique games over the Johnson graphs (Bafna et al. Arxiv 2020). For the complete complex, our characterization admits a low-degree Sum of Squares proof. Building on the work of Bafna et al., we provide the first polynomial time algorithm for affine unique games over the Johnson scheme. The soundness and runtime of our algorithm depend upon the number of strips with large eigenvalues, a measure we call High-Dimensional Threshold Rank that calls back to the seminal work of Barak, Raghavendra, and Steurer (FOCS 2011) on unique games and threshold rank.</div>

We present an explicit and efficient algebraic construction of capacity-achieving list decodable codes with both constant alphabet and constant list sizes. More specifically, for any $R \in (0,1)$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$, we give an algebraic construction of an infinite family of error-correcting codes of rate $R$, over an alphabet of size $(1/\epsilon)^{O(1/\epsilon^2)}$, that can be list decoded from a $(1-R-\epsilon)$-fraction of errors with list size at most $\exp(\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon))$. Moreover, the codes can be encoded in time $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon, n)$, the output list is contained in a linear subspace of dimension at most $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)$, and a basis for this subspace can be found in time $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon, n)$. Thus, both encoding and list decoding can be performed in \emph{fully polynomial-time} $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon, n)$, except for pruning the subspace and outputting the final list which takes time $\exp(\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)) \cdot \mathrm{poly}(n)$. In contrast, prior explicit and efficient constructions of capacity-achieving list decodable codes either required a much higher complexity in terms of $1/\epsilon$ (and were additionally much less structured), or had super-constant alphabet or list sizes.

Our codes are quite natural and structured. Specifically, we use algebraic-geometric (AG) codes with evaluation points restricted to a subfield, and with the message space restricted to a (carefully chosen) linear subspace. Our main observation is that the output list of AG codes with subfield evaluation points is contained in an affine shift of the image of a \emph{block-triangular-Toeplitz (BTT) matrix}, and that the list size can potentially be reduced to a constant by restricting the message space to a \emph{BTT evasive subspace}, which is a large subspace that intersects the image of any BTT matrix in a constant number of points. We further show how to explicitly construct such BTT evasive subspaces, based on the explicit subspace designs of Guruswami and Kopparty (\emph{Combinatorica}, 2016), and composition.</div>

This paper shows that there exist Reed--Solomon (RS) codes, over large finite fields, that are combinatorially list-decodable well beyond the Johnson radius, in fact almost achieving list-decoding capacity. In particular, we show that for any $\epsilon\in (0,1]$ there exist RS codes with rate $\Omega(\frac{\epsilon}{\log(1/\epsilon)+1})$ that are list-decodable from radius of $1-\epsilon$. We generalize this result to obtain a similar result on list-recoverability of RS codes. Along the way we use our techniques to give a new proof of a result of Blackburn on optimal linear perfect hash matrices, and strengthen it to obtain a construction of strongly perfect hash matrices. 

To derive the results in this paper we show a surprising connection of the above problems to graph theory, and in particular to the tree packing theorem of Nash-Williams and Tutte. En route to our results on RS codes, we prove a generalization of the tree packing theorem to hypergraphs (and we conjecture that an even stronger generalization holds). We hope that this generalization to hypergraphs will be of independent interest.</div>

<p>As announced <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/09/20/announcing-a-short-course-in-paris/">earlier</a> I am currently teaching a course on “interactive proofs with quantum devices” in Paris. The course is proceeding apace, even though the recent lockdown order in France means that we had to abandon our beautiful auditorium at the Institut Henri Poincaré and retreat behind the fanciful Zoom backgrounds whose pretension is a sad reminder of what our summers used to be (Banff, anyone?). A possible upshot is that more may be able to attend the now-online course; if you are interested see the <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/teaching/fsmp/">course page</a> for info. (Things are actually fairly good here–in spite of the apparently strict restrictions on daily outings (max 1h, 1km) you can count on the French to bend things their way; most shops are closed but the streets remain quite busy.)</p>



<p>We just finished a sequence of four lectures on the Mahadev “classical verification of quantum computation” protocol. In the process of preparing the lectures I arrived at a presentation of the protocol that is fairly self-contained, so I decided to compile the associated lecture notes as a stand-alone group of 4 lectures that is available <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/teaching/fsmp/fsmp_verification.pdf">here</a>. The notes are aimed at beginning graduate students with a first course in quantum computing and in complexity desiring to gain a concrete understanding of the inner workings of the result; the notes are a bit lengthy but this in part because they take the time to introduce related concepts and slowly build up to the main result. Overall, my hope is that these should be relatively easily readable and provide a good technical introduction to the Mahadev result on classical verification, including an almost complete analysis of her protocol (there are a few explicitly declared shortcuts that help simplify the presentation without hiding any important aspects). For additional background you can also consult the full <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/teaching/fsmp/fsmp.pdf">10-week notes</a>. Comments on the notes are welcome; I’m afraid they most likely contain numerous typos so if you find any please feel free to correct them directly on the associated <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/9892211158zrwmqnxtvcxm">overleaf document</a>.</p>



<p>The last three lectures of the course will be devoted to the problem of testing under spatial assumptions, building up to an introduction to the proof of MIP* = RE. If all goes well I’ll aim to prepare some stand-alone notes for that part as well.</p></div>

<p>Today’s online world and the emerging internet of things is built around a Faustian bargain:  consumers (and their internet of things) hand over their data, and in return get customization of the world to their needs.  Is this exchange of privacy for convenience inherent? At first sight one sees no way around because, of course, to allow machine learning on our data we have to hand our data over to the training algorithm.</p>

<p>Similar issues arise in settings other than consumer devices. For instance, hospitals may wish to pool together their patient data to train a large deep model. But privacy laws such as HIPAA forbid them from sharing the data itself, so somehow they have to train a deep net on their data without revealing their data. Frameworks such as Federated Learning (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05492">Konečný et al., 2016</a>) have been proposed for this but it is known that sharing gradients in that environment leaks a lot of information about the data (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08935">Zhu et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p>Methods to achieve some of the above  so could completely change the privacy/utility tradeoffs implicit in today’s organization of the online world.</p>

<p>This blog post discusses the current set of solutions,  how they don’t quite suffice for above questions, and the story of a new solution, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02772">InstaHide</a>, that we proposed, and takeaways from a recent attack on it by Carlini et al.</p>

<h2 id="existing-solutions-in-cryptography">Existing solutions in Cryptography</h2>

<p>Classic solutions in cryptography do allow you to in principle outsource any computation to the cloud without revealing your data. (A modern method is Fully Homomorphic Encryption.) Adapting these ideas to machine learning  presents two major obstacles: (a) (serious issue) huge computational overhead, which essentially rules it out for today’s large scale deep models (b) (less serious issue) need for special setups —e.g., requiring every user to sign up for public-key encryption.</p>

<p>Significant research efforts are being made to try to overcome these obstacles and we won’t survey them here.</p>

<h2 id="differential-privacy-dp">Differential Privacy (DP)</h2>

<p>Differential privacy (<a href="https://www.iacr.org/archive/eurocrypt2006/40040493/40040493.pdf">Dwork et al., 2006</a>, <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf">Dwork&amp;Roth, 2014</a>) involves adding carefully calculated amounts of noise during training. This is a modern and rigorous version of classic    <em>data anonymization</em> techniques whose canonical application is release of noised census data to protect privacy of individuals.</p>

<p>This notion was adapted to machine learning by positing that “privacy” in machine learning refers to trained classifiers not being dependent on data of individuals. In other words, if the classifier is trained on data from N individuals, it’s behavior should be essentially unchanged (statistically speaking) if we omit data from any individual. Note that this is a weak notion of privacy: it does not in any way hide the data from the company.</p>

<p>Many tech companies have adopted differential privacy in deployed systems but the following two caveats are important.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Caveat 1): In deep learning applications, DP’s provable guarantees are very weak.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Applying DP to deep learning involves noticing that the gradient computation amounts to adding gradients of the loss corresponding to individual data points, and that adding noise to those individual gradients in calculated doses can help make the overall classifier limit its dependence on the individual’s datapoint.</p>

<p>In practice provable bounds require adding so much gradient noise that accuracy of the trained classifier plummets. We do not know of any successful training that achieved accuracy &gt; 75 percent on CIFAR10 (or any that achieved accuracy even 10 percent on ImageNet). Furthermore, achieving this level of accuracy involves <strong>pretraining</strong> the classifier model on a large set of <strong>public</strong> images and then using the private/protected images  only to fine-tune the parameters.</p>

<p>Thus it is no surprise that firms today usually apply DP with very low noise level, which give essentially no guarantees. Which brings us to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Caveat 2): DP’s guarantees (and even weaker guarantees applying to deployment scenarios) possibly act as a fig leaf that allows firms to not address  the kinds of privacy violations that the person on the street actually worries about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>DP’s provable guarantee (which as noted, does not hold in deployed systems due to the low noise level used) would only ensure that  a deployed ML software that was trained with data from tens of millions of users will not accidentally reveal private information of any user.</p>

<p>But that threat model would seem remote to the person on the street. The privacy issue they worry about more is that copious amounts of our data are continuously collected/stored/mined/sold, often by entities we do not even know about. While  lax regulation is primarily to blame,  there is also the technical hurdle  that  there  is no <strong>practical way</strong> for consumers to hide their data while at the same time benefiting from customized ML solutions that improve their lives.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the question we started with: <em>Could consumers allow machine learning to be done on their data without revealing their data?</em></p>

<h2 id="a-proposed-solution-instahide">A proposed solution: InstaHide</h2>

<p>InstaHide is a new concept: it hides or “encrypts” images to protect them somewhat,  while still allowing standard deep learning pipelines to be applied on them. The deep model is trained entirely on encrypted images.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The training speed and accuracy is only slightly worse than vanilla training: one can achieve a test accuracy of ~ 90 percent on CIFAR10 using encrypted images with a computation overhead $&lt; 5$ percent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it comes to privacy, like every other form of cryptography, its security is based upon conjectured difficulty of the underlying computational problem.
(But we don’t expect breaking it to be as difficult as say breaking RSA.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-instahide-encryption-works">How InstaHide encryption works</h3>

<p>Here are some details. InstaHide  belongs to the class of subset-sum type encryptions (<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/dwoodruf/www/biwx.pdf">Bhattacharyya et al., 2011</a>), and was inspired by a data augmentation technique called Mixup (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412">Zhang et al., 2018</a>). It views images as vectors of pixel values. With vectors you can take linear combinations. The figure below shows the result of a typical MixUp: adding  0.6 times the bird image  with 0.4 times the airplane image. The image labels can also be treated as one-hot vectors, and they are mixed using the same coefficients in front of the image samples.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img width="60%" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/mixup.png" />
</p>

<p>To encrypt the bird image, InstaHide does mixup (i.e., combination with nonnegative coefficients) with one other randomly chosen training image, and with two  other images chosen randomly from a large public dataset like imagenet.  The coefficients 0.6., 0.4 etc. in the figure  are also chosen at random. Then it takes this composite image and for every pixel value, it randomly flips the sign. With that, we get the encrypted images and labels. All random choices made in this encryption act as a one-time key that is never re-used to encrypt other images.</p>

<p>InstaHide has a parameter $k$ denoting how many images are mixed; in the picture, we have $k=4$. The figure below shows this encryption mechanism.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img width="80%" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/instahide.png" />
</p>

<p>When plugged into the standard deep learning with a private dataset of $n$ images, in each epoch of training (say $T$ epochs in total), InstaHide will re-encrypt each image in the  dataset using a random one-time key. This will gives $n\times T$ encrypted images in total.</p>

<h3 id="the-security-argument">The security argument</h3>

<p>We conjectured, based upon intuitions from computational complexity of the k-vector-subset-sum problem (citations), that extracting information about the images could time $N^{k-2}$. Here $N$, the size of the public dataset, can be tens or hundreds of millions, so it might be infeasible for real-life attackers.</p>

<p>We also released a <a href="https://github.com/Hazelsuko07/InstaHide_Challenge">challenge dataset</a> with $k=6, n=100, T=50$ to enable further investigation of InstaHide’s security.</p>

<h2 id="carlini-et-als-recent-attack-on-instahide">Carlini et al.’s recent attack on InstaHide</h2>

<p>Recently, Carlini et al. have shared with us a manuscript with a two-step reconstruction attack (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05315.pdf">Carlini et al., 2020</a>)  against InstaHide.</p>

<p><strong><em>TL;DR: They used 11 hours on Google’s best GPUs to get partial recovery of our 100 challenge encryptions and  120 CPU hours to break the encryption completely. Furthermore, the latter was possible entirely because we used an insecure random number generator, and they used exhaustive search over random seeds.</em></strong></p>

<p>Now the details.</p>

<p>The attack takes $n\times T$ InstaHide-encrypted images as the input, ($n$ is the size of the private dataset, $T$ is the number of training epochs), and returns a reconstruction of the private dataset. It goes as follows.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Map $n \times T$ encryptions into $n$ private images, by clustering encryptions of a same private image as a group. This is achieved by firstly building a graph representing pairwise similarity between encrypted images, and then assign each encryption a private image. In their implementation, they train a neural network to annotate pairwise similarity between encryptions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, given the encrypted images and the mapping, they solve a nonlinear optimization problem via gradient desent to recover an approximation of the original private dataset.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Using Google’s powerful GPU, it took them 10 hours to train the neural network for similarity annotation, and about another hour to get an approximation of our challenge set of $100$ images with $k=6, n=100, T=50$. This gave them vaguely correct images, with significant unclear areas and color shift.</p>

<p>They also proposed a different strategy which abuses the vulnerability of NumPy and PyTorch’s random number generator (<em>Aargh; we didn’t use a secure random number generator.</em>) They did  brute force search of $2^{32}$ possible initial random seeds, which allows them to reproduce the randomness during encryption, and thus perform a pixel-perfect reconstruction. As they reported, this attack takes 120 CPU hours (they parallelize across 100 cores to obtain the solution in a little over an hour). We will have this implementation flaw fixed in an updated version.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts-on-this-attack">Thoughts on this attack</h3>

<p>Though the attack is clever and impressive, we feel that the long-term take-away is still unclear for several reasons.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Variants of InstaHide seem to evade the attack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The challenge set contained 50 encryptions each of 100 images. This corresponds to using encrypted images for 50 epochs. But as done in existing settings that use DP, one can pretrain the deep model using non-private images and then fine-tune it with fewer epochs of the private images. Using a similar pipeline DPSGD (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00133">Abadi et al., 2016</a>), by pretraining a ResNet-18 on CIFAR100 (the public dataset) and finetuning  for $10$ epochs on CIFAR10 (the private dataset)  gives accuracy of 83 percent, still far better than any provable guarantees using DP on this dataset. Carlini et al.\ team conceded that their attack probably would not work in this setting.</p>

<p>Similarly using InstaHide purely at inference time (i.e., using ML, instead of training ML) still should be completely secure since only one encryption of the image is released. The Google attack can’t work here at all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>InstaHide was never intended to be a mission-critical encryption like RSA (which by the way also has no provable guarantees).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>InstaHide is designed to give users and the internet of things a <em>light-weight</em> encryption method that allows them to use machine learning without giving eavesdroppers or servers access to their raw data. There is no other cost-effective alternative to InstaHide for this application. If it takes Google’s powerful computers a few hours  to break our challenge set of 100 images, this is not yet a cost-effective attack  in the intended settings.</p>

<p>More important, the challenge dataset corresponded to an ambitious form of security, where the encrypted images themselves are released to the world. The more typical application is a Federated Learning (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05492">Konečný et al., 2016</a>) scenario: the adversary observes shared gradients that are computed using encrypted images (he also has access to the trained model). The attacks in this paper do not currently apply to that scenario. This is also the idea in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06053"><strong>TextHide</strong></a>, an adaptation of InstaHide to text data.</p>

<h2 id="takeways">Takeways</h2>

<p>Users need lightweight encryptions that can be applied in real time to large amounts of data, and yet allow them to take benefit of Machine Learning on the cloud. Methods to do so could completely change the privacy/utility tradeoffs implicitly assumed in today’s tech world.</p>

<p>InstaHide is the only such tool right now, and we now know that it provides moderate security that may be enough for many applications.</p></div>

<p>My latest preprint is “Stack-number is not bounded by queue-number”, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04195">arXiv:2011.04195</a>, with Vida Dujmović, Robert Hickingbotham, Pat Morin, and David R. Wood; Hickingbotham is an undergraduate student of Wood at Monash University. It solves a question implicit in the work of Heath, Leighton and Rosenberg (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/0405031">1992</a>) on whether graphs of bounded queue number have bounded stack number (they don’t), disproves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blankenship%E2%80%93Oporowski_conjecture">a conjecture of Blankenship and Oporowski</a> (1999) on whether subdividing a graph of unbounded stack number can reduce its stack number to bounded (it can), and answers a question of Bonnet, Geniet, Kim, Thomassé, and Watrigant (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09877">to appear at SODA 2021</a>) on whether graphs of unbounded stacknumber can have bounded sparse twin-width (they can). And it does so in part using an old trick from combinatorial game theory from a mathematician who won a Nobel prize for his work in game theory. But what are stack number and queue number? And what could combinatorial games possibly have to do with these sorts of questions in structural graph theory?</p>

<p>The game in question is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)">Hex</a>, in which two players take turns placing their stones on hexagonal cells connected into a triangular grid and arranged in a rhombus. Each player tries to form a path of stones connecting two sides of the rhombus while simultaneously trying to block the other player from making a path. The rendering below from <a href="https://www.hexwiki.net/">HexWiki</a> shows a Hex board with a game in progress:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/HexWiki.jpg" alt="CC-BY-SA POV-Ray image of a Hex game, by Twixter on HexWiki, from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hexposition02.jpg and https://www.hexwiki.net/index.php/File:Hexposition02.jpg" /></p>

<p>In tic-tac-toe, a similar game on a square grid, both players can end up blocking each other, producing a drawn game. But as John Nash famously proved in 1952, this can’t happen in Hex: every game ends with one or the other player forming a path. This inability to draw is usually explained as a topological property of disks in the plane, equivalent to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brouwer_fixed-point_theorem">Brouwer fixed-point theorem</a>, although it also has a simple combinatorial proof involving walking along the boundary between the two colors of stones on a filled board, starting from a corner of the rhombus, and observing that the walk can only end at a non-opposite corner. But the lack of draws also implies the following statement about graphs: if you form a large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_tiling">triangular grid</a> (the graph of positions and adjacencies of stones in Hex), and label its vertices with two colors (the colors of the stones of the two Hex players), then it must contain a long path: at least long enough to reach from one side of the Hex board to the other.</p>

<p>The same combinatorial proof for the Hex board works for any planar triangulation of a disk whose boundary can be divided into four paths with opposite pairs of paths far apart. Even some outerplanar graphs have the same long-path property. Suppose, for instance, that an outerplanar triangulated disk has a complete binary tree for its dual graph. Then we can form a long path by starting at a vertex of the root triangle and repeatedly walking down the tree, at each step moving to a neighbor of the same color whose triangle is closest in the dual tree. This walk takes a long step (such as the step on the top edge of the red path shown below) only when stepping from a vertex whose neighbors include a long path of the other color (the blue path shown below), and otherwise it takes many steps.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/outerplanar-path-property.svg" alt="An outerplanar graph in which every 2-coloring has a long monochromatic path" /></p>

<p>On the other hand, the square grid or other bipartite graphs don’t have the long path property, because if you color them bipartitely then there are no nontrivial monochromatic paths. Neither do subcubic graphs, because their maximum cuts always partition them into two subsets whose longest path has length at most one. The Hex board graph turns out to be the right choice for our purposes, because as well as the long path property it has bounded degree (unlike the outerplanar example) and a nice regular planar structure making stack and queue layouts easy.</p>

<p>So what are these layouts? Stack layout is another name for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_embedding">book embedding</a>, in which the vertices of a graph are arranged in a line and its edges are placed without crossings into “pages”, half-planes bounded by the line. If you traverse the vertices of the graph in the order of the line, add an edge to its page when you traverse its first endpoint, and remove an edge from the page when you traverse the second endpoint, then the order of additions and removals is last-in-first-out, the same as a stack. The stack number or book thickness is the smallest number of pages you need to construct a layout like this. Below is an <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2015/10/03/why-shallow-minors.html">example I’ve used before</a>, a 3-page book embedding of the complete graph \(K_5\), whose stack number is three:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2015/3page-K5.svg" alt="Book embedding" /></p>

<p>If you replace the last-in-first-out ordering of additions and removals in a stack by first-in-first-out ordering, you get a queue. So a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_number">queue layout</a> is just an ordering of the vertices into a line, and a partition of the edges into “pages”, so that the traversal of the vertices by their line order produces a queue ordering of additions and removals of edges within each page. As <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007%2F978-3-642-18469-7_7">Auer et al described at GD 2010</a>, these layouts can also be described topologically, by representing each page as a cylinder with the line going longitudinally along it, and requiring each edge to be placed in such a way that it loops all the way around the cylinder. The queue number is the minimum number of these queues, or cylindrical pages, that you need to organize the graph in this way. It’s also closely related to the compact layout of graphs in 3d.</p>

<p>Below is an example I recently drew for a new Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuffle-exchange_network">shuffle-exchange networks</a>. These are very nonplanar graphs, but the layout shown can almost be drawn without crossings on two cylinders (one for the edges that bend around the left side of the vertices, another for the edges on the right) or on a single surface with a figure-eight cross-section, formed by gluing two cylinders together on a line. However, this only takes care of the curved edges. If you look closely, there are also short horizontal edges between consecutive vertices, which in a queue layout would need to wrap around another third cylinder. So these graphs have queue number at most three.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/Order-4_shuffle-exchange.svg" alt="Shuffle-exchange network" /></p>

<p>With all that as background, the central example in our new preprint is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product_of_graphs">Cartesian product</a> of a triangular grid with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_(graph_theory)">star</a>. It looks like this, but possibly with a bigger grid or star:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/star-times-hex.svg" alt="Cartesian product of a star with a triangular grid" /></p>

<p>The reason Cartesian products are useful in this context is that they behave nicely for queue layouts but not quite as nicely for stack layouts. If two graphs \(G\) and \(H\) both have queue layouts with a bounded number of queues, and in addition the layout of \(H\) is <em>strict</em>, meaning that within each page, each vertex has at most one earlier and one later neighbor, then we can lay out their product by grouping the vertices of the product into copies of \(G\) and placing each copy separately, with the order of the copies determined by the layout of \(H\). The resulting layout will still have a bounded queue number.  The star has bounded queue number, but its layouts are not strict, because it has high degree at the center of the star. As a planar graph the triangular grid has bounded queue number, and because it also has bounded degree its layouts can be made strict. Therefore, the product graph again has bounded queue number.</p>

<p>For stack layouts, a similar product layout works, but only when \(H\) is bipartite. We can reverse the ordering within the copies of \(G\) coming from one side of the bipartition, and the edges going from one copy to another will still be stack-ordered. But when \(H\) is not bipartite, there is no way to consistently choose which copies of \(G\) to reverse. The long path property of Hex boards, in some sense, provides a quantitative measure for the fact that their graphs are far from being bipartite.</p>

<p>Of course, this only shows that a certain stack layout doesn’t work, not that all layouts fail. Our proof that all stack layouts of our product graph fail proceeds in a sequence of reductions in which we assume we are given a layout, and successively reduce it to more-constrained layouts on smaller graphs until reaching a contradiction. The first reductions use the pigeonhole principle to find products of the grid with a smaller star, in which all leaf copies of the grid have the same layout. Next we use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Szekeres_theorem">Erdős–Szekeres theorem</a> to find a product with an even smaller star, in which each copy of the star is consistently ordered by the layout in one of two ways. Finally, we use the result about long paths in Hex to find a product of this small star with a path, in which all copies of the star are consistently ordered in the same way, and prove that this ordering of this graph cannot have a bounded stack number.</p>

<p>Heath, Leighton and Rosenberg introduced both stack number and queue number in their 1992 work, and provided an example for which the stack number is exponentially bigger than the queue number, naturally raising the question whether even bigger separations are possible. Our work settles this question by showing that there is no function (exponential or otherwise) that can be used to bound stack number as a function of queue number. In the opposite direction, Heath, Leighton &amp; Rosenberg conjectured that queue number cannot be made to grow significantly more quickly than stack number, but this remains open.</p>

<p>In 1999, Blankenship and Oporowski observed that subdividing the edges of a graph can lead to better stack layouts: for instance adding a single subdivision point to each edge of a complete graph reduces the stack number from linear to the square root of the number of vertices. They conjectured that this improvement cannot be too extreme: reducing the stack number from non-constant to constant should require a non-constant number of subdivision points. Our example disproves the Blankenship–Oporowski conjecture. The star-triangular grid product graph has non-constant stack number, but because it has bounded queue number its subdivisions with three subdivision points per edge have bounded stack number, according to a result of Dujmović and Wood (<a href="https://dmtcs.episciences.org/346">2005</a>). The same paper of Dujmović and Wood also stated the question of whether stack number can be bounded by a function of queue number more explicitly.</p>

<p>The definition of twin-width is too technical to summarize here; see the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09877">forthcoming SODA paper by Bonnet et al.</a>, which shows among other results that it is bounded for graphs of bounded stack number. Our results show that this is not an equivalence: there exist graphs (including the star-triangular grid products) that have unbounded stack number, but still have bounded sparse twin-width.</p>

<h2>Sensitivity of voting schemes to mistakes and manipulations</h2>
<p>Do the results of the recent election accurately reflect public opinion?<br />
Or are they the result of some minor local manipulations, and a few random<br />
mistakes such as voters confusion, or counting errors.</p>
<p>There are many potential schemes for electing a president, each with its<br />
own features. One important feature of a scheme is the agreement of the<br />
actual outcome of the election with the outcome of the ideal<br />
implementation of the election which disregards potential mistakes and<br />
mischief. If it is probable that the ideal and the actual outcomes differ,<br />
then frequently the outcome of the election will be in doubt.</p>
<p>In recent years, some mathematical efforts have been devoted to trying to<br />
understand which procedures are “stable” to these potential perturbations<br />
and which are “sensitive”. While the motivation for these studies came<br />
from questions in probability and statistical physics, These mathematical<br />
studies can shed some light on the current presidential election. In<br />
particular, a recent paper by Professors Itai Benjamini and Oded Schramm<br />
from Microsoft research and the Weizmann Institute and Gil Kalai from the<br />
Hebrew University of Jerusalem, soon to be published in the prestigious<br />
French journal Publication I.H.E.S., suggests that the “popular vote”<br />
method is much more stable against mistakes than other voting method.</p>
<p>One example of a decision procedure that we encounter in nature is the<br />
neuron. The neuron has to make its decisions based on many inputs; each<br />
represents the strength of electrical currents at the synapses entering<br />
the neuron. Based on these inputs, the neuron should decide whether to<br />
fire its axon going out of the neuron. It is quite likely that some small<br />
perturbations occur at each of the input synapses. It is therefore<br />
expected that the decision procedure of the neuron will be “stable” to<br />
these perturbations.</p>
<p>Experimental evidence indicates that neurons may be modeled as the<br />
following simple procedure. The neuron looks at some weighted sum of its<br />
inputs and makes a decision according to how large this sum is . If the<br />
sum is large, then one decision is made , while if it is small another<br />
decision is made .</p>
<p>The counterpart of this procedure for elections would be counting the<br />
votes and deciding according to the majority of the votes. Mathematical<br />
proofs have been given to show that this decision procedure is the most<br />
stable among all decision procedures.</p>
<p>More complicated neural networks consist of a hierarchy of neurons where<br />
the outputs of neurons in lower levels of the hierarchy are the inputs to<br />
neurons in the higher levels. Some of these networks have been proven to<br />
be much more sensitive to noise than a single neuron.</p>
<p>The counterpart of neural network in the political system may sound<br />
familiar: The voters are divided into groups (states) and each group<br />
chooses its candidate based on the majority vote. Then some weighted<br />
majority of the votes of the states is taken to be the elected president.</p>
<p>The mathematical theorems imply that this system is much more sensitive to<br />
minor mistakes.</p>
<p>If the overwhelming majority of the population is voting for the same<br />
candidate then it doesn’t really matter which voting scheme we use. All of<br />
the natural schemes are “stable”. On the other hand, when the population<br />
is almost evenly split, different schemes behave differently.</p>
<p>The mathematical reasoning behind the stability of the majority vote goes<br />
back to Abraham DeMoivre and Pierre-Simon Laplace (18th century). This<br />
reasoning implies, for example, that in a population of 98,221,798 votes,<br />
if there is a bias of 222,880 for one candidate, then this candidate will<br />
be chosen, even if for each voter there is a small chance that his or her<br />
vote is not counted or counted wrongly (the results of the last election<br />
as of 11/13/00). As long as mistakes for both sides are equally likely,<br />
the result will correctly reflect the bias in the public opinion.</p>
<p>Thus, in this presidential election while the gap between the two<br />
candidates is only 0.2% of the votes it is still large enough so that the<br />
outcome is immune even if a fairly large percent (10% for example) of the<br />
votes were counted mistakenly (assuming the mistakes were random and<br />
independent.)</p>
<p>On the other hand the gap of a 388 votes among the 6,000,000 million votes<br />
in Florida (about 0.05% of the votes) may well be too small to overcome<br />
the effect of random mistakes in counting the votes, even if the chance<br />
for a mistake is fairly small (1%, say). It can well be argued that just<br />
because of the (unavoidable) mistakes in counting the votes in Florida<br />
(putting aside all other controversies surrounding the vote there) we will<br />
never be able to know who got the majority of votes among the voters of<br />
Florida. To understand why the picture is so different as far as the<br />
popular vote is concerns in the entire nation and the popular vote in the<br />
state of Florida we should note that the stability against mistakes<br />
increases dramatically as the number of voters rise. (And also, of course,<br />
as the gap between the candidates rise.)</p>
<p>The discrepancy between our ability to call the winner in the popular vote<br />
and disability to call the winner in the electoral college (which is the<br />
winner of the election according to the constitution) is not unexpected.</p>
<p>The new results by Benjamini, Schramm and Kalai show that for many models<br />
majority is the scheme which is least sensitive to noise. In these models<br />
it is assumed that voters make their decisions independently and the<br />
mistakes are symmetric and independent for different voters. It is shown<br />
then that for models resembling the current voting scheme in the U.S.A, if<br />
the population is almost evenly split, the scheme is much more sensitive<br />
to noise than the majority scheme. In particular a tiny fraction of<br />
mistakes is very likely to reverse the ideal outcome of the election.<br />
Moreover, if the elections are almost balanced, then the results are too<br />
close to call.</p>
<p>If the outcomes do not show significant bias towards one of the candidates<br />
then in the “popular-vote” method the probability of random independent<br />
mistakes which effect one in every A votes has a chance of one in the<br />
square-root of A to switch the outcome of the elections. In a method like<br />
the “electoral college” the chance is increased to something like one in<br />
the fourth root of A.</p>
<p>If the popular vote is significantly tilted towards one of the candidates<br />
than the effect of mistakes becomes smaller for all voting methods but<br />
much more so for the popular-vote method.</p>
<p>The study of the sensitivity of voting procedures to small errors for such<br />
models is based on mathematical tools from “harmonic analysis”, and<br />
provides a classification of the voting schemes which are very sensitive<br />
to small amounts of noise and those which are more stable. In particular<br />
among all symmetric voting procedures (i.e., all voters have the same<br />
power), the popular majority is the most robust.</p>
<p>For further technical reading and the precise formulation of the<br />
mathematical theorems see <a href="http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.PR/9811157" rel="nofollow">http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.PR/9811157</a></p>
<p>A word of warning is in place. The precise expected effect of mistakes<br />
will depend on the specific statistical model for the voting patterns and<br />
for the noise created by counting errors and biases. For example, more<br />
recent work by Claire Kanyon from Orsay university, Elchanan Mossel from<br />
Microsoft research and Yuval Peres from Berkeley and the Hebrew<br />
University, gives quite a different picture for different models based on<br />
the famous “Ising model” from Physics. We expect that the qualitative<br />
conclusion of the research by Benjamini, Kalai and Schramm applied to the<br />
case of U.S. presidential elections and that the popular vote method is<br />
much more stable to noise and biases than the electoral college method.<br />
For definite conclusions, however, some statistical work on actual voting<br />
data should be carried out. Choosing the most appropriate voting method<br />
involve, of course, many, primarily non-mathematical considerations.</p>

<div class="content">
A famous conjecture of Tuza states that the minimum number of edges needed to cover all the triangles in a graph is at most twice the maximum number of edge-disjoint triangles.  This conjecture was couched in a broader setting by Aharoni and Zerbib who proposed a hypergraph version of this conjecture, and also studied its implied fractional versions. We establish the fractional version of the Aharoni-Zerbib conjecture up to lower order terms. Specifically, we give a factor $t/2+ O(\sqrt{t \log t})$ approximation based on LP rounding for an algorithmic version of the hypergraph Tur\'{a}n problem (AHTP). The objective in AHTP is to pick the smallest collection of $(t-1)$-sized subsets of vertices of an input $t$-uniform hypergraph such that every hyperedge contains one of these subsets.

Aharoni and Zerbib also posed whether Tuza's conjecture and its hypergraph versions could follow from non-trivial duality gaps between vertex covers and matchings on hypergraphs that exclude certain sub-hypergraphs, for instance, a ``tent" structure that cannot occur in the incidence of triangles and edges. We give a strong negative answer to this question, by exhibiting tent-free hypergraphs, and indeed $\mathcal{F}$-free hypergraphs for any finite family $\mathcal{F}$ of excluded sub-hypergraphs, whose vertex covers must include almost all the vertices.


The algorithmic questions arising in the above study can be phrased as instances of vertex cover on \emph{simple} hypergraphs, whose hyperedges can pairwise share at most one vertex. We prove that the trivial factor $t$ approximation for vertex cover is hard to improve for simple $t$-uniform hypergraphs. However, for set cover on simple $n$-vertex hypergraphs, the greedy algorithm achieves a factor $(\ln n)/2$, better than the optimal $\ln n$ factor for general hypergraphs.</div>

<p>There are people who really, genuinely, believe, as far as you can dig down, that winning is everything—that however many lies they told, allies they betrayed, innocent lives they harmed, etc. etc., it was all justified by the fact that <strong>they won and their enemies lost</strong>.  Faced with such sociopaths, people like me typically feel an irresistible compulsion to <em>counterargue</em>: to make the sociopath realize that winning is <em>not</em> everything, that truth and honor are terminal values as well; to subject the sociopath to the standards by which the rest of us are judged; to find the conscience that the sociopath buried even from himself and drag it out into the light.  Let me know if you can think of any case in human history where such efforts succeeded, because I’m having difficulty doing so.</p>



<p>Clearly, in the vast majority of cases if not in all, the only counterargument that a sociopath will ever understand is <em>losing</em>.  And yet not just any kind of losing suffices.  For victims, there’s an <em>enormous</em> temptation to turn the sociopath’s underhanded tools against him, to win with the same deceit and naked power that the sociopath so gleefully inflicted on others.  And yet, if that’s what it takes to beat him, then you have to imagine the sociopath deriving a certain perverse satisfaction from it.</p>



<p>Think of the movie villain who, as the panting hero stands over him with his lightsaber, taunts “Yes … yes … destroy me!  Do it now!  Feel the hate and the rage flow through you!”  What happens next, of course, is that the hero angrily decides to give the villain one more chance, the ungrateful villain lunges to stab the hero in the back or something, and only then does the villain die—either by a self-inflicted accident, or else killed by the hero in immediate self-defense.  Either way, the hero walks away with victory <em>and</em> honor.</p>



<p>In practice, it’s a tall order to arrange all of that.  This explains why sociopaths are so hard to defeat, and why I feel so bleak and depressed whenever I see one flaunting his power.  But, you know, the great upside of pessimism is that it doesn’t take much to beat your expectations!  Whenever a single sociopath <em>is</em> cleanly and honorably defeated, or even just rendered irrelevant—no matter that the sociopath’s friends and allies are still in power, no matter that they’ll be back to fight another day, etc. etc.—it’s a genuine occasion for rejoicing.</p>



<p>Anyway, that pretty much sums up my thoughts regarding Arthur Chu.  In other news, hooray about the election!</p></div>

Valiant (1980) showed that general arithmetic circuits with negation can be exponentially more powerful than monotone ones. We give the first qualitative improvement to this classical result: we construct a  family of polynomials $P_n$ in $n$ variables, each of its monomials has positive coefficient, such that $P_n$ can be computed by a polynomial-size \emph{depth-three formula} but every monotone circuit computing it has size $2^{\Omega(n^{1/4}/\log(n))}$. 

The polynomial $P_n$ embeds the $\text{SINK}\circ \text{XOR}$ function devised recently by Chattopadhyay, Mande and Sherif (2020) to refute the Log-Approximate-Rank Conjecture in communication complexity. To prove our lower bound for $P_n$, we develop a general connection between corruption of combinatorial rectangles by  any function $f \circ \text{XOR}$ and corruption of product polynomials by a certain polynomial $P^f$ that is an arithmetic embedding of $f$. This connection should be of independent interest.

Using further ideas from communication complexity, we construct another family of set-multilinear polynomials $f_{n,m}$ such that both $F_{n,m} - \epsilon\cdot f_{n,m}$ and $F_{n,m} + \epsilon\cdot f_{n,m}$ have monotone circuit complexity $2^{\Omega(n/\log(n))}$ if $\epsilon \geq 2^{- \Omega( m )}$ and $F_{n,m} = \prod_{i=1}^n \big(x_{i,1} +\cdots+x_{i,m}\big)$, with $m = O( n/\log n )$. The polynomials $f_{n,m}$ have 0/1 coefficients and are in VNP. Proving such lower bounds for monotone circuits has been advocated recently by Hrubeš (2020) as a first step towards proving lower bounds against general circuits via his new approach.</div>

In this work, we initiate the study of proximity testing to Algebraic Geometry (AG) codes. An AG code $C = C(\mathcal C, \mathcal P, D)$ is a vector space associated to evaluations on $\mathcal P$ of functions in the Riemann-Roch space $L_\mathcal C(D)$. The problem of testing proximity to an error-correcting code $C$ consists in distinguishing between the case where an input word, given as an oracle, belongs to $C$ and the one where it is far from every codeword of $C$. AG codes are good candidates to construct \emph{short} proof systems, but there exists no efficient proximity tests for them. We aim to fill this gap.

We construct an Interactive Oracle Proof of Proximity (IOPP) for some families of AG codes by generalizing an IOPP for Reed-Solomon codes, known as the \textsf{FRI} protocol and introduced by Ben-Sasson, Bentov, Horesh and Riabzev in 2018. We identify suitable requirements for designing efficient IOPP systems for AG codes. In addition to proposing the first proximity test targeting AG codes, our IOPP admits quasilinear prover arithmetic complexity and sublinear verifier arithmetic complexity with constant soundness for meaningful classes of AG codes. We take advantage of the algebraic geometry framework that makes any group action on the curve that fixes the divisor $D$ translate into a decomposition of the code $C$. Concretely, our approach relies on Kani's result that splits the Riemann-Roch space of any invariant divisor under this action into several explicit Riemann-Roch spaces on the quotient curve. Under some hypotheses, these spaces behave well enough to define an AG code $C'$ on the quotient curve so that a proximity test to $C$ can be reduced to one to $C'$. Iterating this process thoroughly, we end up with a membership test to a code with significantly smaller length.</div>

A function $f(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ from a product domain $\mathcal{D}_1 \times \cdots \times \mathcal{D}_n$ to an abelian group $\mathcal{G}$ is a direct sum if it is of the form $f_1(x_1) + \cdots + f_n(x_n)$.  We present a new 4-query direct sum test with optimal (up to constant factors) soundness error.  This generalizes a result of Dinur and Golubev (RANDOM 2019) which is tailored to the target group $\mathcal{G} = \mathbb{Z}_2$.  As a special case, we obtain an optimal affinity test for $\mathcal{G}$-valued functions on domain $\{0, 1\}^n$ under product measure.  Our analysis relies on the hypercontractivity of the binary erasure channel.

We also study the testability of function partitionability over product domains into disjoint components. A $\mathcal{G}$-valued $f(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ is $k$-direct sum partitionable if it can be written as a sum of functions over $k$ nonempty disjoint sets of inputs.  A function $f(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ with unstructured product range $\mathcal{R}^k$ is  direct product partitionable if its outputs depend on disjoint sets of inputs.  

We show that direct sum partitionability and direct product partitionability are one-sided error testable with $O((n - k)(\log n + 1/\epsilon) + 1/\epsilon)$ adaptive queries and $O((n/\epsilon) \log^2(n/\epsilon))$ nonadaptive queries, respectively.  Both bounds are tight up to the logarithmic factors for constant $\epsilon$ even with respect to adaptive, two-sided error testers.  We also give a non-adaptive one-sided error tester for direct sum partitionability with query complexity $O(kn^2 (\log n)^2 / \epsilon)$.</div>

<p><br /></p><p>1) Biden will be the oldest president (measuring by when they take the oath of office), at 78. The next two are Trump 70 and Reagan 69. Biden will be older entering office then Reagan was leaving office. </p><p>After Biden, Trump, Reagan:</p><p>William Henry Harrison 68. Why do some people have middle names that are commonly spoken and some do not? Others with middle names spoken: Lee Harvey Oswald, John Wilkes Booth. </p><p>James Buchanan 65</p><p>George H. W. Bush 64. Why do some people have their initials commonly spoken and others do not? In this case it may be to distinguish from W. Why are some people known by their middle initial? Well, actually one that I know of, W.</p><p>Youngest was Theodore Roosevelt 42 who took the office after McKinley was assassinated . Kennedy was youngest to take the oath after being ELECTED at 43. Theodore Roosevelt was known as TR. John F Kennedy is often called JFK. Franklin D Roosevelt was called FDR. Why are some people known by their initials? In these cases maybe to distinguish them from other Roosevelts and Kennedys.</p><p>2) Right now it looks like GA will go for Biden. This surprises me. I had heard `GA is on the verge of turning blue and always will be.'</p><p>3) Dem-Blue, Rep-Red always puzzled me since I thought Red was associated with communism.</p><p>4) A quote from the Trump/Schwartz  book THE ART OF THE DEAL about why Carter was a one-termer  is rather predictive:</p><p>See <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/drudge-trump-election-con/">here</a></p><p>(I've heard Schwartz referred to as a ghost writer. That is not true-- Tony Schwartz's name is ON THE COVER, so he is not a ghostwriter.)</p><p>5) During the Trump administration UAE, Bahrain, and Sudan all recognized Israel (gee, when I see it on a map I recognize it, why did it take them so long :-) ). See <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-bahrain-israel-united-arab-emirates-sudan-07fe32a9ac1bd3afe5c503d4ff6bc859">here</a>. All three deals were brokered by the US so Trump could  take credit here. So why didn't he? One answer is that the left-wing lame stream media didn't cover it much. But FOX didn't cover it much. Trump didn't mention it much. Trump didn't even mention it as a way to complain about media coverage. So- independent of if you think Trump deserves credit here or not, I am interested in why he didn't brag about this one. (When I have asked this question people point out that Trump's base would not care about this. But Trump could complain that Obama got a Nobel Peace prize for nothing, and he got these deals done and hasn't, gotten a Nobel Prize because of the fake-Nobel-Committee and channel this into anti-Obama sentiment.)(ADDED LATER- some of the comments have corrected me and say that Trump DOES mention it-- A LOT. My bad. Still do not know if Fox News mentioned it much.) (ADDED LATER- another comment on my blog pointed to three times Fox News DID talk about this achievement.)</p><p>6) Truth avoids imitating  art: Watch Season five of the HBO show VEEP for how m</p><p>messy a close election can be. </p><p>7) I think Biden will end up being president and the transition will be peaceful. Why? Fox News and other conservative organizations are urging Trump to concede. Republican state legislators are NOT trying to find ways to overturn the results in their states. Judges have found NO evidence for the kinds of fraud that Trump is complaining about. Many Republicans are silent (John Oliver says that means they SUPPORT  Trumps allegations, but I think it means they are NOT supporting Trump's allegations.) </p><p> Why is the Republican establishment NOT backing Trumps claims of fraud? Here are some thoughts.</p><p>a) Because the allegations of fraud are not just false but obviously false.  </p><p>b) Because they think that it is better for the country to have a clean transition.</p><p>c) Because they are tired of Trump also and realize he is not good for the party brand (a bit late now).</p><p>d) Corrupting the electoral process is a bridge to far. (Where did that phrase come from?)</p><p>e) I wonder if Trump himself would have preferred to lose in 2016 and go around having rallies, perhaps have his own TV network. RALLIES are fun, RUNNING THE COUNTRY is not. So those around him may want him to go back to his original plan. </p><p>8) Did Nate (the only pollster with a one-word-name) do well this time around  He thinks so, see <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/nate-silver-tells-fivethirtyeight-critics-fuck-you-we-did-a-good-job">here</a>. Its not even clear he did badly in 2016- he gave Trump a 20% chance in 2016 and a 10% chance this time. </p><p>9) I think that if  we had not had a pandemic then  Trump would have won. Two reasons: the country thinks he handled it badly, and it may have literally killed some of his voters.  As a final note on that: Mark Meadows (WH Chief of staff) has COVID. I am surprised Pence didn't get it-- thought maybe he did or will. </p><p>10) Why did people in the Trump WH who one assumes know that Covid is serious and that masks and social distancing were  way to prevent it, not do these simple things?  Perhaps they thought (correctly) that the more people thing about covid, the more likely Trump loses, so they took a risk. Alas, those that trade their health for electability get neither. </p><p>11) Neither Pence nor Harris is particularly young or old as VP's go. </p><p>Youngest: John Breckenridge, 36. Buchanan's VP</p><p>Second Youngest: Richard Nixon, 40, Eisenhower's VP</p><p>Oldest: Alben Barkley, 71, Truman's VP</p><p>Second oldest: Charles Curtis, 69, Hoover's VP</p><p>Pence was 57 when took the oath, Harris will be 56. </p><p>12) If Biden wins then on Jan 20 when he takes the oath there will be 5 living Ex-presidents:Carter, Clinton, W, Obama, Trump (assuming they all stay alive until then). This ties the record for most living ex-presidents. See <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2018/12/george-hw-bush-passed-away-some-non.html">here</a> for my blog post on this. Getting to 6 will be difficult since Carter is 96 years old. </p><p>13) Neither Lance nor I have blogged much about the election, or even about politics. One reason is that whatever I want to say Scott says better (Scott and Lance are the only theory bloggers known by just their first names). I was going to point to Scott's  political blogs but that was hard since he often has blog posts about multiple topics (Like his post about  Mike Pence thinking that the Ind of CH is a sort of relativism that also allows for adultery to be considered okay (see <a href="https://archive.thinkprogress.org/mike-pence-argued-for-criminalization-of-adultery-before-joining-trump-ticket-e27e8a423caa/">here</a> for Pence's pre-Trump views on adultery)  Actually Scott never blogged about Pence and CH  but after reading his posts they kind of blur in my mind.) I will point to one blog entry of his  that I suspect will NOT be relevant but is still very interesting: <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4845">Will he go?</a></p><p>14) Trump claimed the polls showing he was behind were false and part of a conspiracy. I am not sure how this conspiracy would work. If people think their candidate is ahead or behind, then does that affect how or if they vote? Do people say `Gee X is winning, I'll vote for them' ? I doubt it. There are two ways such a conspiracy could work (1)  claim was that some candidate was WAY ahead (it would not matter which one) so you should not bother to vote (2)   in a primary where you are voting on who you think will win the general election.  He also claimed that the early returns saying Biden was winning was a conspiracy. Same problem there- how would that work. This isn't just Trump, other politicians in diff  years claim that early-returns saying X is winning might make it harder for Y to win. I can't see how. </p><p>15) Kamala Harris will be the first women, the first African-American, and the first Asian Veep.  Trivia: There has been a Native American Veep- who was it? More trivia- who coined the term <i>Veep? </i>I won't answer these here, but they might be on my Prez Quiz that I will post after the new President is sworn in.  </p><p>Can she be BOTH the first African-American and the first Asian? Yes.</p><p>16) In my lifetime the election for President was  SETTLED when the losing candidate conceded. This was good for the country's mindset that YES the president is known and even the other candidate agrees. What if Trump does not concede? I doubt this has any practical affect, except that  on Jan 20 he might be trying to arrange a moving van at the last minute. But if the losing candidate does not concede then when is the matter settled?  When the major news venues say it is? Which ones are major? What if there was a really close election and diff news networks declared diff candidates to have won? This does not seem to be a problem for this election cycle, but it is a question: When is the matter SETTLED in that the country ACCEPTS the result, if the losing candidate does not concede?</p><p>17) Carter beat incumbent Ford, but they became friends. Clinton beat incumbent Bush Sr, but they became friends. This is understandable in that so few people are president so they have a shared experience. I doubt that Trump and Biden will become friends.</p><p>18)   Bill Clinton's staff removed W's from the typewriters and did some other damage before W moved into the WH see <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/12/us/white-house-vandalized-in-transition-gao-finds.html">here</a>.  This is NOT a tradition, nor is it acceptable in any way, shape. or form.  I do not know of any other similar cases in America (if you do, let me know in the comments).  I wonder if Trump will do damage  to the WH before he leaves. Do presidents put a deposit down on the WH so that any damage they do, they pay for? I  doubt it, but it would be a good idea. </p><p>19)  Obama and Trump had a cordial 90 minute meeting, see <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/us/politics/white-house-transition-obama-trump.html">here</a>, after Trump won but before he moved in. This makes perfect sense--outgoing presidents know stuff and have experiences worth sharing with the next president.   Obama said North Korea would be a problem and it is (Trump later tried to spin this--`Obama said it would be hard, but it was easy') I wonder if Trump and Biden will have any kind of meeting, cordial or not. </p><p>20) Every state that went for H Clinton in 2016 went for Biden in 2020. The following states went for Trump in 2016 but went for Biden in 2020: Wisc, Mich, PA, AZ, and maybe Georgia and maybe NC (frankly I doubt NC). There was a plausible  scenario (I forget what it was) where Biden would have won 270-268. </p><p>21) Did Third parties matter? In PA the Libertarian Candidate Jo Jorgenson got 1.1% of the vote which was larger than the diff between Biden (49.7) and Trump (49.1) (The Green party either wasn't on the ballot or got so few votes it was not counted). If most of the Libertarians voted for Trump then he would have won PA and possibly the election. However, Trump is not really a Libertarian, so I doubt that would have happened As for the entire country: (1) . The Libertarians got 1.14% of the total vote in 2020, as opposed to 3.25% in 2016, (2)  The Green party got 1.06% in 2016 and 0.02% in 2020. </p><p>21) I was not particular impressed with the satires of the debates and other political satire on SNL this year. Not sure why- maybe Trump is too wild  to satirize and Joltin Jo is too boring. But the following I DID like and is now more relevant. Watch the whole thing since the first half looks like a real ad.</p><p><a href="https://deadline.com/2020/10/snl-cast-members-2020-trump-1234603033/">here</a><br /></p></div>

In this work we ask the following basic question:  assume the vertices of an expander graph are labelled by $0,1$. What "test" functions $f : \{ 0,1\}^t \to \{0,1\}$ cannot  distinguish  $t$ independent samples from those obtained by a random walk? The expander hitting property due to Ajtai, Komlos and Szemeredi (STOC 1987) is captured by the $\mathrm{AND}$ test function, whereas the fundamental expander Chernoff bound due to Gillman (SICOMP 1998), Heally (Computational Complexity 2008) is about test functions indicating whether the weight is close to the mean. In fact, it is known that all threshold functions are fooled by a random walk (Kipnis and Varadhan, Communications in Mathematical Physics 1986).  Recently, it was shown that even the highly sensitive $\mathrm{PARITY}$ function is fooled by a random walk (Ta-Shma; STOC 2017).  

We focus on balanced labels. Our first main result is proving that all symmetric functions are fooled by a random walk. Put differently, we prove a central limit theorem (CLT) for expander random walks with respect to the total variation distance, significantly strengthening the classic CLT for Markov Chains that is established with respect to the Kolmogorov distance due to Kipnis and Varadhan. Our approach significantly deviates from prior works. We first study how well a Fourier character $\chi_S$ is fooled by a random walk as a function of $S$. Then, given a test function $f$, we expand $f$ in the Fourier basis and combine the above with known results on the Fourier spectrum of $f$. 

We also proceed further and consider general test functions - not necessarily symmetric. As our approach is Fourier analytic, it is general enough to analyze  such versatile test functions. For our second result, we prove that random walks on sufficiently good expander graphs fool tests functions computed by $\mathbf{AC}^0$ circuits, read-once branching programs, and functions with bounded query complexity.</div>
