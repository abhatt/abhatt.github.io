<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from 
<a class="entryheader" href="https://scottaaronson.blog" title="Shtetl-Optimized">Scott Aaronson</a>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>Several people have complained that <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> has become too focused on the niche topic of “people being mean to Scott Aaronson on the Internet.”  In one sense, this criticism is deeply unfair—did I <em>decide</em> that a shockingly motivated and sophisticated troll should attack me all week, in many cases impersonating fellow academics to do so?  Has such a thing happened to <em>you</em>?  Did I <em>choose</em> a personality that forces me to respond when it happens?</p>



<p>In another sense, the criticism is of course completely, 100% justified.  That’s why I’m happy and grateful to have formed the <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6576">SOCG (Shtetl-Optimized Committee of Guardians)</a>, whose purpose is to prevent a recurrence, thereby letting me get back to your regularly scheduled programming.</p>



<p>On that note, I hope the complainers will be satisfied with more exclusive-to-<em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> content from one of the world’s greatest living public intellectuals: the Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology at Harvard University, Steven Pinker.</p>



<p>Last month, you’ll recall, Steve and I <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6524">debated the implications of scaling AI models</a> such as GPT-3 and DALL-E.  A main crux of disagreement turned out to be whether there’s any coherent concept of “superintelligence.”  I gave a qualified “yes” (I can’t provide <em>necessary and sufficient conditions</em> for it, nor do I know <em>when</em> AI will achieve it if ever, but there are certainly things an AI could do that would cause me to say it <em>was</em> achieved).  Steve, by contrast, gave a strong “no.”</p>



<p>My friend (and previous <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> guest blogger) Sarah Constantin then wrote a <a href="https://sarahconstantin.substack.com/p/is-human-intelligence-simple-part-75c">thoughtful response to Steve</a>, taking a different tack than I had.  Sarah emphasized that Steve himself is on record defending the statistical validity of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)">Spearman’s <em>g</em></a>: the “general factor of human intelligence,” which accounts for a large fraction of the variation in humans’ performance across nearly every intelligence test ever devised, and which is <em>also</em> found to correlate with cortical thickness and other physiological traits.  Is it so unreasonable, then, to suppose that <em>g</em> is measuring <em>something</em> of abstract significance, such that it would continue to make sense when extrapolated, not to godlike infinity, but at any rate, well beyond the maximum that happens to have been seen in humans?</p>



<p>I relayed Sarah’s question to Steve.  (As it happens, the same question was also discussed at length in, e.g., <a href="https://www.vetta.org/documents/Machine_Super_Intelligence.pdf">Shane Legg’s 2008 PhD thesis</a>; Legg then went on to cofound <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind">DeepMind</a>.)  Steve was then gracious enough to write the following answer, and to give me permission to post it here.  I’ll also share my reply to him.  There’s some further back-and-forth between me and Steve that I’ll save for the comments section to kick things off there.  Everyone is warmly welcomed to join: just remember to stay on topic, be respectful, and <strong>click the link in the verification email!</strong></p>

<h2>Comments on General, Artificial, and Super-Intelligence</h2>



<p><em>by Steven Pinker</em></p>



<p>While I defend the existence and utility of IQ and its principal component, general intelligence or <em>g</em>,  in the study of individual differences, I think it’s completely irrelevant to AI, AI scaling, and AI safety. It’s a measure of differences among humans within the restricted range they occupy, developed more than a century ago. It’s a statistical construct with no theoretical foundation, and it has tenuous connections to any mechanistic understanding of cognition other than as an omnibus measure of processing efficiency (speed of neural transmission, amount of neural tissue, and so on). It exists as a coherent variable only because performance scores on subtests like vocabulary, digit string memorization, and factual knowledge intercorrelate, yielding a statistical principal component, probably a global measure of neural fitness.</p>



<p>In that regard, it’s like a <em>Consumer Reports </em>global rating of cars, or overall score in the pentathlon. It would not be surprising that a car with a more powerful engine also had a better suspension and sound system, or that better swimmers are also, on average, better fencers and shooters. But this tells us precisely nothing about how engines or human bodies work. And imagining an extrapolation to a supervehicle or a superathlete is an exercise in fantasy but not a means to develop new technologies.</p>



<p>Indeed, if “superintelligence” consists of sky-high IQ scores, it’s been here since the 1970s! A few lines of code could recall digit strings or match digits to symbols orders of magnitude better than any human, and old-fashioned AI programs could also trounce us in multiple-choice vocabulary tests, geometric shape extrapolation (“progressive matrices”), analogies, and other IQ test components. None of this will help drive autonomous vehicles, discover cures for cancer, and so on.</p>



<p>As for recent breakthroughs in AI which may or may not surpass humans (the original prompt for this exchange); What is the IQ of GPT-3, or DALL-E, or AlphaGo? The question makes no sense!</p>



<p>So, to answer your question: yes, general intelligence in the psychometrician’s sense is not something that can be usefully extrapolated. And it’s “one-dimensional” only in the sense that a single statistical principal component can always be extracted from a set of intercorrelated variables.</p>



<p>One more point relevant to the general drift of the comments. My statement that “superintelligence” is incoherent is not a semantic quibble that the word is meaningless, and it’s not a pre-emptive strategy of Moving the True Scottish Goalposts. Sure, you could <em>define</em> “superintelligence,” just as you can define “miracle” or “perpetual motion machine” or “square circle.” And you could even recognize it if you ever saw it. But that does not make it coherent in the sense of being physically realizable.</p>



<p>If you’ll forgive me one more analogy, I think “superintelligence” is like “superpower.” Anyone can define “superpower” as “flight, superhuman strength, X-ray vision, heat vision, cold breath, super-speed, enhance hearing, and nigh-invulnerability.” Anyone could imagine it, and recognize it when he or she sees it. But that does not mean that there exists a highly advanced physiology called “superpower” that is possessed by refugees from Krypton!  It does not mean that anabolic steroids, because they increase speed and strength, can be “scaled” to yield superpowers. And a skeptic who makes these points is not quibbling over the meaning of the word <em>superpower, </em>nor would he or she balk at applying the word upon meeting a real-life Superman. Their point is that we almost certainly will never, in fact, meet a real-life Superman. That’s because he’s defined by human imagination, not by an understanding of how things work. We will, of course, encounter machines that are faster than humans, and that see X-rays, that fly, and so on, each exploiting the relevant technology, but “superpower” would be an utterly useless way of understanding them.</p>



<p>To bring it back to productive discussions of AI: there’s plenty of room to analyze the capabilities and limitations of particular intelligent algorithms and data structures—search, pattern-matching, error back-propagation, scripts, multilayer perceptrons, structure-mapping, hidden Markov models, and so on. But melting all these mechanisms into a global variable called “intelligence,” understanding it via turn-of-the-20<sup>th</sup>-century school tests, and mentally extrapolating it with a comic-book prefix, is, in my view, not a productive way of dealing with the challenges of AI.</p>

<h2>Scott’s Response</h2>



<p>I wanted to drill down on the following passage:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Sure, you could define “superintelligence,” just as you can define “miracle” or “perpetual motion machine” or “square circle.” And you could even recognize it if you ever saw it.  But that does not make it coherent in the sense of being physically realizable.</p></blockquote>



<p>The way I use the word “coherent,” it basically <em>means</em> “we could recognize it if we saw it.”  Clearly, then, there’s a sharp difference between this and “physically realizable,” although any physically-realizable empirical behavior must be coherent.  Thus, “miracle” and “perpetual motion machine” are both coherent but presumably not physically realizable.  “Square circle,” by contrast, is not even coherent.</p>



<p>You now seem to be saying that “superintelligence,” like “miracle” or “perpetuum mobile,” is coherent (in the “we could recognize it if we saw it” sense) but not physically realizable.  If so, then that’s a big departure from what I understood you to be saying before!  I thought you were saying that we couldn’t even recognize it.</p>



<p>If you do agree that there’s a quality that we could recognize as “superintelligence” if we saw it—and I don’t mean mere memory or calculation speed, but, let’s say, “the quality of being to John von Neumann in understanding and insight as von Neumann was to an average person”—and if the debate is merely over the physical realizability of that, then the arena shifts back to human evolution.  As you know far better than me, the human brain was limited in scale by the width of the birth canal, the need to be mobile, and severe limitations on energy.  And it wasn’t optimized for understanding algebraic number theory or anything else with no survival value in the ancestral environment.  So why should we think it’s gotten anywhere near the limits of what’s physically realizable in our world?</p>



<p>Not only does the concept of “superpowers” seem coherent to me, but from the perspective of someone a few centuries ago, we arguably <em>have</em> superpowers—the ability to summon any of several billion people onto a handheld video screen at a moment’s notice, etc. etc.  You’d probably reply that AI should be thought of the same way: just more tools that will enhance our capabilities, like airplanes or smartphones, not some terrifying science-fiction fantasy.</p>



<p>What I keep saying is this: we have the luxury of regarding airplanes and smartphones as “mere tools” <em>only</em> because there remain so many clear examples of tasks we can do that our devices can’t.  What happens when the devices can do <em>everything</em> important that we can do, much better than we can?  Provided we’re physicalists, I don’t see how we reject such a scenario as “not physically realizable.”  So then, are you making an empirical prediction that this scenario, although both coherent and physically realizable, won’t come to pass for thousands of years?  Are you saying that it might come to pass much sooner, like maybe this century, but even if so we shouldn’t worry, since a tool that can do everything important better than we can do it is still just a tool?</p></div>

A folklore conjecture in quantum computing is that the acceptance probability of a quantum query algorithm can be approximated by a classical decision tree, with only a polynomial increase in the number of queries. Motivated by this conjecture, Aaronson and Ambainis (Theory of Computing, 2014) conjectured that this should hold more generally for any bounded function computed by a low degree polynomial.

In this work we prove two new results towards establishing this conjecture: first, that any such polynomial has a small fractional certificate complexity; and second, that many inputs have a small sensitive block. We also give two new conjectures that, if true, would imply the Aaronson and Ambainis conjecture given our results. 

On the technical side, many classical techniques used in the analysis of Boolean functions seem to fail when applied to bounded functions. Here, we develop a new technique, based on a mix of combinatorics, analysis and geometry, and which in part extends a recent technique of Knop et al. (STOC 2021) to bounded functions.</div>

We say that two given polynomials $f, g \in R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, over a ring $R$, are equivalent under shifts if there exists a vector $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)\in R^n$ such that $f(x_1+a_1, \ldots, x_n+a_n) = g(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$. This is a special variant of the polynomial projection problem in Algebraic Complexity Theory.  Grigoriev and Karpinski (FOCS 1990), Lakshman and Saunders (SIAM J. Computing, 1995), and Grigoriev and Lakshman (ISSAC 1995) studied the problem of testing polynomial equivalence of a given polynomial to "any" $t$-sparse polynomial, over the rational numbers, and gave exponential time algorithms. In this paper, we provide  hardness results for this problem.
  
Formally, for a ring $R$, let $\mathrm{SparseShift}_R$ be the following decision problem -- Given a polynomial $P(X)$, is there a vector $a$ such that $P(X+a)$ contains fewer monomials than $P(X)$. We show that $\mathrm{SparseShift}_R$ is at least as hard as checking if a given system of polynomial equations over $R[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$ has a solution (Hilbert's Nullstellensatz).  

As a consequence of this reduction, we get the following results.
1. $\mathrm{SparseShift}_\mathbb{Z}$ is undecidable.
2. For any ring $R$ (which is not a field) such that $\mathrm{HN}_R$ is $\mathrm{NP}_R$-complete over the Blum-Shub-Smale model of computation, $\mathrm{SparseShift}_{R}$ is also $\mathrm{NP}_{R}$-complete.  In particular, $\mathrm{SparseShift}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ is also $\mathrm{NP}_{\mathbb{Z}}$-complete.


We also study the gap version of the $\mathrm{SparseShift}_R$ and show the following.  
1. For every function $\beta:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}_+$ such that $\beta\in o(1)$, $N^\beta$-gap-$\mathrm{SparseShift}_\mathbb{Z}$ is also undecidable (where $N$ is the input length).
2. For $R=\mathbb{F}_p, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{Z}_q$ and for every $\beta&gt;1$  the $\beta$-gap-$\mathrm{SparseShift}_R$ problem is $\mathrm{NP}$-hard. Furthermore, there exists a constant $\alpha&gt;1$ such that for every $d = O(1)$ in the sparse representation model, and for every $d\leq n^{O(1)}$ in the arithmetic circuit model, the $\alpha^d$-gap-$\mathrm{SparseShift}_R$  problem is  $\mathrm{NP}$-hard when given polynomials of degree at most $d$, in $O(nd)$ many variables, as input.</div>

<p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/B=auml=rtschi:Andreas.html">Andreas Bärtschi</a>, Stephan Eidenbenz <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09998">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>We present short-depth circuits to deterministically prepare any Dicke state
|Dn,k&gt;, which is the equal-amplitude superposition of all n-qubit computational
basis states with Hamming Weight k. Dicke states are an important class of
entangled quantum states with a large variety of applications, and a long
history of experimental creation in physical systems. On the other hand, not
much is known regarding efficient scalable quantum circuits for Dicke state
preparation on realistic quantum computing hardware connectivities.
</p>
<p>Here we present preparation circuits for Dicke states |Dn,k&gt; with (i) a depth
of O(k log(n/k)) for All-to-All connectivity (such as on current ion trap
devices); (ii) a depth of O(k sqrt(n/k)) = O(sqrt(nk) for Grid connectivity on
grids of size Omega(sqrt(n/s)) x O(sqrt(ns)) with s&lt;=k (such as on current
superconducting qubit devices).
</p>
<p>Both approaches have a total gate count of O(kn), need no ancilla qubits, and
generalize to both the preparation and compression of symmetric pure states in
which all non-zero amplitudes correspond to states with Hamming weight at most
k. Thus our work significantly improves and expands previous state-of-the art
circuits which had depth O(n) on a Linear Nearest Neighbor connectivity for
arbitrary k (Fundamentals of Computation Theory 2019) and depth O(log n) on
All-to-All connectivity for k=1 (Advanced Quantum Technologies 2019).

independence numbers of the subgraphs induced by its bags. The
tree-independence number of a graph is the minimum independence number of a
tree decomposition of it. Several NP-hard graph problems, like maximum weight
independent set, can be solved in time $n^{O(k)}$ if the input graph is given
with a tree decomposition of independence number at most $k$. However, it was
an open problem if tree-independence number could be computed or approximated
in $n^{f(k)}$ time, for some function $f$, and in particular it was not known
if maximum weight independent set could be solved in polynomial time on graphs
of bounded tree-independence number.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we resolve the main open problems about the computation of
tree-independence number. First, we give an algorithm that given an $n$-vertex
graph $G$ and an integer $k$, in time $2^{O(k^2)} n^{O(k)}$ either outputs a
tree decomposition of $G$ with independence number at most $8k$, or determines
that the tree-independence number of $G$ is larger than $k$. This implies
$2^{O(k^2)} n^{O(k)}$ time algorithms for various problems, like maximum weight
independent set, parameterized by tree-independence number $k$ without needing
the decomposition as an input. Then, we show that the exact computing of
tree-independence number is para-NP-hard, in particular, that for every
constant $k \ge 4$ it is NP-hard to decide if a given graph has
tree-independence number at most $k$.

algorithm solving the problem was described by Mulmuley et al. Despite a lot of
effort, it is still not known today whether a deterministic polynomial-time
algorithm exists. This makes the exact matching problem an important candidate
to test the popular conjecture that the complexity classes P and RP are equal.
In a recent article, progress was made towards this goal by showing that for
(bipartite) graphs of bounded (bipartite) independence number, a polynomial
time algorithm exists. In terms of parameterized complexity, this algorithm was
an XP-algorithm parameterized by the independence number. In this article, we
improve the techniques to obtain an FPT-algorithm for bipartite graphs. If the
input is a general graph we show that one can at least compute a perfect
matching $M$ which has the correct number of red edges modulo 2. This is
motivated by our last result, in which we prove that an FPT algorithm for
general graphs reduces to the problem of finding in polynomial time a perfect
matching $M$ with the correct number of red edges modulo 2 and additionally at
most $k$ red edges.

<p><b>Authors: </b>Dongliang Cao, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Bernard:Florian.html">Florian Bernard</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09610">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>3D shape matching is a long-standing problem in computer vision and computer
graphics. While deep neural networks were shown to lead to state-of-the-art
results in shape matching, existing learning-based approaches are limited in
the context of multi-shape matching: (i) either they focus on matching pairs of
shapes only and thus suffer from cycle-inconsistent multi-matchings, or (ii)
they require an explicit template shape to address the matching of a collection
of shapes. In this paper, we present a novel approach for deep multi-shape
matching that ensures cycle-consistent multi-matchings while not depending on
an explicit template shape. To this end, we utilise a shape-to-universe
multi-matching representation that we combine with powerful functional map
regularisation, so that our multi-shape matching neural network can be trained
in a fully unsupervised manner. While the functional map regularisation is only
considered during training time, functional maps are not computed for
predicting correspondences, thereby allowing for fast inference. We demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several challenging
benchmark datasets, and, most remarkably, that our unsupervised method even
outperforms recent supervised methods.

<p><b>Authors: </b>Dimitri Bertsekas <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09588">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>We consider some classical optimization problems in path planning and network
transport, and we introduce new auction-based algorithms for their optimal and
suboptimal solution. The algorithms are based on mathematical ideas that are
related to competitive bidding by persons for objects and the attendant market
equilibrium, which underlie auction processes. However, the starting point of
our algorithms is different, namely weighted and unweighted path construction
in directed graphs, rather than assignment of persons to objects. The new
algorithms have several potential advantages over existing methods: they are
empirically faster in some important contexts, such as max-flow, they are
well-suited for on-line replanning, and they can be adapted to distributed
asynchronous operation. Moreover, they allow arbitrary initial prices, without
complementary slackness restrictions, and thus are better-suited to take
advantage of reinforcement learning methods that use off-line training with
data, as well as on-line training during real-time operation. The new
algorithms may also find use in reinforcement learning contexts involving
approximation, such as multistep lookahead and tree search schemes, and/or
rollout algorithms.

sequential search with inspection costs, and gave an elegant index-based policy
that attains provably optimal expected payoff. In various scenarios, the
searching agent may select an option without making a costly inspection. Doval
(2018) studied a version of Pandora's problem that allows this, and showed that
the index-based policy and various other simple policies are no longer optimal.
Beyhaghi and Kleinberg (2019) gave the first non-trivial approximation

least a $(1 - \frac 1 e)$-fraction that of the optimal policy. No hardness
result for the problem was known.

Pandora's problem with nonobligatory inspection. We also give a polynomial-time

<p>Thanks so much to everyone who offered help and support as this blog’s comment section endured the weirdest, most motivated and sophisticated troll attack in its 17-year history.  For a week, a parade of self-assured commenters showed up to demand that I explain and defend my personal hygiene, private thoughts, sexual preferences, and behavior around female students (and, absurdly, to cajole me into taking my family on a specific Disney cruise ship).  In many cases, the troll or trolls <em>appropriated the names and email addresses of real academics</em>, imitating them so convincingly that those academics’ closest colleagues told me they were confident it was really them.  And when some trolls finally “outed” themselves, I had no way to know whether that was just another chapter in the trolling campaign.  It was enough to precipitate an epistemic crisis, where one actively doubts the authenticity of just about <em>every</em> piece of text.</p>



<p>The irony isn’t lost on me that I’ve endured this just as I’m <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6484">starting my year-long gig at OpenAI</a>, to think, among other things, about the potential avenues for misuse of Large Language Models like GPT-3, and what theoretical computer science could contribute to mitigating them.  To say this episode has given me a more vivid understanding of the risks would be an understatement.</p>



<p><strong><em>But why didn’t I just block and ignore the trolls immediately?  Why did I bother engaging?</em></strong>  </p>



<p>At least a hundred people asked some variant of this question, and the answer is this.  For most of my professional life, this blog has been my forum, where anyone in the world could show up to raise any issue they wanted, as if we were tunic-wearing philosophers in the Athenian agora.  I prided myself on my refusal to take the coward’s way out and ignore anything—even, <em>especially</em>, severe personal criticism.  I’d witnessed how Jon Stewart, let’s say, would night after night completely eviscerate George W. Bush, his policies and worldview and way of speaking and justifications and lies, and then Bush would just continue the next day, totally oblivious, never deigning to rebut any of it.  And it became a core part of my identity that I’d never be like that.  If anyone on earth had a narrative of me where I was an arrogant bigot, a clueless idiot, etc., I’d confront that narrative head-on and refute it—or if I couldn’t, I’d reinvent my whole life.  What I’d <em>never</em> do is suffer anyone’s monstrous caricature of me to strut around the Internet unchallenged, as if conceding that only my academic prestige or tenure or power, rather than a reasoned rebuttal, could protect me from the harsh truths that the caricature revealed.</p>



<p>Over the years, of course, I carved out some exceptions: P=NP provers and quantum mechanics deniers enraged that I’d dismissed their world-changing insights.  Raving antisemites.  <em>Their</em> caricatures of me had no legs in any community I cared about.  But if an attack carried the implied backing of the whole modern social-justice movement, of thousands of angry grad students on Twitter, of <em>Slate</em> and <em>Salon</em> and <em>New York Times</em> writers and Wikipedia editors and university DEI offices, then the coward’s way out was closed.  The monstrous caricature then loomed directly over me; I could either parry his attacks or die.</p>



<p>With this stance, you might say, the astounding part is not that this blog’s “agora” model eventually broke down, but rather that it survived for so long!  I started blogging in October 2005.  It took until July 2022 for me to endure a full-scale “social/emotional denial of service attack” (not counting the comment-171 affair).  Now that I have, though, it’s obvious even to me that the old way is no longer tenable.</p>



<p>So what’s the solution?  Some of you liked the idea of requiring registration with real email addresses—but alas, when I tried to implement that, I found that WordPress’s registration system is a mess and I couldn’t see how to make it work.  Others liked the idea of moving to Substack, but others actively hated it, and in any case, even if I moved, I’d <em>still</em> have to figure out a comment policy!  Still others liked the idea of an army of volunteer moderators.  At least ten people volunteered themselves.</p>



<p>On reflection, the following strikes me as most directly addressing the actual problem.  I’m hereby establishing the <strong>Shtetl-Optimized Committee of Guardians</strong>, or SOCG (same acronym as the <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/socg21/socg.html">computational geometry conference</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt="🙂" /> ).  If you’re interested in joining, shoot me an email, or leave a comment on this post with your (real!) email address.  I’ll accept members only if I know them in real life, personally or by reputation, or if they have an honorable history on this blog.</p>



<p>For now, the SOCG’s only job is this: whenever I get a comment that gives me a feeling of unease—because, e.g., it seems trollish or nasty or insincere, it asks a too-personal question, or it challenges me to rebut a hostile caricature of myself—I’ll email the comment to the SOCG and ask what to do.  I precommit to respecting the verdict of those SOCG members who respond, whenever a clear verdict exists.  The verdict could be, e.g., “this seems fine,” “if you won’t be able to resist responding then don’t let this appear,” or “email the commenter first to confirm their identity.”  And if I simply need reassurance that the commenter’s view of me is false, I’ll seek it from the SOCG before I seek it from the whole world.</p>



<p>Here’s what SOCG members can expect in return: I continue pouring my heart into this subscription-free, ad-free blog, and I credit you for making it possible—publicly if you’re comfortable with your name being listed, privately if not.  I buy you a fancy lunch or dinner if we’re ever in the same town.</p>



<p>Eventually, we might move to a model where the SOCG members can log in to WordPress and directly moderate comments themselves.  But let’s try it this way first and see if it works.</p></div>

We study the query complexity of one-sided $\epsilon$-testing the class of Boolean functions $f:F^n\to \{0,1\}$ that describe affine subspaces and Boolean functions that describe axis-parallel affine subspaces, where $F$ is any finite field. We give a polynomial-time $\epsilon$-testers that ask $\tilde O(1/\epsilon)$ queries. This improves the query complexity $\tilde O(|F|/\epsilon)$ in~[16]. 

We then show that any one-sided $\epsilon$-tester with proximity parameter $\epsilon&lt;1/|F|^d$ for the class of Boolean functions that describe $(n-d)$-dimensional affine subspaces and Boolean functions that describe axis-parallel $(n-d)$-dimensional affine subspaces must make at least
$\Omega(1/\epsilon+|F|^{d-1}\log n)$ and $\Omega(1/\epsilon+|F|^{d-1}n)$ queries, respectively.
This improves the lower bound $\Omega(\log n/\log\log n)$  that is proved in~[16] for $F=GF(2)$. We also give  testers for those classes with query complexity that almost match the lower bounds.</div>

Karen Donde is the Chair of <a href="https://complexityexhibition.org/">Complexity 2022</a>, which is being held this month in Knoxville, Tennessee. This is not the same as the <a href="https://computationalcomplexity.org/Archive/2022/fullsite/">Computational Complexity 2022</a> (CCC22) conference, which is being held <b>in-person</b> at the University of Pennsylvania this <b>Wednesday, July 20</b>, through <b>Saturday, July 23</b>. The Knoxville event is not about computer science, nor dynamical nor biological complexity. It is about the art of weaving complex patterns in textiles by hand.</p>
<p>
Today we collect pointers to the papers at CCC22 after saying something separate about weaving and proofs.</p>
<p>
Unlike CCC22, the Knoxville exhibition is also <a href="https://complexityexhibition.org/all-works/">open online</a>. Here is a detail from the Complex Weaver first prize <a href="https://complexityexhibition.org/melanie-olde-morphology-i/">winner</a>, an example of three-dimensional weaving:</p>

<p>
Like CCC22, the Knoxville event has a program committee.

<p></p><p>
Karen Donde also writes a <a href="https://karen63615.wixsite.com/karendondeblog">blog</a>, <em>Speaking of Weaving</em>. The blog has numerous technical how-to articles. In some places they verge on mathematical theory. </p>
<p>
There are more express connections between mathematics and weaving. The mathematics teacher <a href="http://www.patrickhonner.com/about.html">Patrick Honner</a> has a <a href="https://mrhonner.com/weaving">page</a> of posts on weaving. He was featured in an <a href="https://naturalmath.com/2012/07/weaving-mathematics/">article</a> “Weaving your way through mathematics” by the mathematics educator Maria Droujkova. See also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Breul3cnW9s">video</a> on weaving and the mathematics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph">Spirograph</a> patterns.</p>
<p>
On the computing theory side, connections to cellular automata are shown in a 2017 <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Complexity-of-Braids,-Cables,-and-Weaves-with-Holden/5b83e108623548c8b073a1e96b00d027eefb197e">paper</a> by Joshua Holden. There is also a recent <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3411764.3445750">paper</a> from CMU’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute on “Enabling Personal Computational Handweaving with a Low-Cost Jacquard Loom.” </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Weaving Into Proofs </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Our association to weaving was really motivated, however, by an <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-do-mathematicians-know-their-proofs-are-correct-20220713/">article</a> last Wednesday by Steven Strogatz, a Cornell mathematician and extraordinary popularizer whom I (Ken) have known since we were undergraduates together at Princeton. The article interviews the Harvard mathematician Melanie Matchett Wood and is titled, “How Do Mathematicians Know Their Proofs Are Correct?”</p>
<p>
We have written about proofs and the social issue of verification <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/06/13/sorting-and-proving/">several</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/23/hilberts-lost-problem/">times</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2020/12/10/the-future-of-mathematics/">recently</a>. But this article goes into a more particular topic that we tried to get at in a <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2014/09/09/a-challenge-from-dyson/">series</a> of <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2014/06/06/is-this-a-proof-2/">posts</a> in <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2014/10/11/more-on-testing-dysons-conjecture/">2014</a>. This is about whether probabilistic modeling—not the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_method">Probabilistic Method</a> which is airtight—can give confidence in conjectures that is tantamount to proof.</p>
<p>
Strogatz’s interview leads off with a reference to a 2019 <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/where-proof-evidence-and-imagination-intersect-in-math-20190314/">article</a> for <em>Quanta</em> titled, “Where Proof, Evidence, and Imagination Intersect.” That article is by the same Patrick Honner whom we just mentioned for weaving, and gives caveats of how bias and unrecognized implicit constraints can creep into models, so as to invalidate them. </p>
<p>
Wood begins with basic “coinflip” random models of primes—such as mentioned in the above-listed posts—and fixes on a bias-revealing model that we also covered <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2016/03/26/bias-in-the-primes/">here</a>. She then describes how they incrementally build rules for adjusting coin weights to compensate for biases introduced by small-number cases: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “So the model is something that starts with this coin-flipping model, but then it’s modified by all these other rules, and all the other things that we know about the primes. And once you put all of those things that we do know into the model, you then ask [it] well, do you see, infinitely often, coins coming up prime just 2 apart? And the model tells you, oh, yes, we do see that. In fact, we see it at this very particular rate we can give you a formula for. And then … you see that the model gives you a very accurate prediction for the number of pairs of twin primes you’ll find as you go along. And so then you think, you know, maybe this model knows what it’s talking about.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
In response to Strogatz noting that the accuracy must be judged by long computer runs, Wood is quick to emphasize that the rules given to the model are determined manually:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “But for building this model and coming up with the formula that the model gives. You know, that’s done by hand, essentially, by mathematicians thinking about the model and figuring out with it. … [A]t some point, the computer stops. You know, there’s only so much computing power. But that formula that you would get, that the model would give you, that you could prove is true, again, about this model coin-flipping situation, that formula will keep going. You can put bigger and bigger numbers into that formula, much bigger than your computer could ever, ever compute with.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Proof of the Loom? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Wood goes on to describe <em>universality</em> in probability theory as signifying “that there are certain kinds of machines that if you put in a lot of random inputs, you can predict the output.” She gives as a bellwether example how the Central Limit Theorem creates such a universal machine for the bell curve. Regardless of an unknown distribution <em>D</em>, if you take means of samples from <em>D</em>, then the bell curve gives progressively—and provably—more accurate predictions of your outputs. Strogatz catches the warp and asks whether “somehow we’re getting the idea of universality to show up in number theory? Or am I dreaming?” Her peroration is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “[W]hat my collaborators and I work on is trying to make that kind of dream a reality so that, that some of these puzzling questions about numbers that we don’t know the answer to, maybe we could understand that there are patterns that come out, like a bell curve, like a normal distribution, that we can prove came out of the machine even if we don’t know what mysteries were put in.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
So she is building a machine that takes rules as input—like Jacquard cards for a loom—and produces patterns that are analyzable. We use the computational success of the machine to judge how well universality has taken hold—as theoretically it must—and generate proofs from formulas based on the <em>a-priori</em> predicted outputs using the rules input thus far. </p>
<p>
This is like building a loom for weaving proofs—where, however, there is still the question of confidence in how well the patterns obtained match reality. Such doubt notwithstanding, the process may also augment non-linear ways of evaluating claimed proofs of the kind we discussed <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2020/06/13/proof-checking-not-line-by-line/">here</a> and recently debated <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/04/10/discussion-about-proving-again/">here</a>.</p>

<div class="content">
A Chor--Goldreich (CG) source [CG88] is a sequence of random variables  $X = X_1 \circ \ldots \circ X_t$, each $X_i \sim \{0,1 \{^d$, such that each $X_i$ has $\delta d$ min-entropy for some constant $\delta &gt; 0$, even conditioned on any fixing of $X_1 \circ \ldots \circ X_{i-1}$. We typically think of $d$ as constant. We extend this notion in several ways, and most notably allow each $X_i$ to be only $\gamma$-close to having $\delta d$ min entropy.

Studying such almost CG sources allows us to achieve pseudorandomness results which were not known to hold even for standard CG sources, and even for the weaker model of Santha--Vazirani sources [SV86]. We construct a deterministic condenser that on input $X$, outputs a distribution which is close to having constant entropy gap, namely a distribution $Z \sim \{0,1 \}^m$ for $m \approx \delta dt$ with min-entropy $m-O(1)$. 

Our new primitive readily implies fast simulation results:

*	We can simulate $\mathbf{BPP}$ using almost CG sources with constant multiplicative slowdown.
*	When the randomized algorithm has small failure probability, we can simulate it using almost CG sources with no multiplicative slowdown. This result extends to randomized protocols as well, and any setting in which we cannot simply cycle over all seeds, and a ``one-shot'' simulation is needed.

Moreover, our framework is flexible enough to work even when the $X_i$-s only have Shannon entropy rather than min-entropy, and in some cases, even when a few $X_i$-s are completely damaged.

Our main technical contribution is a novel analysis of random walks which may be of independent interest. We analyze walks with adversarially correlated steps, each step being entropy-deficient, on good enough lossless expanders. We prove that such walks (or certain interleaved walks on two expanders), starting from a fixed vertex and walking according to $X_1\circ \ldots \circ X_t$, accumulate most of the entropy in $X$.</div>

<p>The ability of large neural networks to generalize is commonly believed to stem from an implicit regularization — a tendency of gradient-based optimization towards predictors of low complexity.
A lot of effort has gone into theoretically formalizing this intuition.
Tackling modern neural networks head-on can be quite difficult, so existing analyses often focus on simplified models as stepping stones.
Among these, matrix and tensor factorizations have attracted significant attention due to their correspondence to linear neural networks and certain shallow non-linear convolutional networks, respectively. 
Specifically, they were shown to exhibit an implicit tendency towards low matrix and tensor ranks, respectively.</p>

<p>This post overviews a recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11729">ICML 2022 paper</a> with <a href="https://asafmaman101.github.io/">Asaf Maman</a> and <a href="http://www.cohennadav.com/">Nadav Cohen</a>, in which we draw closer to practical deep learning by analyzing <em>hierarchical tensor factorization</em>, a model equivalent to certain <em>deep non-linear</em> convolutional networks. 
We find that, analogously to matrix and tensor factorizations, the implicit regularization in hierarchical tensor factorization strives to lower a notion of rank (called hierarchical tensor rank).
This turns out to have surprising implications on the origin of locality in convolutional networks, inspiring a practical method (explicit regularization scheme) for improving their performance on tasks with long-range dependencies.</p>

<h2 id="background-matrix-and-tensor-factorizations">Background: Matrix and Tensor Factorizations</h2>

<p>To put our work into context, let us briefly go over existing dynamical characterizations of implicit regularization in matrix and tensor factorizations.
In both cases they suggest an incremental learning process that leads to low rank solutions (for respective notions of rank). We will then see how these characterizations transfer to the considerably richer hierarchical tensor factorization.</p>

<h3 id="matrix-factorization-incremental-matrix-rank-learning">Matrix factorization: Incremental matrix rank learning</h3>
<p><em>Matrix factorization</em> is arguably the most extensively studied model in the context of implicit regularization. 
Indeed, it was already discussed in four previous posts (<a href="https://www.offconvex.org/2021/07/08/imp-reg-tf/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.offconvex.org/2020/11/27/reg_dl_not_norm/">2</a>, <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2019/07/10/trajectories-linear-nets/">3</a>, <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2019/06/03/trajectories/">4</a>), but for completeness we will present it once more. 
Consider the task of minimizing a loss $\mathcal{L}_M : \mathbb{R}^{D, D’} \to \mathbb{R}$ over matrices, e.g. $\mathcal{L}_M$ can be a matrix completion loss — mean squared error over observed entries from some ground truth matrix. 
Matrix factorization refers to parameterizing the solution $W_M \in \mathbb{R}^{D, D’}$ as a product of $L$ matrices, and minimizing the resulting objective using <em>gradient descent (GD)</em>:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
\[
    \min\nolimits_{W^{(1)}, \ldots, W^{(L)}} \mathcal{L}_M \big ( W_M \big ) := \mathcal{L}_M \big ( W^{(1)} \cdots W^{(L)} \big ) ~.
\]
</div>
<p>Essentially, matrix factorization amounts to applying a linear neural network (fully connected neural network with no non-linearity) for minimizing $\mathcal{L}_M$. 
We can explicitly constrain the matrix rank of $W_M$ by limiting the shared dimensions of the weight matrices $\{ W^{(l)} \}_l$. However, from an implicit regularization standpoint, the most interesting case is where rank is unconstrained. 
In this case there is no explicit regularization, and the kind of solution we get is determined implicitly by the parameterization and the optimization algorithm.</p>

<p>Although it was initially conjectured that GD (with small initialization and step size) over matrix factorization minimizes a norm (see the seminal work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09280">Gunasekar et al. 2017</a>), recent evidence points towards an implicit matrix rank minimization (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13655">Arora et al. 2019</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.13262">Gidel et al. 2019</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06398">Razin &amp; Cohen 2020</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13772">Chou et al. 2020</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09839">Li et al. 2021</a>).
In particular, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13655">Arora et al. 2019</a> characterized the dynamics of $W_M$’s singular values throughout optimization:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem (informal; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13655">Arora et al. 2019</a>):</strong>
Gradient flow (GD with infinitesimal step size) over matrix factorization initialized near zero leads the $r$’th singular value of $W_M$, denoted $\sigma_M^{(r)} (t)$, to evolve by:
[ 
    \color{brown}{\frac{d}{dt} \sigma_M^{(r)} (t) \propto \sigma_M^{(r)} (t)^{2 - 2/L}} ~.
]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As can be seen from the theorem above, singular values evolve at a rate proportional to their size exponentiated by $2 - 2 / L$. This means that they are subject to a momentum-like effect, by which they move slower when small and faster when large. 
When initializing near the origin (as commonly done in practice), we therefore expect singular values to progress slowly at first, and then, upon reaching a certain threshold, to quickly rise until convergence. 
<strong>These dynamics create an incremental learning process that promotes solutions with few large singular values and many small ones, i.e. low matrix rank solutions</strong>.
In their paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13655">Arora et al. 2019</a> support this qualitative explanation through theoretical illustrations and empirical evaluations. 
For example, the following plot reproduces one of their experiments:</p>

<p><br />
We note that the incremental matrix rank learning phenomenon was later on used to prove exact matrix rank minimization, under certain technical conditions (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09839">Li et al. 2021</a>).</p>

<h3 id="tensor-factorization-incremental-tensor-rank-learning">Tensor factorization: Incremental tensor rank learning</h3>

<p>Despite the significant interest in matrix factorization, as a theoretical surrogate for deep learning its practical relevance is rather limited. 
It corresponds to linear neural networks, and thus misses non-linearity — a crucial aspect of modern neural networks.
As was mentioned in a <a href="https://www.offconvex.org/2021/07/08/imp-reg-tf/">previous post</a>, by moving from matrix (two-dimensional array) to tensor (multi-dimensional array) factorizations it is possible to address this limitation.</p>

<p>A classical scheme for factorizing tensors, named CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP), parameterizes a tensor as a sum of outer products (for more details on this scheme, see <a href="http://www.kolda.net/publication/TensorReview.pdf">this excellent survey</a>).
Given a loss $\mathcal{L}_T : \mathbb{R}^{D_1, \ldots, D_N} \to \mathbb{R}$ over $N$-dimensional tensors, e.g. $\mathcal{L}_T$ can be a tensor completion loss, we simply refer by <em>tensor factorization</em> to parameterizing the solution $\mathcal{W}_T \in \mathbb{R}^{D_1, \ldots, D_N}$ as a CP factorization, and minimizing the resulting objective via GD:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
\[
    \min\nolimits_{ \{ \mathbf{w}_r^n \}_{r , n} } \mathcal{L}_T \big ( \mathcal{W}_T \big ) := \mathcal{L}_T \big (  {\textstyle \sum}_{r = 1}^R \mathbf{w}_r^1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{w}_r^N \big) ~.
\]
</div>
<p>Each term $\mathbf{w}_r^{(1)} \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{w}_r^{(N)}$ in the sum is called a <em>component</em>, and $\otimes$ stands for outer product.
The concept of rank naturally extends from matrices to tensors.
For a given tensor $\mathcal{W}$, its <em>tensor rank</em> is defined to be the minimal number of components (i.e. of outer product summands) $R$ required for CP parameterization to express it.
Note that we can explicitly constrain the tensor rank of $\mathcal{W}_T$ by limiting the number of components $R$.
But, since our interest lies in implicit regularization, we consider the case where $R$ is large enough for any tensor to be expressed.</p>

<p>Similarly to how matrix factorization captures linear neural networks, tensor factorization is equivalent to certain <em>shallow non-linear</em> convolutional networks (with multiplicative non-linearity).
This equivalence was discussed in a couple of previous posts (<a href="https://www.offconvex.org/2020/11/27/reg_dl_not_norm/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.offconvex.org/2021/07/08/imp-reg-tf/">2</a>), for the exact details behind it feel free to check out the preliminaries section of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11729">our paper</a> and references therein.
The bottom line is that tensor factorization takes us one step closer to practical neural networks.</p>

<p>Motivated by the incremental learning dynamics in matrix factorization, in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09972">previous paper</a> (see accompanying <a href="https://www.offconvex.org/2021/07/08/imp-reg-tf/">blog post</a>) we analyzed the behavior of component norms during optimization of tensor factorization:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem (informal; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09972">Razin et al. 2021</a>):</strong>
Gradient flow over tensor factorization initialized near zero leads the $r$’th component norm, $\sigma_T^{(r)} (t) := || \mathbf{w}_r^1 (t) \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{w}_r^N (t) ||$, to evolve by:
[ 
    \color{brown}{\frac{d}{dt} \sigma_T^{(r)} (t) \propto \sigma_T^{(r)} (t)^{2 - 2/N}} ~.
]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The dynamics of component norms in tensor factorization are structurally identical to those of singular values in matrix factorization.
Accordingly, we get a momentum-like effect that attenuates the movement of small component norms and accelerates that of large ones.
This suggests that, <strong>in analogy with matrix factorization, when initializing near zero components tend to be learned incrementally, resulting in a bias towards low tensor rank</strong>.
The following plot empirically demonstrates this phenomenon:</p>

<br />

<p><br />
Continuing with the analogy to matrix factorization, the incremental tensor rank learning phenomenon formed the basis for proving exact tensor rank minimization, under certain technical conditions (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09972">Razin et al. 2021</a>).</p>

<h2 id="hierarchical-tensor-factorization">Hierarchical Tensor Factorization</h2>

<p>Tensor factorization took us beyond linear predictors, yet it still lacks a critical feature of modern neural networks — depth (recall that it corresponds to <em>shallow</em> non-linear convolutional networks).
A natural extension that accounts for both non-linearity and depth is <em>hierarchical tensor factorization</em> — our protagonist — which corresponds to certain <em>deep</em> non-linear convolutional networks (with multiplicative non-linearity).
This equivalence is actually not new, and has facilitated numerous analyses of expressive power in deep learning (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02302">this survey</a> for a high-level overview).</p>

<p>As opposed to tensor factorization, which is a simple construct dating back to at least the early 20’th century (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sapm192761164">Hitchcock 1927</a>), hierarchical tensor factorization was formally introduced only recently (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00041-009-9094-9">Hackbusch &amp; Kuhn 2009</a>), and is much more elaborate.
Its exact definition is rather technical (the interested reader can find it in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11729">our paper</a>).
For our current purpose it suffices to know that a hierarchical tensor factorization consists of multiple local tensor factorizations, whose components we call the <em>local components</em> of the hierarchical factorization.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/imp_reg_htf/tf_htf_cnn_blog.png" style="width: 900px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 10px;" />
<br />
<i><b>Figure 3:</b> 
Tensor factorization, which is a sum of components (outer products), <br /> corresponds to a shallow non-linear convolutional neural network (CNN).
<br /> Hierarchical tensor factorization, which consists of multiple local tensor <br /> factorizations, corresponds to a deep non-linear CNN.
</i>
</div>
<p><br />
In contrast to matrices, which have a single standard definition for rank, tensors posses several different definitions for rank.
Hierarchical tensor factorizations induce their own such notion, known as <em>hierarchical tensor rank</em>.
Basically, if a tensor can be represented through hierarchical tensor factorization with few local components, then it has low hierarchical tensor rank.
This stands in direct analogy with tensor rank, which is low if the tensor can be represented through tensor factorization with few components.</p>

<p>Seeing that the implicit regularization in matrix and tensor factorizations leads to low matrix and tensor ranks, respectively, in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11729">our paper</a> we investigated whether the implicit regularization in hierarchical tensor factorization leads to low hierarchical tensor rank. 
That is, whether GD (with small initialization and step size) over hierarchical tensor factorization learns solutions that can be represented with few local components.
Turns out it does.</p>

<h2 id="dynamical-analysis-incremental-hierarchical-tensor-rank-learning">Dynamical Analysis: Incremental Hierarchical Tensor Rank Learning</h2>

<p>At the heart of our analysis is the following dynamical characterization for local component norms during optimization of hierarchical tensor factorization:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem (informal):</strong>
Gradient flow over hierarchical tensor factorization initialized near zero leads the $r$’th local component norm in a local tensor factorization, denoted $\sigma_H^{(r)} (t)$, to evolve by:
[ 
    \color{brown}{\frac{d}{dt} \sigma_H^{(r)} (t) \propto \sigma_H^{(r)} (t)^{2 - 2/K}} ~,
]
where $K$ is the number of axes of the local tensor factorization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This should really feel like deja vu, as these <strong>dynamics are structurally identical to those of singular values in matrix factorization and component norms in tensor factorization!</strong>
Again, we have a momentum-like effect, by which local component norms move slower when small and faster when large.
As a result, <strong>when initializing near zero local components tend to be learned incrementally, yielding a bias towards low hierarchical tensor rank</strong>.
In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11729">the paper</a> we provide theoretical and empirical demonstrations of this phenomenon.
For example, the following plot shows the evolution of local component norms at some local tensor factorization under GD:</p>

<h2 id="practical-implication-countering-locality-in-convolutional-networks-via-explicit-regularization">Practical Implication: Countering Locality in Convolutional Networks via Explicit Regularization</h2>

<p>We saw that in hierarchical tensor factorization GD leads to solutions of low hierarchical tensor rank.
But what does this even mean for the associated convolutional networks?</p>

<p>Hierarchical tensor rank is known (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06743">Cohen &amp; Shashua 2017</a>) to measure the strength of long-range dependencies modeled by a network.
In the context of image classification, e.g., it quantifies how well we take into account dependencies between distant patches of pixels.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>The implicit regularization towards low hierarchical tensor rank in hierarchical tensor factorization therefore translates to an implicit regularization towards <em>locality</em> in the corresponding convolutional networks</strong>.
At first this may not seem surprising, since convolutional networks typically struggle or completely fail to learn tasks entailing long-range dependencies.
However, conventional wisdom attributes this failure to expressive properties (i.e. to an inability of convolutional networks to realize functions modeling long-range dependencies), suggesting that addressing the problem requires modifying the architecture.
Our analysis, on the other hand, reveals that implicit regularization also plays a role: it is not just a matter of expressive power, the optimization algorithm is implicitly pushing towards local solutions.
Inspired by this observation, we asked:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question:</strong>
Is it possible to improve the performance of modern convolutional networks on long-range tasks via explicit regularization (without modifying their architecture)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To explore this prospect, <strong>we designed explicit regularization that counteracts locality by promoting high hierarchical tensor rank (i.e. long-range dependencies)</strong>.
Then, through a series of controlled experiments, <strong>we confirmed that it can greatly improve the performance of modern convolutional networks (e.g. ResNets) on long-range tasks</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, the following plot displays test accuracies achieved by a ResNet on an image classification benchmark, in which it is possible to control the spatial range of dependencies required to model.
When increasing the range of dependencies, the test accuracy obtained by an unregularized network substantially deteriorates, reaching performance no better than random guessing.
As evident from the plot, our regularization closes the gap between short- and long-range tasks, significantly boosting generalization on the latter.</p>

<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding Thoughts</h2>
<p>Looking forward, there are two main takeaways from our work:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Across three different neural network types (equivalent to matrix, tensor, and hierarchical tensor factorizations), we have an architecture-dependant notion of rank that is implicitly lowered. Moreover, the underlying mechanism for this implicit regularization is identical in all cases. This leads us to believe that implicit regularization towards low rank may be a general phenomenon. If true, finding notions of rank lowered for different architectures can facilitate an understanding of generalization in deep learning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our findings imply that the tendency of modern convolutional networks towards locality may largely be due to implicit regularization, and not an inherent limitation of expressive power as often believed. More broadly, they showcase that deep learning architectures considered suboptimal for certain tasks can be greatly improved through a right choice of explicit regularization. 
Theoretical understanding of implicit regularization may be key to discovering such regularizers.</p>

In the range avoidance problem, the input is a multi-output Boolean circuit with more outputs than inputs, and the goal is to find a string outside its range (which is guaranteed to exist). We show that well-known explicit construction questions such as finding binary linear codes achieving the Gilbert-Varshamov bound or list-decoding capacity, and constructing rigid matrices, reduce to the range avoidance problem of log-depth circuits, and by a further recent reduction [Ren, Santhanam, and Wang, ECCC 2022] to $NC^0_4$ circuits where each output depends on at most $4$ input bits. 

On the algorithmic side, we show that range avoidance for $NC^0_2$ circuits can be solved in polynomial time. We identify a general condition relating to correlation with low-degree parities that implies that any almost pairwise independent set has some string that avoids the range of every circuit in the class. We apply this to $NC^0$ circuits, and to small width CNF/DNF and general De Morgan formulae (via a connection to approximate-degree), yielding non-trivial small hitting sets for range avoidance in these cases.</div>

A code $C \colon \{0,1\}^k \to \{0,1\}^n$ is a $q$-locally decodable code ($q$-LDC) if one can recover any chosen bit $b_i$ of the message $b \in \{0,1\}^k$ with good confidence by randomly querying the encoding $x = C(b)$ on at most $q$ coordinates. Existing constructions of $2$-LDCs achieve $n = \exp(O(k))$, and lower bounds show that this is in fact tight. However, when $q = 3$, far less is known: the best constructions achieve $n = \exp(k^{o(1)})$, while the best known results only show a quadratic lower bound $n \geq \widetilde{\Omega}(k^2)$ on the blocklength.

In this paper, we prove a near-cubic lower bound of $n \geq \widetilde{\Omega}(k^3)$ on the blocklength of $3$-query LDCs. This improves on the best known prior works by a polynomial factor in $k$. Our proof relies on a new connection between LDCs and refuting constraint satisfaction problems with limited randomness. Our quantitative improvement builds on the new techniques for refuting semirandom instances of CSPs developed in [GKM22] and, in particular, relies on bounding the $(\infty \to 1)$-norm of appropriate Kikuchi matrices.</div>

<div class="content">
We initiate a study of the streaming complexity of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) when the constraints arrive in a random order. We show that there exists a CSP, namely Max-DICUT, for which random ordering makes a provable difference. Whereas a $4/9 \approx 0.445$ approximation of DICUT requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ space with adversarial ordering, we show that with random ordering of constraints there exists a $0.48$-approximation algorithm that only needs $O(\log n)$ space. We also give new algorithms for Max-DICUT in variants of the adversarial ordering setting. Specifically, we give a two-pass  $O(\log n)$ space $0.48$-approximation algorithm for general graphs and a single-pass $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ space $0.48$-approximation algorithm for bounded degree graphs.
    
    On the negative side, we prove that CSPs where the satisfying assignments of the constraints support a one-wise independent distribution require $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$-space for any non-trivial approximation, even when the constraints are randomly ordered. This was previously known only for adversarially ordered constraints. Extending the results to randomly ordered constraints requires switching the hard instances from a union of random matchings to simple Erdos-Renyi random (hyper)graphs and extending tools that can perform Fourier analysis on such instances. 
    
    The only CSP to have been considered previously with random ordering is Max-CUT where the ordering is not known to change the approximability. Specifically, it is known to be as hard to approximate with random ordering as with adversarial ordering, for $o(\sqrt{n})$ space algorithms. Our results show a richer variety of possibilities and motivate further study of CSPs with randomly ordered constraints.</div>

<div class="content">
We study the polynomial equivalence problem for orbits of read-once arithmetic formulas (ROFs). Read-once formulas have received considerable attention in both algebraic and Boolean complexity and have served as a testbed for developing effective tools and techniques for analyzing circuits. Two $n$-variate polynomials $f, g \in \mathbb{F}[\mathbf{x}]$ are equivalent, denoted as $f \sim g$, if there is an $A \in \mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbb{F})$ such that $f = g(A\mathbf{x})$. The orbit of $f$ is the set of all polynomials equivalent to $f$. We investigate the complexity of the following two natural problems on ROFs:

1. Equivalence test for ROFs: Given black-box access to $f$, check if it is in the orbit of an ROF. If yes, output an ROF $C$ and an $A \in \mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbb{F})$ such that $f = C(A\mathbf{x})$.  
2. Polynomial equivalence for orbits of ROFs: Given black-box access to $f$ and $g$ in the orbits of two unknown ROFs, check if $f \sim g$. If yes, output an $A \in \mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbb{F})$ such that $f = g(A\mathbf{x})$.

These problems are significant generalizations of two well-studied problems in algebraic complexity, namely reconstruction of ROFs and quadratic form equivalence. In this work, we give the first randomized polynomial-time algorithms (with oracle access to quadratic form equivalence) to solve the two problems. The equivalence test works for general ROFs; it also implies an efficient learning algorithm for random arithmetic formulas of unbounded depth and fan-in (in the high number of variables setting). The algorithm for the second problem, which invokes the equivalence test, works for mildly restricted ROFs, namely additive-constant-free ROFs.  	
	
The equivalence test is based on a novel interplay between the factors and the essential variables of the Hessian determinant of an ROF, the essential variables of the ROF, and certain special structures in the ROF that we call "skewed paths". To our knowledge, the Hessian of a general ROF (or even a depth-4 ROF) has not been analyzed before. Analyzing the Hessian and combining the knowledge gained from it with the skewed paths to recursively discover formulas in the orbits of sub-ROFs of lower depth (without incurring an exponential blow-up due to unbounded depth) constitute the main technical contributions of this work.</div>

<p>This is a photo of my book shelf at the office. Ever since joining Harvard, I have been ordering copies of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-since-Democritus-Aaronson/dp/0521199565">Quantum Computing Since Democritus</a> on a regular basis. I often hand them out to bright students, curious about science, whom I want to expose to the beautiful connections between computer science, math, physics, and even philosophy. Scott has been one of the great popularizers of our field even before he started blogging in 2005. His surveys and blog posts provide some of the best introductions to our field. For example, when investigating  <a href="http://quant-ph/0502072">P vs NP and physical reality</a>, Scott actually <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=266">went out and verified</a> that nature indeed cannot solve an NP-complete problem via finding the globally minimal energy configuration of soap bubbles.  Through his blog, popular writing, and research, Scott has done more than anyone else to introduce new people of all backgrounds to theoretical computer science. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="543" alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JRN6bxodVkY1JiHSWOEx4QXtvmH3twDk-O5jGgsio1IM92aUUxYZ87i7T0qU8bfrCnVbBWIt1OV4soNgnhoMpTHvnJBIVk8tAPO_oK2_WLzHbrGfWNpRDQyazey-CG9V0YLDDZ2r45pwOKsSF4PZaQ" height="408" /></figure></div>


<p>One of Scott’s endearing qualities is his openness to all people. While many of us would ignore a random email or anonymous blog comment, Scott would patiently explain for the millionth time why quantum computers can’t solve NP-hard problems by “trying all solutions in parallel” or why Bell’s Inequality does indeed rule out hidden-variable theories of nature. Alas, the same openness also results in him sometimes giving too much attention and caring far too much about the opinions of Internet “trolls” that are not worthy of his time. </p>



<p>While Scott has always attracted some vitriol, recently this has taken to a <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6546">new level</a>, with commenters attacking his integrity, his speech mannerisms, even his T-shirt choice/frequency, and worst of all, his family, with misogynistic attacks on his wife and xenophobic and ableist attacks on neurodivergent researchers.</p>



<p>None of these people have made a fraction of the contributions of Scott not just to science, but also to broadening the diversity of computer science, and other causes including <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6411">assisting women dealing with Texas’ restrictive abortion laws</a>. (As full disclosure, one of the causes <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6256">Scott helped raise money</a> for is <a href="https://www.addiscoder.com/">AddisCoder</a> and <a href="https://jamcoder.org.jm/">JamCoders</a> of which I am a board member. I just came back from a <a href="https://twitter.com/boazbaraktcs/status/1545765613167067136?s=20&amp;t=53HLUIjmCwBsl1oYhEQXhw">week teaching in Jamaica</a>, the students were amazing and are so thankful for the chance to participate in this program; they couldn’t care less how often Scott changes his shirt.)</p>



<p>I am grateful that Scott is a member of our scientific community and proud to call him my friend. Does this mean that I agree with all his positions? Absolutely not. I tend to be on his left on many issues  (though am probably more conservative when it comes to oracle-based complexity..). Are there people he’s friendly with whom I even more strongly disagree with, and whose views I might even find repugnant? Probably. But it doesn’t matter, all of us are connected via 6 degrees of separation. If we start to “recursively cancel” every one that is somehow connected to someone we find odious, then we would not be able to talk to anyone.</p>



<p>I hope that Scott is not disheartened by these attacks, and continues to contribute for many years to CS research and education, outreach, and humanity at large.</p></div>

We give the first polynomial-time *non-adaptive* proper learning algorithm of Boolean sparse multivariate polynomial under the uniform distribution. Our algorithm, for $s$-sparse polynomial over $n$ variables, makes $q=(s/\epsilon)^{\gamma(s,\epsilon)}\log n$ queries where $2.66\le \gamma(s,\epsilon)\le 6.922$ and runs in $\tilde O(n)\cdot poly(s,1/\epsilon)$ time. We also show that for any $\epsilon=1/s^{O(1)}$ any non-adaptive learning algorithm must make at least $(s/\epsilon)^{\Omega(1)}\log n$ queries. Therefore, the query complexity of our algorithm is also polynomial in the optimal query complexity and optimal in $n$.</div>

<p><strong>Update (July 13):</strong> I was honored to read <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2022/07/13/my-friend-scott-aaronson/">this post</a> by my friend Boaz Barak.</p>



<p><strong>Update (July 14):</strong> By now, comments on this post allegedly from four CS professors  — namely, Josh Alman, Aloni Cohen, Rana Hanocka, and Anna Farzindar — as well as from the graduate student “BA,” <em>have been unmasked as from impersonator(s)</em>.</p>



<p>I’ve been the target of a motivated attack-troll (or multiple trolls, but I now believe just one) who knows about the CS community. This might be the single weirdest thing that’s happened to me in 17 years of blogging, surpassing even the legendary <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=277">Ricoh printer episode</a> of 2007.  It obviously underscores the need for a new, stricter comment policy, which is what this whole post was about.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Yesterday and today, both my work and my enjoyment of the James Webb images were interrupted by an anonymous troll, who used the <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> comment section to heap <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6546#comment-1941041">libelous abuse</a> on me—derailing an anodyne quantum computing discussion to opine at length about how I’m a disgusting creep who surely, probably, maybe has lewd thoughts about his female students.  Unwisely or not, I allowed it all to appear, and replied to all of it.  I had a few reasons: I wanted to prove that I’m now strong enough to withstand bullying that might once have driven me to suicide.  I wanted, frankly, many readers to come to my defense (thanks to those who did!).  I at least wanted readers to <em>see</em> firsthand what I now regularly deal with: the emotional price of maintaining this blog.  Most of all, I wanted my feminist, social-justice-supporting readers to either explicitly endorse or (hopefully) explicitly repudiate the unambiguous harassment that was now being gleefully committed in their name.</p>



<p>Then, though, the same commenter upped the ante further, by heaping misogynistic abuse on my wife <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~danama/">Dana</a>—while <em>still</em>, ludicrously and incongruously, cloaking themselves in the rhetoric of social justice.  Yes: apparently the woke, feminist thing to do is now to rate female computer scientists on their looks.</p>



<p>Let me be blunt: I cannot continue to write <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> while dealing with regular harassment of me and my family.  At the same time, I’m also determined not to “surrender to the terrorists.”  So, I’m weighing the following options:</p>



<ul><li>Close comments except to commenters who provide a real identity—e.g., a full real name, a matching email address, a website.</li><li>Move to Substack, and then allow only commenters who’ve signed up.</li><li>Hire someone to pre-screen comments for me, and delete ones that are abusive or harassing (to me or others) before I even see them.  (Any volunteers??)</li><li>Make the comment sections for readers only, eliminating any expectation that I’ll participate.</li></ul>



<p>One thing that’s clear is that the status quo will not continue.  I can’t “just delete” harassing or abusive comments, because the trolls have gotten too good at triggering me, and they will continue to weaponize my openness and my ethic of responding to all possible arguments against me.</p>



<p>So, regular readers: what do you prefer?</p></div>

<p> A while back I reviewed<i> A Map that Reflects the Territory</i> which is a collection of essays posted on the lesswrong forum. My review is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/bookrev/FRED/lesswrong.pdf">here</a>. I posted it to both this blog and to the lesswrong forum. In both cases I posted a link to it.

In our latest paper, we present a framework for pinpointing the impact of the source datasets in transfer learning. Our framework enables us to improve transfer learning performance by removing source datapoints that are detrimental for a specific target task. It also unlocks various other capabilities, such as debugging transfer learning failures, automatically identifying granular subpopulations in the target dataset, and detecting data leakage between source and target datasets. 
</i></p>

<p>Transfer learning is a widely utilized technique for adapting a model trained on a source dataset to improve performance on a downstream target task. Used in applications ranging from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06871">radiology</a>, <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017_workshops/w13/papers/Kim_End-To-End_Ego_Lane_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf">autonomous driving</a>, to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00098">satellite imagery analysis</a>, the transfer learning paradigm also fuels the recent emergence of large vision and language models trained on enormous amounts of data, such as <a href="https://openai.com/blog/clip/">CLIP</a> or <a href="https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/">GPT-3</a>.</p>

<p>Why is transfer learning so effective though? And, in particular, what drives transfer learning performance? Definitely, much depends on the properties of the source model, i.e., the model trained on the source dataset. For example, recent works highlight the impact of the model’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06871">architecture</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08974">accuracy</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08489">adversarial vulnerability</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05901">training procedure</a>.</p>

<p>But, in addition to the source model, it is hard to not expect the source dataset to play a major role as well. Indeed, several works have shown that increasing the size of the dataset usually <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11370">boosts transfer learning performance</a>. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07056">Others</a> have found that limiting the source dataset to images that are relevant to the target task can help as well. So: what is the exact role of the source dataset in transfer learning?</p>

<p>In our most <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05739">recent paper</a>, we present a framework for pinpointing the impact of the source dataset on the downstream predictions in transfer learning. This framework draws inspiration from techniques such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03703">influence functions</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00622">datamodels</a> and it enables us, in particular, to automatically identify source datapoints that—positively or negatively—impact transfer learning performance.</p>

<p>We’ll now walk through how we calculate the influence of the source dataset in transfer learning, and then demonstrate how our framework can be used to:</p>

<ul type="a">
  <li>Boost transfer learning performance by removing detrimental source datapoints;</li>
  <li>Automatically extract granular subpopulations in the target dataset by projecting the  class hierarchy of the source dataset onto it; and</li>
  <li>Surface pathologies such as source-target data leakage and misleading or mislabelled source datapoints.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="computing-the-influence-of-the-source-dataset">Computing the Influence of the Source Dataset</h2>

<p>How to pinpoint the relationship between the source dataset’s composition and the model’s downstream predictions? We build here on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03703">influence functions</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00622">datamodels</a> methodology (check out our <a href="https://gradientscience.org/datamodels-1/">previous post</a> for a deeper dive into these) to study the counterfactual effect of removing source datapoints on the target model’s predictions. However, unlike in the standard supervised setting in which the focus is on individual datapoints, here we focus on removing entire classes. This is motivated by the fact that we expect the removal of entire classes to have a more measurable impact on the features learned by the source model (and thus the resulting model’s predictions).</p>

<p>So, at a high level, we first train a large number of models on random subsets of classes in the source dataset, and fine-tune them on the target task. Then we compute the influence of a source class on a target example by simply measuring the average difference in the model’s performance on a given target example when the class was included versus excluded from the source dataset. A positive influence value thus means that including the class improved the model’s performance on that example, while a negative value indicates that the class was detrimental to the correctness of the corresponding model’s prediction.</p>

<h2 id="identifying-the-most-influential-classes-of-the-source-dataset">Identifying the Most Influential Classes of the Source Dataset</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve calculated these influences, how can we use them to study transfer learning? First, let’s take a look at the ranking of the most positively and negatively influencing classes for a variety of target tasks. We first look at the influences from different ImageNet classes to the entire CIFAR-10 test set:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/data-transfer/images/most_influencing_classes.png" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0;" alt="Most influential" />
</p>

<p>Note that in the most positive source classes tend to semantically overlap with the classes in the target dataset. For example, tailed frog and sorrel horse have the most positive influence for the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains the classes frog and horse.</p>

<p>Also, the plot above suggests that there is a number of source classes, such as bookshop or jigsaw puzzle, whose inclusion actually hurts the overall transfer learning performance. So what happens if we indeed remove these classes from the source dataset? Well, as one might hope, they do boost the transfer learning performance on a variety of downstream image classification:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/data-transfer/images/main_counterfactual_exp.png" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0;" alt="Counterfactual main" /></p>
<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p>In fact, we can get an accuracy boost of nearly 2.5% on CIFAR-10 (as compared to what one gets from pre-training with the full ImageNet dataset).</p>

<h2 id="leveraging-influences-to-study-transfer-learning">Leveraging Influences to Study Transfer Learning</h2>

<p>Above, we used our framework to pinpoint the most influential—be it positively or negatively— classes for transfer learning. Here, we’ll discuss how our framework provides us with a broader set of tools for studying transfer learning, including: (1) debugging transfer learning failures, (2) automatically extracting granular subpopulations in the target dataset, and (3) detecting data leakage between source and target datasets.</p>

<h3 id="1--debugging-the-failures-of-the-transferred-model">(1)  Debugging the failures of the transferred model</h3>
<p>Suppose our transferred model wrongly predicts the dog image displayed in the figure below—it labels it as a horse. Can we use our framework to understand why our model is making this mistake? Yes! The influences we computed enable us to identify the source class sorrel horse as one having a strong (and the strongest) negative influence on our image of interest. This suggests that the features learned by the source model due to the presence of this class might be the culprit here. Indeed, once we remove the sorrel horse class from the source dataset, our model now makes the correct prediction on our dog image much more frequently (with respect to the randomness of the training procedure).</p>

<div style="overflow: auto; text-align: center;" id="debug_examples_widget"></div>
<div class="footnote">
Identifying highly negatively influencing source classes can explain why our transfer learning model made a mistake (middle). Once we remove the most negatively influencing class from the source dataset, the model predicts the correct label more frequently (right). Click through the thumbnails on the left to see more examples!
</div>



<h3 id="2-automatically-extracting-granular-subpopulations-in-the-target-dataset">(2) Automatically extracting granular subpopulations in the target dataset</h3>
<p>Imagine you want to find all the images of ostriches in the CIFAR-10 dataset. However, the problem is that CIFAR-10 does not contain any subpopulation annotations that could help with this task and having to manually look for ostriches among all the images in the bird class is not a very appealing alternative. Our framework allows us to do something much more scalable!</p>

<p>Indeed, as we already observed, the most positively influencing source classes usually semantically overlap with the images in the target dataset they influence the most. In fact, this goes further: the target images which are most influenced by a given source class tend to share relevant salient features too. So, to identify our ostrich subpopulation in CIFAR-10, we just need to look at all the images that are most influenced by the source class “ostrich”! Below we display some of the CIFAR-10 images identified in this way.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<h3 id="3-detecting-data-leakage-and-misleading-source-dataset-examples">(3) Detecting data-leakage and misleading source dataset examples</h3>
<p>Thus far, we have focused on the role of classes in the source dataset in transfer learning. But we can also compute the influences of specific source examples on the transferred model’s predictions. This turns out to enable us to isolate, in particular, instances of data leakage and misleading examples in the source dataset.</p>

<p>Indeed, below, we display ImageNet training examples that are highly influential on CIFAR-10 test examples. The source images that have a highly positive influence are often identical copies of images from the target task (just at a higher resolution)—a clear example of data leakage. On the other hand, images that have a high negative influence tend to be the ones that are misleading, mislabeled, or otherwise surprising.  For example, the presence of the (amusing) ImageNet image of a flying lawnmower (see below) hurts the performance on a CIFAR-10 image of a regular (but similarly shaped) airplane.</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/data-transfer/images/detect_leakage.png" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0;" alt="Detect leakage" />
</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>In this post, we described a new framework for pinpointing the impact of the source dataset in transfer learning. Our framework allows one to improve the transfer learning performance on a range of downstream tasks by identifying and removing source datapoints that are detrimental. Furthermore, by using our framework one can automatically extract granular subpopulations in the target dataset by leveraging the fine-grained class hierarchy of the source dataset, better understand how the errors of the model on the downstream task are rooted in the source dataset, and detect potential data leakage from the source to the downstream dataset. We believe our framework provides a new perspective on transfer learning by highlighting the role of the source dataset in the transfer learning pipeline and gives us a toolkit for performing a fine-grained analysis of it.</p></div>

<p>(1) Fellow <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/">CS theory blogger</a> (and, 20 years ago, member of my PhD thesis committee) Luca Trevisan <a href="http://bulletin.eatcs.org/index.php/beatcs/article/download/701/733">interviews me about <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em></a>, for the <em>Bulletin of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science</em>.  Questions include: what motivates me to blog, who my main inspirations are, my favorite posts, whether blogging has influenced my actual research, and my thoughts on the role of public intellectuals in the age of social-media outrage.</p>



<p>(2) Anurag Anshu, Nikolas Breuckmann, and Chinmay Nirkhe have apparently <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13228">proved the NLTS (No Low-Energy Trivial States) Conjecture</a>!  This is considered a major step toward a proof of the famous <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7495?context=cs">Quantum PCP Conjecture</a>, which—speaking of one of Luca Trevisan’s questions—was <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=139">first publicly raised</a> right here on <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> back in 2006.</p>



<p>(3) The Microsoft team has finally <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02472">released its promised paper</a> about the detection of Majorana zero modes (“this time for real”), a major step along the way to creating topological qubits.  See also this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnYghkDaHH0&amp;t=3691s">live YouTube peer review</a>—is that a thing now?—by Vincent Mourik and Sergey Frolov, the latter having been instrumental in the retraction of Microsoft’s previous claim along these lines.  I’ll leave further discussion to people who actually understand the experiments.</p>



<p>(4) I’m looking forward to the <a href="https://computationalcomplexity.org/">2022 Conference on Computational Complexity</a> less than two weeks from now, in my … safe? clean? beautiful? awe-inspiring? … birth-city of Philadelphia.  There I’ll listen to a <a href="https://computationalcomplexity.org/Archive/2022/program.php">great lineup of talks</a>, including one by my PhD student William Kretschmer on his joint work with me and DeVon Ingram on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10409">The Acrobatics of BQP</a>, and to co-receive the CCC Best Paper Award (wow! thanks!) for that work.  I look forward to meeting some old and new <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers there.</p></div>

<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>In Steven Pinker’s <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6524">guest post from last week</a>, there’s one bit to which I never replied.  Steve wrote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>After all, in many areas Einstein was no Einstein. You [Scott] above all could speak of his not-so-superintelligence in quantum physics…</p></blockquote>



<p>While I can’t speak “above all,” OK, I can speak.  Now that we’re closing in on a century of quantum physics, can we <em>finally</em> adjudicate what Einstein and Bohr were right or wrong about in the 1920s and 1930s?  (Also, how is it still even a thing people argue about?)</p>



<p>The core is this: when confronted with the phenomena of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement">entanglement</a>—including the ability to measure one qubit of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_state">EPR pair</a> and thereby collapse the other in a basis of one’s choice (as we’d put it today), as well as the possibility of a whole pile of gunpowder in a coherent superposition of exploding and not exploding (Einstein’s example in a letter to Schrödinger, which the latter then infamously transformed into a cat)—well, there are entire conferences and edited volumes about what Bohr and Einstein said, didn’t say, meant to say or tried to say about these matters, but in cartoon form:</p>



<ul><li>Einstein said that quantum mechanics can’t be the final answer, it has ludicrous implications for reality if you actually take it seriously, the resolution must be that it’s just a statistical approximation to something deeper, and at any rate there’s clearly more to be said.</li><li>Bohr (translated from Ponderousness to English) said that quantum mechanics sure <em>looks like</em> a final answer and not an approximation to anything deeper, there’s not much more to be said, we don’t even <em>know</em> what the implications are for “reality” (if any) so we shouldn’t hyperventilate about it, and mostly we need to change the way we use words and think about our own role as observers.</li></ul>



<p>A century later, do we know anything about these questions that Einstein and Bohr didn’t?  Well, we now know the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem">Bell inequality</a>, the experiments that have demonstrated Bell inequality violation with increasing finality (most recently, in 2015, <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=2464">closing</a> both the detector and the locality loopholes), other constraints on hidden-variable theories (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochen%E2%80%93Specker_theorem">Kochen-Specker</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBR_theorem">PBR</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence">decoherence theory</a>, and the experiments that have <a href="https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/physicists-smash-record-for-wave-particle-duality-462c39db8e7b">manufactured</a> increasingly enormous superpositions (still, for better or worse, not exploding piles of gunpowder or cats!), while also verifying detailed predictions about how such superpositions decohere due to entanglement with the environment rather than some mysterious new law of physics.</p>



<p>So, if we were able to send a single short message back in time to the 1927 Solvay Conference, adjudicating between Einstein and Bohr without getting into any specifics, what should the message say?  Here’s my attempt:</p>



<ul><li>In 2022, quantum mechanics <em>does</em> still seem to be a final answer—not an approximation to anything deeper as Einstein hoped.  And yet, contra Bohr, there <em>was</em> considerably more to say about the matter!  The implications for reality could indeed be described as “ludicrous” from a classical perspective, arguably even <em>more</em> than Einstein realized.  And yet the resolution turns out simply to be that we live in a universe where those implications are true.</li></ul>



<p>OK, here’s the point I want to make.  Even supposing you agree with me (not everyone will) that the above would be a reasonable modern summary to send back in time, <em>it’s still totally unclear how to use it to mark the Einstein vs. Bohr scorecard!</em>  </p>



<p>Indeed, it’s not surprising that partisans have defended every possible scoring, from 100% for Bohr (quantum mechanics vindicated! Bohr called it from the start!), to 100% for Einstein (he put his finger directly on the implications that needed to be understood, against the evil Bohr who tried to shut everyone up about them!  Einstein FTW!).</p>



<p>Personally, I’d give <em>neither</em> of them perfect marks, in part because they not only both missed Bell’s Theorem, but failed even to ask the requisite question (namely: what empirically verifiable tasks can Alice and Bob <em>use entanglement to do</em>, that they couldn’t have done without entanglement?).  But I’d give both of them very high marks for, y’know, still being Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr.</p>



<p>And with that, I’m proud to have said the final word about precisely what Einstein and Bohr got right and wrong about quantum physics.  I’m relieved that no one will ever need to debate that tiresome historical question again … certainly not in the comments section of this post.</p></div>

<p>Suppose we want to train a classifier to distinguish between dogs and cats given a labeled dataset of photos. Having read about the perils of training on biased or otherwise suboptimal data, we comb through our collection of labeled images and carefully eliminate problems like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08818">spurious correlations</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02659">under-represented subgroups</a>. So, for example, finding that most cats in the dataset were photographed indoors while most dogs were photographed outdoors, we collect more outdoor cat photos and indoor dog photos.</p>

<p>The result is a carefully curated dataset that we can now use to train our classifier. Unfortunately, there is a problem: our dataset is small, so training on it yields a poorly performing model. But, fortunately, we know what to do! To get a better classifier, we go online and <a href="https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models">download</a> (or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/">pay for</a>) a pre-trained model, i.e., a model that’s been trained on a much larger dataset like <a href="https://image-net.org/index.php">ImageNet-1K</a> or <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/07/revisiting-unreasonable-effectiveness.html">JFT-300</a>. We’ll then use transfer learning to adapt this pre-trained model (the “source model”) to our dataset (the “target dataset”). Transfer learning from a pre-trained model in this way results in a model that performs much better on our target task than one trained on it from scratch.</p>

<p>This seems like great news—we get a much better performance at little cost! But there is a potential wrinkle: pre-trained models turn out to have a variety of undesirable biases. For example, they can disproportionately rely on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12231">texture</a>, on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09994">image background</a>, or on <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/hash/97af07a14cacba681feacf3012730892-Abstract.html">object location/orientation</a>. These biases even arise in production-level pretrained models—Amazon’s Rekognition, for example, <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-finds-gender-skin-type-bias-artificial-intelligence-systems-0212">performs disparately across races and genders</a>. Could these biases show up in our target model, despite our careful curation of our target dataset?</p>

<p>In our most recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02842">work</a>, we find that biases from pre-trained models indeed tend to “transfer”, i.e., they can manifest themselves in the resulting model. In particular, we study this “bias transfer” through the lens of the following questions:</p>

<ol type="a">
  <li>When can bias transfer happen? What is the effect of the pre-training dataset, the transfer learning algorithm, and the target dataset on this bias transfer? Moreover, can we avoid bias transfer altogether by intervening on our target dataset?
</li>
  <li>Does bias transfer actually happen in practice? For example, suppose we pre-train a model on the ImageNet-1K dataset and use transfer learning to adapt it to CIFAR-10. Can we pinpoint concrete biases of the resulting model that are not present when we train on CIFAR-10 from scratch?</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll dive into some of these questions below (see our paper for a more thorough treatment).</p>

<h2 id="when-does-bias-transfer-occur">(When) does bias transfer occur?</h2>
<p>Let us consider a simple experiment. We take the ImageNet-1K dataset (a popular pre-training dataset for transfer learning), and add a small yellow square to every image of a dog in its training set:
<img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/bias-transfer/images/yellowsquare_only.jpg" style="width: 25%; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;" alt="Yellow Square" /></p>

<p>As expected, training on this dataset yields a model that is highly sensitive to the presence of yellow squares. Indeed, when the yellow square is planted on images of other (non-dog) objects, the model predicts a dog class 44% of the time (as opposed to 2% for a standard ImageNet model)!</p>

<p>We now want to use this yellow square sensitivity as a (simple) example of a bias in a pre-trained model. Specifically, to study the possibility of bias transfer, we apply transfer learning to obtain models for a variety of target tasks using both this biased model and a standard ImageNet model as the point of start. We then examine whether transfer learning from the biased model leads to a significantly higher sensitivity to yellow squares. (Note that none of the target datasets have any of these yellow squares at all.)</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/bias-transfer/images/yellowsquare.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Yellow Square Summary" /></p>

<p>As we find, models that are transferred from the biased pre-trained network were significantly more sensitive to the presence of our yellow square. This happened consistently across two transfer learning techniques (fixed-feature and full-network transfer learning) and a variety of datasets we considered.  For example, below, we plot the attack success rate (ASR)—the probability that introducing a yellow square into a random image will flip a model’s prediction—for models transferred from both the biased (Spurious) model and standard (Non-Spurious) model:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/bias-transfer/images/mega_vary_dataset.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Vary Dataset" />
</p>

<p>However, what happens if we try to more carefully design the target dataset to specifically counter bias transfer? For example, if in this case we’re worried that our pre-trained model has a bias associating the yellow square with the “dog” classes, we might put an extra effort and alter the target dataset to make sure that (a) the yellow square is also present in some of the images but (b) its presence is not correlated with any of the classes.  So, is using such a “de-biased” target dataset enough to avoid bias transfer?</p>

<p>Turns out that the answer is: it depends! Specifically, we find that when using a particular kind of transfer learning (full-network transfer learning), adding the backdoor trigger to the target dataset indeed mitigates bias transfer. However, when using the fixed-feature transfer learning, the transferred model still contains the bias—even when 10% of the target dataset contains (uncorrelated) yellow squares.</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/bias-transfer/images/debias_mega.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0;" alt="Debias Dataset" />
</p>

<p>So overall, not only does bias transfer across various datasets and transfer learning settings, it also might be non-trivial (at least in the fixed-feature transfer learning setting) to remedy this bias transfer even when we are aware of the possibility of that bias and try to explicitly de-bias the target dataset.</p>

<h2 id="bias-transfer-in-the-wild">Bias Transfer in the Wild</h2>
<p>Ok, so we know now that bias transfer <em>can</em> happen—at least when there’s a significant bias planted in the source pre-trained model. But in practice, source datasets will rarely have a feature as consistent and predictive as a planted yellow square we considered above. Can biases naturally occurring in common image datasets transfer as well?</p>

<p>It turns out that the answer here is: yes, too! For instance, let’s consider a (rather unsurprising) bias arising in the widely-used ImageNet dataset: a circular yellow shape is predictive for the “tennis ball” class. (See our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02842">paper</a> for many other examples and datasets.) Indeed, as we can see below, if we overlay a yellow circle on any ImageNet image, the model becomes more likely to output “tennis ball:”</p>

<div style="overflow: auto; text-align: center;" id="bias_examples_widget"></div>
<div class="footnote">
    Shift in ImageNet predictions when we apply an intervention, such as overlaying a tennis ball on the image. Click through the thumbnails on the left to see more interventions.
</div>

<p>Now, what happens if we use transfer learning to obtain a model for a target task, such as CIFAR-10 from  a pre-trained ImageNet model containing this yellow circle -&gt; “tennis ball” bias? Even though CIFAR-10 does not contain the yellow circle -&gt; “tennis ball” bias, this bias still persists in the resulting transfer-learned model! In particular, when we evaluate our model on CIFAR-10 test set images overlaid with a yellow circle, the model fine-tuned from a pre-trained ImageNet model is far more sensitive to that signal than a CIFAR-10 model trained from scratch. Indeed, there is an overall skew of the output class distribution for the transfer-learned model, in contrast to an almost uniform output class distribution of the model trained from scratch.</p>

<div style="overflow: auto; text-align: center;" id="cifar_examples_widget"></div>
<div class="footnote">
    Shift in CIFAR-10 predictions after applying an intervention when either training from scratch or transferring from a biased source model. We consider fixed-feature (left) or full-network (right) fine-tuning. The models which were pre-trained on a biased model are more sensitive to the intervention than those trained from scratch. 
</div>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>In this post, we discussed our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02842">recent work</a> that demonstrates that biases that exist in pretrained models can persist even if these models are adapted to target datasets which do not contain these biases. It is thus important to understand the biases of the pre-trained models one uses for transfer learning, even if the task these models were pre-trained on do not seem relevant to the target task we want to solve. This prudence is particularly key in the context of high-stakes real-world machine learning applications that often suffer from data scarcity and tend to use transfer learning as a remedy for that.</p></div>

<h2>Hugo Duminil-Copin, June Huh, James Maynard and Maryna Viazovska were awarded the Fields Medal 2022 and Mark Braverman was awarded the Abacus Medal 2022.</h2>
<p>I am writing from Helsinki where I attended the meeting of the General Assembly of the IMU and yesterday I took part in the moving award ceremonies of ICM2022 hosted by Aalto University.  This will be the first post about the ICM 2020 award ceremonies.</p>
<p>The opening day of ICM2022 was exciting. Hugo Duminil-Copin, June Huh, James Maynard and Maryna Viazovska were awarded the Fields Medals 2022. Mark Braverman was awarded the Abacus Medal. The event <a href="https://youtu.be/6I0siVD7RBI">was videotaped and can be found here</a>. <strong>Update</strong>: The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh2gqiEC6eM">five lectures of the medalists can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>In the ceremony, I gave the laudation for June Huh.  Here are <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/jhicm2022.pptx">the slides of my talk.</a> The preliminary version of my proceeding paper is <a href="https://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/IMU/Prizes/Fields/2022/laudatio-jh.pdf">here on the IMU site</a>. Please alert me about mistakes in my paper or if you have any suggestions for changes or additions. (I already found that on two occasions I embarrassingly wrote “Brändén” Instead of “Braden”, sorry for that.) <strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/laudatio-jh-20220709.pdf">Here is a corrected version.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mathunion.org/imu-awards/fields-medal/fields-medals-2022">The IMU site</a> contains a lot of material about the Fields medalist and other prize winners. It contains beautiful videos, and preliminary versions of the proceeding papers by the medalists and by those giving the laudations.</p>
<p>Andrei Okounkov wrote four wonderful detailed “popular scientific expositions” (those are available on the IMU site) which provide much scientific background as well as Andrei’s own scientific perspective. It is a great read for wide audience of mathematicians, ranging from  advanced undergraduate students.  Experts will also enjoy Andrei’s perspective.</p>
<h2>Svetlana Jitomirskaya was awarded the Ladyzhenskaya Prize in Mathematical Physics (in a ceremony held two days earlier), Barry Mazur was awarded the Chern Medal, Elliott Lieb was awarded the Gauss Prize, and Nikolai Andreev was awarded the Leelavati Prize.</h2>
<p>I hope to discuss these awards and some further personal and mathematical reflections in a subsequent post.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Congratulations Hugo, June, James, Maryna, Mark, Svetlana, Barry, Elliott, and Nikolai!</strong></span></h3>
<h3>Here on my Blog</h3>
<p>Let me give some links to discussions here on the blog on works by laureates.</p>
<p>I wrote about Maryna Viazovska’s amazing breakthrough in the post  <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2016/03/23/a-breakthrough-by-maryna-viazovska-lead-to-the-long-awaited-solutions-for-the-densest-packing-problem-in-dimensions-8-and-24/" rel="bookmark">A Breakthrough by Maryna Viazovska Leading to the Long Awaited Solutions for the Densest Packing Problem in Dimensions 8 and 24, </a>and this additional post <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/02/15/henry-cohn-abhinav-kumar-stephen-d-miller-danylo-radchenko-and-maryna-viazovska-universal-optimality-of-the-e8-and-leech-lattices-and-interpolation-formulas/" rel="bookmark">Henry Cohn, Abhinav Kumar, Stephen D. Miller, Danylo Radchenko, and Maryna Viazovska: Universal optimality of the E8 and Leech lattices and interpolation formulas.</a></p>
<p>I reported here in 2009 on <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2009/01/23/news/">the startling solution by Mark Braverman of the Linial-Nisan conjecture</a>.</p>
<p>The story of James Maynard’s startling results and the gap between primes story is <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2013/09/20/polymath-8-a-success/">described in this post</a>.  In July 2014 we ran at HUJI a beautiful <a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/conf/joram.html">learning seminar on small gaps between primes,</a> where James Maynard gave a series of three lectures. His result on “bounded intervals containing many primes” both strengthened and simplified Yitang Zhang’s earlier amazing result on “bounded intervals containing two primes.”  Maynard developed large chunks of his approach independently from Zhang’s work.</p>
<p>I discussed two results by Hugo Duminil-Copin : After the start of the pandemic but before the war in Ukraine, I had a “cheer-you-up in difficult times” corner and<a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2021/03/23/to-cheer-you-up-in-difficult-times-22-some-mathematical-news-part-1/"> in this post, </a> to cheer you up,  I wrote about a breakthrough by Hugo Duminil-Copin, Karol Kajetan Kozlowski, Dmitry Krachun, Ioan Manolescu, Mendes Oulamara  (and yet another wonderful result by Hugo Vanneuville and Vincent Tasion). In <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/04/01/two-delightful-major-simplifications/">this 2015 post</a> I wrote about another breakthrough by Hugo Duminil-Copinand Vincent Tasion. (And see <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2017/08/24/where-were-we/">this post</a> for <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/hugo-kkl.jpg">a picture</a> of Hugo mentioning KKL and BKKKL.)</p>
<p>And,  of course, I wrote about June Huh several times. Here are a few examples: About Huh’s 2018 ICM talk; <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/12/24/icm-2018-rio-4-huh-balog-morris-wormald/" rel="bookmark">ICM 2018 Rio (4): Huh; Balog &amp; Morris; Wormald</a>; about the Mihail-vazirani conjecture  <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/12/12/nima-anari-kuikui-liu-shayan-oveis-gharan-and-cynthia-vinzant-solved-the-mihail-vazirani-conjecture/" rel="bookmark">Nima Anari, Kuikui Liu, Shayan Oveis Gharan, and Cynthia Vinzant Solved the Mihail-Vazirani Conjecture for Matroids! </a>; <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2011/06/14/tentative-plans-and-belated-updates-ii/">About the early works on the Heron-Rota-Welsh conjecture for representable matroids</a>; and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/08/14/updates-and-plans-iii/">about the full solution of the Heron-Rota-Welsh conjecture by Adiprasito, Huh, and Katz.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2021/03/23/to-cheer-you-up-in-difficult-times-22-some-mathematical-news-part-1/">In this post</a> we tried to cheer you up with “harmonic polytope”, which came up in Ardila, Denham, and Huh’s work on the Lagrangian geometry of matroids and were further studied by Federico Ardila and Laura Escobar.</p>

<p>This week I should be celebrating Mark Braverman's <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mark-braverman-wins-the-imu-abacus-medal-20220705/">Abacus Medal</a> and the <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/2022-fields-and-abacus-medals/">Fields Medalists</a>. Instead my mind has been focused 25 miles north of Chicago.</p><p>Mass shootings in the United States have become far too commonplace, but the shooting at a fourth of July parade in Highland Park, Illinois hit home. Literally Highland Park was home for me, from 2003-2012. We've been in downtown Highland Park hundreds of times. We've attended their fourth of July parade in the past. My daughter participated in it as part of the high school marching band. </p><p>We were members of North Shore Congregation Israel. My wife, who had a party planning business back then, worked closely with NSCI events coordinator Jacki Sundhein, tragically killed in the attack.</p><p>We lived close to Bob's Deli and Pantry and we'd often walk over there for sandwiches or snacks, sometimes served by Bob Crimo himself. The alleged shooter, Bobby Crimo, was his son.</p><p>We spent the fourth with friends who came down from Glencoe, the town just south of Highland Park. We spent much of the day just searching for updates on our phones.</p><p>I wish we could find ways to reduce the shootings in Highland Park and those like it, the violence that plagues Chicago and other major cities and the highly polarized world we live in which both hampers real gun reforms and creates online groups that help enable these awful events. But right now I just mourn for the lives lost in the town that was my home, a town that will never fully recover from this tragedy.</p></div>

<p>These days, our colleagues at IRIF are hosting <a href="https://icalp2022.irif.fr/" target="_blank">ICALP 2022</a> in Paris. This is the 49th edition of the ICALP conference, which turns 50 since its first instalment was held in 1972. ICALP was the first conference of the, then newly founded, <a href="https://eatcs.org/" target="_blank">European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS)</a>.The rest is history and I let any readers this post might have draw their own conclusions on the role that the EATCS and ICALP have played in supporting the development of theoretical computer science. (Admittedly, my opinions on both the EATCS and ICALP are very biased.) </p><p>The <a href="https://icalp2022.irif.fr/?page_id=42" target="_blank">scientific programme of ICALP 2022</a> is mouthwatering as usual, thanks to the work done by the authors of submitted papers, Mikołaj Bojańczyk and David Woodruff (PC chairs), and their PCs. I encourage everyone to read the papers that are being presented at the conference.</p><p>The main purpose of this post, however, is to alert the readers of this blog that ICALP 2022 also hosts an <a href="https://icalp2022.irif.fr/?page_id=1111" target="_blank">exhibition to celebrate EATCS/ICALP at 50</a> and theoretical computer science at large. If you are in Paris, you can attend the exhibition in person. Otherwise, you can visit it virtually <a href="https://icalp2022.irif.fr/?page_id=1111" target="_blank">here</a>. (See also the posters in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L7wLDYyDCNfSCvnNA8jWZiMb3BRLy14k/view" target="_blank">one PDF file</a>.)<br /></p><p>I had the honour to take part in the preparation of the material for that exhibition, which was led by Sandrine Cadet and Sylvain Schmitz. I learnt a lot from all the other colleagues in the committee for the exhibition. </p><p>As part of that work, I asked <a href="https://www.pilucrescenzi.it/" target="_blank">Pierluigi Crescenzi</a> whether he'd be willing to carry out a graph and data mining analysis of ICALP vis-a-vis other major conferences in theoretical computer science based on DBLP data. Pierluigi's work went well beyond the call of duty and is summarised in <a href="https://slides.com/piluc/icalp-50?token=fl3BBJ8j" target="_blank">this presentation</a>. I trust that you'll find the results of the analysis by Pierluigi and three of his students at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/gssi.it/csgssi" target="_blank">Gran Sasso Science Institute</a> very interesting. If you have any suggestions for expanding that analysis further, please write it in the comment section. </p><p>Let me close by wishing the EATCS and ICALP a happy 50th birthday, and a great scientific and social event to all the colleagues who are attending ICALP 2022. <br /></p></div>
