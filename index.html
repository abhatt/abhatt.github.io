<p>Complexity is at its best when it models new technologies so we can study it in a principled way. Quantum computing comes to mind as a good relatively recent example. With machine learning playing an every growing role in computing, how can complexity play a role?</p><p>The theory community questions about machine learning typically look at finding mathematical reasons to explain why the models well with little overfitting or trying to get good definitions of privacy, fairness, explainability to mitigate the social challenges of ML. But what about from a computational complexity point of view? I don't have a great answer yet but here are some thoughts.</p><p>In much of structural complexity, we use relativization to understand the relative power of complexity classes. We define an oracle as a set A where a machine can ask questions about membership to A and magically get an answer. Relativization can be used to help us define classes like Σ<sub>2</sub><sup>P</sup> = NP<sup>NP</sup> or allow us to succinctly state <a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/0220053">Toda's theorem</a> as PH in P<sup>#P</sup>.</p><p>As I <a href="https://twitter.com/fortnow/status/1453827400383488002">tweeted</a> last week, machine learning feels like an oracle, after all machine learning models and algorithms are typically accessed through APIs and Python modules. What kind of oracle? Definitely not an NP-complete problem like SAT since machine learning fails miserably if you try to use it to break cryptography. </p><p>The real information in machine learning comes from the data. For a length parameter n, consider a string x which might be exponential in n. Think of x as a list of labeled or unlabeled examples of some larger set S. Machine learning creates a model M from x that tries to predict whether x is in S. Think of M as the oracle, as some compressed version of S.</p><p>Is there a computational view of M? We can appeal to Ockham's razor and consider the simplest model consistent with the data for which x as a set are random in the S that M generates. One can formalize this Minimum Description Length approach using <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/18.825807">Kolmogorov Complexity</a>. This model is too ideal, for one it can also break cryptography, and typical deep learning models are not simple at all with sometimes millions of parameters.</p><p>This is just a start. One could try time bounds on the Kolmogorov definitions or try something different completely. Adversarial and foundational learning models might yield different kinds of oracles. </p><p>If we can figure out even a rough complexity way to understand learning, we can start to get a hold of learning's computational power and limitations, which is the purpose of studying complexity complexity in the first place. </p></div>

We describe an explicit and simple subset of the discrete hypercube which cannot be exactly covered by fewer than exponentially many hyperplanes. The proof exploits a connection to communication complexity, and relies heavily on Razborov's lower bound for disjointness.</div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo is a widely used class of algorithms for sampling from high-dimensional probability distributions, both in theory and in practice. While simple to implement, analyzing the rate of convergence to stationarity, i.e. the “mixing time”, remains a challenging problem in many settings. We introduce a new technique to bound mixing times called “spectral independence”, which says that certain pairwise correlation matrices all have bounded spectral norm. This surprisingly powerful technique originates in the emerging study of high-dimensional expanders, and has allowed us to “unify” nearly all existing approaches to approximate counting and sampling by building new connections with other areas, including statistical physics, geometry of polynomials, functional analysis, and more. Through these connections, several long-standing open problems have recently been answered, including counting bases of matroids and optimal mixing of the Glauber dynamics/Gibbs sampler up to the algorithmic phase transition threshold.</p>
<p>Based on several joint works with Dorna Abdolazimi, Nima Anari, Zongchen Chen, Shayan Oveis Gharan, Eric Vigoda, Cynthia Vinzant, and June Vuong.</p></blockquote></div>

<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from 
<a class="entryheader" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/" title="11011110">David Eppstein</a>
<p>
</div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_tessellation">Gilbert tessellation</a> is what you get from choosing a random set of points-with-slopes in the plane, growing line segments in both directions with the chosen slope from each chosen point, at constant speed, and stopping the growth when each line segment runs into something else. The slopes can be in uniformly random directions but one standard variant of the Gilbert tessellation uses only horizontal and vertical slopes.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gilbert_tessellation_axis.svg"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2018/Gilbert-rectangles.svg" alt="Axis-aligned Gilbert tessellation subdivides the plane into rectangles, by Claudio Rocchini" /></a></p>

<p>My paper “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.2890">Growth and decay in life-like cellular automata</a>” observed that the Life-like cellular automaton rule B017/S1, when started with a sufficiently sparse random set of live cells, forms lines of replicators that look sort of like one of these axis-parallel Gilbert tessellations, as I discussed in <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2018/12/27/motorcycle-graphs-eventual.html">a previous post on sparse Life</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2018/b017s1.png" alt="Replicator chaos in B017/S1" /></p>

<p>But it’s a bit messy: you also get stable or oscillating blobs of live cells, and replicators can sometimes make large gaps big enough for something else to get across them, rather than forming the impenetrable barriers that the segments of a true Gilbert tessellation would do. So I wondered: how easy is it to get Gilbert tessellations with less mess, in a cellular automaton?</p>

<p>Very easy, if you’re willing to make an automaton that hardcodes into its rules the construction process of a Gilbert tessellation. For instance, make an automaton on an infinite square grid with three states, empty, horizontal, and vertical. Horizontal cells always stay horizontal, and vertical cells always stay vertical. Empty cells with exactly one non-empty neighbor that is either a horizontally-adjacent horizontal cell or a vertically-adjacent vertical cell take on the same state as that neighbor, and otherwise stay empty. Then any horizontal cells will grow into horizontal walls, and vertical cells will grow into vertical walls, at constant speed, until running into other non-empty cells, just as the Gilbert tessellation definition demands. If you start with a sparse random set of non-empty cells of both types, you should get a Gilbert tessellation, more or less by definition. But controlling horizontal versus vertical growth by different cell states rather than by the pattern of live cells seems kind of a cheat. It makes creating Gilbert tessellations the only thing this three-state automaton can do, rather than an emergent behavior of the automaton. And it isn’t even symmetric under 90-degree rotations (although it does have a symmetry that combines rotation with state-swapping). Is there an automaton with only two states, and natural symmetric rules that can do other things but that when seeded randomly generates non-messy Gilbert tessellations?</p>

<p>Yes! I don’t know of a Life-like rule that does this (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_without_Death">Life without death</a> does make nice impenetrable walls but with too much other stuff). But I think the rule below fits the bill. It’s the first thing I tried, at least, so I didn’t have to do any fine adjustments of the rules to make it work.</p>

<p>Here’s the rule:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The cells form a square grid with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood">Moore 8-cell neighborhood</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are two states of cells, live and dead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A dead cell becomes live only under two conditions:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>It has exactly two live neighbors (among its eight possible neighbors) that are orthogonally adjacent to each other.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It has exactly four live neighbors at the corners of a rectangle (necessarily in two orthogonally adjacent pairs, because we don’t count squares as being rectangles).</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All live cells immediately die.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/gilbert/rule.svg" alt="Rules for the Gilbert cellular automaton" /></p>

<p>Or, in <a href="http://golly.sourceforge.net/">Golly</a> rule format:</p>

<pre>@RULE Gilbert
@TABLE
n_states:2
neighborhood:Moore
symmetries:rotate8reflect
var a={0,1}
var b={0,1}
var c={0,1}
var d={0,1}
var e={0,1}
var f={0,1}
var g={0,1}
var h={0,1}
0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1
1,a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,0</pre>

<p>Then an initial pattern of two orthogonally adjacent live cells (a “domino”) will in the next step form two side-by-side dominos, in the step after that three dominos (with the center one in the initial location), and so on, building a wall two cells wide that alternates between dominos and dead cells, and oscillates with period two.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/gilbert/wall.svg" alt="Wall of alternating dominos in the Gilbert cellular automaton" /></p>

<p>Here’s what it looks like when I selected a large rectangle, randomly filled it with 2% live cells, and ran it in Golly. The red lines in this image are walls like the one above.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/gilbert/wide.png" alt="Gilbert cellular automaton on a sparse random field" /></p>

<p>Of course, at the edges of the randomly filled rectangle, the walls shoot off to infinity with no more obstructions. Here’s a closeup, showing the detailed pattern of the walls and how they meet:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/gilbert/crop.png" alt="Close-up of Gilbert cellular automaton on a sparse random field" /></p>

<p>It looks a lot like a Gilbert tessellation to me! Even starting with a 50% random fill produces the same sort of pattern at a finer scale:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/gilbert/5050.png" alt="Gilbert cellular automaton on a 50/50 random field" /></p>

<p>But rather than just going by intuitive visual appearance here’s some analysis showing that, if the plane is filled with live cells with some small probability \(p\), and then this rule is run on the result, then as \(p\to0\) the probability of seeing something that looks like a Gilbert tessellation in the neighborhood of any cell will tend to one. By “neighborhood” I mean everything within distance \(r\), where \(r\) should be chosen as a function of \(p\) that grows faster than linearly in \(1/p\) (so that we have nontrivial probability of seeing something other than just empty space) but slower than \((1/p)^{4/3}\).</p>

<p>The reason we need to limit the radius of the neighborhoods is that, in a large enough neighborhood, you will likely see something that deviates from a Gilbert tessellation. In the runs above, for instance, there are some right-angle corners where two line segments both meet and stop, or points where it appears that walls met head-to-head, but this should’t happen in a Gilbert tessellation (or more precisely it happens with probability zero). There are two natural ways of getting a corner: you could start with an L-tromino of live cells, or two growing walls could coincidentally run into each other. But the expected number of triples of nearby live cells within the neighborhood is \(O(p^3r^2)\), and the expected number of pairs of dominos whose walls would meet at the same point is \(O(p^4r^3)\). It might also be the case that three or more initial live cells produce more exotic behavior; if so, the expected number of things like this that happen within the neighborhood is still \(O(p^3r^2)\). With our assumption on the growth rate of \(r\) relative to \(p\), these expected numbers, and therefore the probability of seeing any of these situations within the neighborhood, is negligible. For the same reason they have low probability of occurring close enough to the neighborhood to impinge on it before the Gilbert tessellation within the neighborhood forms.</p>

<p>So with high probability, in neighborhoods of radius \(r\), you’ll only see single live cells and double live cells in the initial state, and the pairs of double cells won’t be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally aligned with each other. Some of the double live cells will be dominos, with density \(\Theta(p^2)\). The only thing that can happen with such a state is that dominos start building walls which grow until they hit each other, exactly as described by a Gilbert tessellation. Once the Gilbert tessellation has been set up, it appears indestructible: the alternating live cells along the wall prevent any births into the layers of dead cells on either side, and if a wall is perturbed at its end it quickly grows back. However, proving this indestructability rigorously would require a more careful case analysis.</p>

Lesley Smith is a climate researcher at the University of Colorado’s Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences. She is also <a href="https://psl.noaa.gov/people/lesley.l.smith/">associated</a> to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Physical Science Laboratory and has worked on behalf of several other national organizations. Her PhD was in particle physics at the University of Kansas, and she incorporates quantum physics into some of her non-nonfiction writings.</p>
<p>
Today we discuss a quantum walk on a simple graph with behavior wild enough to inspire at least the latter kind of writing.</p>
<p>
Smith was most recently second author on a <a href="https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/31032">paper</a> in the April, 2021 <em>Journal of Climate</em> whose title immediately speaks a vital subject: “Explaining the Spatial Pattern of U.S. Extreme Daily Precipitation Change.” The years-long <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/drought-grips-american-west-with-no-relief-in-sight/">drought</a> in the US West has critically depleted lakes and reservoirs and rivers. But just one week ago, much of California had its <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/10/25/atmospheric-river-record-rain-california/">wettest</a> day ever. Both the drought and the pattern of extremes have spread across the country, as many easily-found stories this year attest. The question is how to distinguish standard fluctuations from deep-seated causal factors.</p>
<p>
As for her <a href="http://www.lesleylsmith.com/index.html">other</a> <a href="http://www.lesleylsmith.com/blog.html">writings</a>, this is representative:</p>

The first lines are likewise topical: “Despite it being October, the sun felt warm on my skin. Forest-fire smoke from states west of Colorado gave the air a three-dimensional quality…” She has also written novels titled <em>Quantum Murder</em>, <em>The Quantum Cop</em>, and <em>Quantum Juneteenth</em>, plus just now a <a href="http://www.lesleylsmith.com/shortfiction.html">short story</a>, “Lucky Halloween,” about a quantum computer scientist. She is writing a series called <em>Kat Cubed</em>—well we will raise Schrödinger cat-walks to powers well beyond cubed below.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Climate and Dynamism </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The climate paper’s opening paragraphs review the the general prediction of greater precipitation from the thermal component of climate change and the effects of changes in atmospheric currents. Then it observes:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Yet, the regional pattern of observed heavy precipitation trends across the United States departs from this theoretical expectation, being remarkable for its heterogeneity rather than the more uniform structure that thermodynamic effects alone would predict. … The regionally diverse trends in extreme precipitation are likely related to dynamical factors. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The paper speaks to care needed to distinguish causes and draws two conclusions:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> First, the absence of appreciable increases [in annual maximum single day of rain] over the West is attributed to a dynamical effect of the observed centennial-scale trends in [sea-surface temperature], sea ice, and atmospheric composition. … A second factor is sampling variability […from…] a combination of moderate forced increases comingled with a strong articulation of internal atmospheric variability. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The nub of the latter from my perspective is distinguishing what we can infer on the basis of increased dynamism alone. In our <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2014/01/30/global-warming/">post</a> seven years ago on global warming, I opined that greater energy and dynamism should be treated as more-primary effects than temperature. The challenge of inferring further effects from dynamism is recognized by another excerpt from the conclusions:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Recognizing the potency of unforced atmospheric dynamics, [one cannot discount] a scenario in which internal variability could mute if not reverse the observed upward trend in eastern U.S. [extreme rains]. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
In the rest of this post, we’ll offer an example of wild dynamics from a small quantum system that may speak to both her <em>métiers</em>.</p>

The walker cannot go from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1}" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{3}" class="latex" /> in one step because there is no edge.

<p>gives the probabilities for each node after two steps. (Although multiplying row vectors on the left is commonly used for classical walks, we will use column vectors for consistency with quantum usage; that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA_G%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A_G}" class="latex" /> is symmetric moots the difference anyway.) For any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{t}" class="latex" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5E%7B%28t%29%7D+%3D+A_G%5Et+x_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x^{(t)} = A_G^t x_0}" class="latex" /> can be called the “classical state” of the walk after <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{t}" class="latex" /> steps. </p>
<p>
The state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> whose entries <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Bi%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x[i]}" class="latex" /> are given by the degree of node <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{i}" class="latex" /> divided by the sum of the degrees makes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA_G+x+%3D+x%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A_G x = x}" class="latex" />, and thus gives a <b>stable distribution</b> for the walk. A central theorem states that for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> that is not bipartite, the powers of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA_G%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A_G}" class="latex" /> converge entrywise in every column to a unique stable distribution. When <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> is regular, as here, this is simply the uniform distribution. The convergence in our case is quite quick, as signified by the exact values </p>

The quantum case needs to bind the graph and the “coin” into one system, so its domain has six members, which we list in order </p>

<p>In quantum notation, this is the tensor product of the “node space” <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV+%3D+%5C%7B1%2C2%2C3%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{V = \{1,2,3\}}" class="latex" /> and the “coin space” <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D+%3D+%5C%7BH%2CT%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathcal{C} = \{H,T\}}" class="latex" />. The meaning of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28v%2C%5Cmathfrak%7Bc%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{(v,\mathfrak{c})}" class="latex" /> is that the walker just arrived at node <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{v}" class="latex" /> via the coin outcome <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathfrak%7Bc%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathfrak{c}}" class="latex" />. It is incumbent that every node <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{v}" class="latex" /> can be reached on either outcome. Our <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" />–<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T}" class="latex" /> labeling above complies. Then we get a permutation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" /> on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" /> from the action </p>

<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{v'}" class="latex" /> is the vertex reached from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{v}" class="latex" /> by the outcome <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathfrak%7Bc%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathfrak{c}}" class="latex" /> from the classical walk, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathfrak%7Bc%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathfrak{c}}" class="latex" /> is kept the same. The penultimate trick is to expand this to a mapping <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%27%3A+%5Cmathcal%7BS%7D+%5Ctimes+%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathcal%7BS%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P': \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}}" class="latex" /> by </p>

<p>whereby the previous coin outcome <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathfrak%7Bb%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathfrak{b}}" class="latex" /> is “forgotten” while the current flip is preserved in the state. We can represent this by the <em>directed</em> graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G'}" class="latex" /> shown next. </p>

<p>We have drawn lines to show how the coin acts between each pair of nodes. Notice that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbf%7BW%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathbf{W}}" class="latex" /> is no longer symmetric, so specifying column-vector inputs matters. For instance, the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{b}" class="latex" /> in the top row comes in from the column at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1T%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1T}" class="latex" /> and exits at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1H}" class="latex" />. This means the previous coin result was tails and took the walker (from node 2) to node <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1}" class="latex" />; now the coin gives heads so the walker stays at node <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1}" class="latex" />. We can diagram this action also on the expanded graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G'}" class="latex" />, so that the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{b}" class="latex" /> goes on the arrow from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1T%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1T}" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1H}" class="latex" />, and so on:</p>

<p>
The first step has no “previous coin result” but we still have to specify one to initialize the coin state as well as the walker’s state. For starting on node <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1}" class="latex" /> there is still an infinitude of combinations of the basis states <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1H}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1T%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1T}" class="latex" />. If we fix the start as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1H}" class="latex" />, this is like saying the coin was heads-up before the initial act of flipping it.</p>

Over all paths that end at the same <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathfrak%7Bs%7D%3D%28v%2C%5Cmathfrak%7Bc%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathfrak{s}=(v,\mathfrak{c})}" class="latex" /> we add those products to give the <b>amplitude</b> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba_%7Bu%2Cv%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{a_{u,v}}" class="latex" />, which in our column-first notation equals the entry <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbf%7BW%7D%5Et%5B%5Cmathfrak%7Bs%7D%2C%5Cmathfrak%7Bs%7D_0%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathbf{W}^t[\mathfrak{s},\mathfrak{s}_0]}" class="latex" />. </p>
<p>
For example, there are two paths of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%3D3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{t=3}" class="latex" /> steps from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1H}" class="latex" /> back to itself. One takes the loop at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1H}" class="latex" /> three times and contributes the phase value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1}" class="latex" />, but the other does <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1H%5Crightarrow+2T+%5Crightarrow+1T+%5Crightarrow+1H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1H\rightarrow 2T \rightarrow 1T \rightarrow 1H}" class="latex" /> and picks up the value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{-1}" class="latex" />. Adding those values cancels them, leaving the red <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{0}" class="latex" /> shown at upper left in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbf%7BW%7D%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathbf{W}^3}" class="latex" />. If our walker is a Schrödinger cat, that part of it is not just “dead” but completely annihilated.</p>

It is still possible for the cat to end on node <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1}" class="latex" /> after being cubed, because the path <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1H+%5Crightarrow+1H+%5Crightarrow+2T+%5Crightarrow+1T%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1H \rightarrow 1H \rightarrow 2T \rightarrow 1T}" class="latex" /> is not canceled. That the cat ends with phase <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{-1}" class="latex" /> does not matter, because to get the probabilities—given we started at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1H}" class="latex" />—we take the squared magnitude of each entry in column <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1}" class="latex" /> and add the adjacent pairs denoting the same vertex of the original graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" />.

Most treatments of quantum walks, including a seminal <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0012090">paper</a> by Dorit Aharonov, Andris Ambainis, Julia Kempe, and Umesh Vazirani, and an influential 2003 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303081">survey</a> by Kempe, emphasize the dispersion time being linear rather than quadratic as in classical random walks on undirected graphs. Here, the quadratic nature effects quick divergence between close states like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathfrak%7Bs%7D_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathfrak{s}_0}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathfrak%7Bs%7D_%7B38%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathfrak{s}_{38}}" class="latex" />, which is the signature of dynamical chaos. </p>
<p>
The coin <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BJ%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+1+%26+i+%5C%5C+i+%26+1%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{J} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; i \\ i &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}}" class="latex" /> is reputed to make quantum walks smoother. That works to some extent for our three-node graph, but there appears to be no periodic stability, let alone convergence as in the classical case. Simple Python code for trying other coins is available <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/cse610/qtipwalk.py">here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Real or Fiction? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Our main question is simple: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Are these crazy walks real? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The answer is <em>yes</em> if we can engineer a qutrit+qubit system that evolves by repeating <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbf%7BW%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathbf{W}}" class="latex" />. <em>Simulating</em> such a system throws up a second issue: No one would say that the classical computer executing my Python code is behaving chaotically. We can program <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbf%7BW%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathbf{W}}" class="latex" /> via basic gates available to run on real hardware at <a href="https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/">IBM Quantum</a> or some other services. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Is quantum hardware that applies powers of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbf%7BW%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathbf{W}}" class="latex" /> behaving chaotically? Does that pose a concretely physical impediment to maintaining its coherence? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
On expecting a <em>yes</em> answer to the walks’ physical existence in the microworld, our questions next try to connect to Smith’s paper:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Does the mathematical existence of chaotic quantum systems on such small scales have macroscopic effects in our world? Such as on the chaotic dynamics of our atmosphere? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Again, the answer should be <em>yes</em> at the level of <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-09718-X_73">connecting</a> Brownian motion to quantum processes, or of quantum-walk <a href="https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:08ad4a94-483d-46db-8840-6f73c3e48a70/datastream/OBJ/download">interpretations</a> of physical systems such as the quantum harmonic oscillator (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_harmonic_oscillator">QHO</a>). So the most specific form of our question is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Does our (not-so-)simple three-node quantum walk appear as a non-negligible term in a Feynman-style summation needed to understand a macroscopic physical system? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Can the quantum chaos of the Q-tip graph be tamed? See <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.00316.pdf">this</a> for success on other graphs including the 3-cycle. There are are affinities between the 3-cycle and Q-tip walks, especially at even timesteps, and the 3-cycle is an option in the Python code.</p>
<p>
Smith also has many activities promoting STEM, including her <a href="http://www.physicsisfun.net/&quot;">Phyiscs Is Fun</a> website and a <a href="https://books2read.com/u/bMavLX">book</a> on particle physics.  She maintains a <a href="http://www.lesleylsmith.com/blog.html">blog</a> of her writing and reading, plus much else on her <a href="http://www.lesleylsmith.com/">author site</a>.

<p><b>Authors: </b>Onur Çağırıcı <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00609">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>This thesis focuses on two concepts which are widely studied in the field of
computational geometry. Namely, visibility and unit disk graphs. In the field
of visibility, we have studied the conflict-free chromatic guarding of
polygons, for which we have described a polynomial-time algorithm that uses
$O(n \log^2 n)$ colors to guard a polygon in a conflict-free setting, and
proper coloring of polygon visibility graphs, for which we have described an
algorithm that returns a proper 4-coloring for a simple polygon. Besides, we
have shown that the 5-colorability problem is NP-complete on visibility graphs
of simple polygons, and 4-colorability is NP-complete on visibility graphs of
polygons with holes.
</p>
<p>Then, we move further with the notion of visibility, and define a graph class
which considers the real-world limitations for the applications of visibility
graphs. That is, no physical object has infinite range, and two objects might
not be mutually visible from a certain distance although there are no obstacles
in-between. To model this property, we introduce unit disk visibility graphs,
and show that the 3-colorability problem is NP-complete for unit disk
visibility graphs of a set of line segments, and a polygon with holes.
</p>
<p>After bridging the gap between the visibility and the unit disk graphs, we
then present our results on the recognition of unit disk graphs in a restricted
setting -- axes-parallel unit disk graphs. We show that the recognition of unit
disk graphs is NP-complete when the disks are centered on pre-given parallel
lines. If, on the other hand, the lines are not parallel to one another, the
recognition problem is NP-hard even though the pre-given lines are
axes-parallel (i.e. any pair is either parallel or perpendicular).

Bender</a>, Martín Farach-Colton, John Kuszmaul, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kuszmaul:William.html">William Kuszmaul</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00602">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>For nearly six decades, the central open question in the study of hash tables
has been to determine the optimal achievable tradeoff curve between time and
space. State-of-the-art hash tables offer the following guarantee: If
keys/values are Theta(log n) bits each, then it is possible to achieve
constant-time insertions/deletions/queries while wasting only O(loglog n) bits
of space per key when compared to the information-theoretic optimum. Even prior
to this bound being achieved, the target of O(loglog n) wasted bits per key was
known to be a natural end goal, and was proven to be optimal for a number of
closely related problems (e.g., stable hashing, dynamic retrieval, and
dynamically-resized filters).
</p>
<p>This paper shows that O(loglog n) wasted bits per key is not the end of the
line for hashing. In fact, for any k \in [log* n], it is possible to achieve
O(k)-time insertions/deletions, O(1)-time queries, and O(\log^{(k)} n) wasted
bits per key (all with high probability in n). This means that, each time we
increase insertion/deletion time by an \emph{additive constant}, we reduce the
wasted bits per key \emph{exponentially}. We further show that this tradeoff
curve is the best achievable by any of a large class of hash tables, including
any hash table designed using the current framework for making constant-time
hash tables succinct.

numbers that sum to 0 in a list of $r$ random numbers, each of the order $r^k$,
cannot be done in much less than $r^{\lceil k/2 \rceil}$ time. On the other
hand, in the dense regime of parameters, where the list contains more numbers
and many solutions exist, the complexity of finding one of them can be
significantly improved by Wagner's $k$-tree algorithm. Such algorithms for
$k$-SUM in the dense regime have many applications, notably in cryptanalysis.
</p>
<p>In this paper, assuming the average-case $k$-SUM conjecture, we prove that
known algorithms are essentially optimal for $k= 3,4,5$. For $k&gt;5$, we prove
the optimality of the $k$-tree algorithm for a limited range of parameters. We
also prove similar results for $k$-XOR, where the sum is replaced with
exclusive or.
</p>
<p>Our results are obtained by a self-reduction that, given an instance of
$k$-SUM which has a few solutions, produces from it many instances in the dense
regime. We solve each of these instances using the dense $k$-SUM oracle, and
hope that a solution to a dense instance also solves the original problem. We
deal with potentially malicious oracles (that repeatedly output correlated
useless solutions) by an obfuscation process that adds noise to the dense
instances. Using discrete Fourier analysis, we show that the obfuscation
eliminates correlations among the oracle's solutions, even though its inputs
are highly correlated.

optimal monotone transform on the estimator outputs. We start by studying the
traditional square error setting with its weighted variant and show that the
optimal monotone transform is in the form of a unique staircase function. We
further show that this staircase behavior is preserved for general strictly
convex loss functions. Their optimal monotone transforms are also unique, i.e.,
there exist a single staircase transform that achieves the minimum loss. We
propose a linear time and space algorithm that can find such optimal transforms
for specific loss settings. Our algorithm has an online implementation where
the optimal transform for the samples observed so far are found in linear space
and amortized time when the samples arrive in an ordered fashion. We also
extend our results to cases where the functions are not trivial to individually
optimize and propose an anytime algorithm, which has linear space and
pseudo-linearithmic time complexity.

vertices until only one vertex remains. The recently introduced twin-width
graph invariant is based on contraction sequences. More precisely, if one puts
red edges between two vertices representing non-homogeneous subsets, the
twin-width is the minimum integer $d$ such that a contraction sequence keeps
red degree at most $d$. By changing the condition imposed on the trigraphs
(i.e., graphs with some edges being red) and possibly slightly tweaking the
notion of contractions, we show how to characterize the well-established
bounded rank-width, tree-width, linear rank-width, path-width, and proper
minor-closed classes by means of contraction sequences. As an application we
give a transparent alternative proof of the celebrated Courcelle's theorem
(actually of its generalization by Courcelle, Makowsky, and Rotics), that
MSO$_2$ (resp. MSO$_1$) model checking on graphs with bounded tree-width (resp.
bounded rank-width) is fixed-parameter tractable in the size of the input
sentence.
</p>
<p>We then explore new avenues along the general theme of contraction sequences
both in order to refine the landscape between bounded tree-width and bounded
twin-width (via spanning twin-width) and to capture more general classes than
bounded twin-width. To this end, we define an oriented version of twin-width,
where appearing red edges are oriented away from the newly contracted vertex,
and the mere red out-degree should remain bounded. Surprisingly, classes of
bounded oriented twin-width coincide with those of bounded twin-width. Finally
we examine, from an algorithmic standpoint, the concept of partial contraction
sequences, where, instead of terminating on a single-vertex graph, the sequence
ends when reaching a particular target class.

has increased the need for developing algorithms which can compute formal
concepts quickly. The current efficient algorithms for FCA are variants of the
Close-By-One (CbO) algorithm, such as In-Close2, In-Close3 and In-Close4, which
are all based on horizontal storage of contexts. In this paper, based on
algorithm In-Close4, a new algorithm based on the vertical storage of contexts,
called In-Close5, is proposed, which can significantly reduce both the time
complexity and space complexity of algorithm In-Close4. Technically, the new
algorithm stores both context and extent of a concept as a vertical bit-array,
while within In-Close4 algorithm the context is stored only as a horizontal
bit-array, which is very slow in finding the intersection of two extent sets.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is much more
effective than In-Close4 algorithm, and it also has a broader scope of
applicability in computing formal concept in which one can solve the problems
that cannot be solved by the In-Close4 algorithm.

<p>This is a quick post to let people know that the 2021 <a href="https://q2b.qcware.com/">Q2B (Quantum 2 Business) conference</a> will be this December 7-9 at the Santa Clara Convention Center.  (Full disclosure: Q2B is hosted by <a href="https://qcware.com/">QC Ware, Inc.</a>, to which I’m the scientific adviser.)  Barring a dramatic rise in cases or the like, I’m planning to attend to do my Ask-Me-Anything session, in what’s become an annual tradition.  Notably, this will be my first in-person conference, and in fact my first professional travel of any kind, since before covid shut down the US in late March 2020.  I hope to see many of you there!  And if you <em>won’t</em> be at Q2B, but you’ll be in the Bay Area and would like to meet otherwise, let me know and we’ll try to work something out.</p></div>

I have been on many Math PhD thesis defense's  as the Dean's Representative. This means I don't have to understand the work, just make sure the rules are followed. I've done this for a while and I used to understand some of it but now there are times I understand literally none of it. As a result, when the student leaves the room and we talk among ourselves I ask<br />
<br />
<br />
When did Math get so hard?<br />
<br />
I mean it as a statement and maybe a joke, but I decided to email various people and ask for a serious answer. Here are some thoughts of mine and others<div><br /></div><div>1) When you get older math got harder. Lance blogged on this <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/10/a-young-persons-game.html">here</a></div><div><br /></div><div>2) When math got more abstract it got harder. Blame Grothendieck.</div><div><br /></div><div>3) When math stopped being tied to the real work it got harder. Blame Hardy. </div><div><br /></div><div>4) Math has always been hard. We NOW understand some of the older math better so it seems easy to us, but it wasn't at the time. </div><div><br /></div><div>5) With the web and more people working in math, new results come out faster so its harder to keep up.</div><div><br /></div><div>6) All fields of math have a period of time when they are easy, at the beginning, and then as the low-hanging fruit gets picked it gets harder and harder.  So if a NEW branch was started it might initially be easy. Counterthought- even a new branch might be hard now since it can draw on so much prior math. Also, the low hanging fruit may be picked rather quickly. </div><div><br />

As the name suggests, these are sets of integers no two of which differ by a square. My favorite such set consists of the losing positions in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtract_a_square">subtract-a-square</a>, where each move removes a square number of coins from a pile of coins, winning by taking the last coin. This general class of sets and the subtract-a-square set have \(o(n)\) elements up to \(n\), but their maximum density remains unknown.</p>

If so the faces would have to all be kites, per comments at the link. Which raises the question: can a convex polyhedron with congruent kite faces avoid being either a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezohedron">trapezohedron</a> or formed from deltahedron (a polyhedron with equilateral triangle faces) by subdividing each triangle into three kites?

<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>One of our students made a seminar presentation this week on the problem of covering
a given set of \(n\) points by two scaled and translated copies of a given convex <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(k\)-gon,</span> minimizing the scale factor, based on a 2016 conference paper on the problem published by someone else. The presentation was good but the paper turns out to be wrong in several ways. I think it should not be difficult to find the paper if you look, but I’m avoiding naming it here: it’s uncited, so it hasn’t done much damage to the literature, its author’s other papers are not as far as I know problematic, the author appears to want to forget the paper (there was no journal version and it is not included in their online publication list), and I want to focus on the geometric nature of the mistakes rather than on pointing fingers.</p>

<p>The algorithm of the paper starts by (correctly) computing the optimal cover of the given points by a single copy of the polygon. This is a low-dimensional linear program, but one with \(O(nk)\) constraints, one for each pair of a side of the polygon and an input point to be covered. The paper makes the observation that the only pairs that matter are the ones that match each side to the extreme point in a perpendicular direction, and it uses a nice divide-and-conquer method to find these extreme points in time \(O(n\log k)\), which turns out to be the bottleneck of the algorithm.</p>

<p>It then tries to use this one-copy cover to speed up the two-copy cover, and this is where things go wrong. It claims that if the one-copy cover has five or more of its sides touched by input points, then the optimal two-copy cover has the same scale factor: there are so many touching points that three or more of them would all have to be in the same copy of the two-copy cover, and would force it to have the same size as the one-copy cover. This is false.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/6fixture-can-shrink.svg" alt="Even when a regular hexagon is touched on six sides by the points that it covers, it may be possible to cover the same points by two smaller regular hexagons" /></p>

<p>It claims that, when four or fewer sides of the one-copy cover are touched by input points, then for the optimal two-copy cover, one of the two copies will be touched on two sides with the same slopes. If true this would greatly simplify the search for the optimal partition into two subsets and the optimal scale factor for that partition. But it is false: there exist instances where the slopes of sides touched on the two-copy cover are completely disjoint from the slopes touched on the one-copy cover.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/4fixture-can-shrink.svg" alt="Even when an octagon is touched on four sides by the points that it covers, the smallest two scaled and translated octagons that cover the same points may not be touched on any of the same sides" /></p>

<p>I think what is going on here is a more general phenomenon relating to linear programming, rather than to this specific geometric optimization problem. Suppose you have a linear program with \(k\) variables (here, three variables for the scale factor and translation vector of the single-copy cover), and to keep things simple let’s say that it has a unique optimal solution. That solution will be determined by a basis, a minimal subset of inequalities with the same solution. The basis inequalities become tight equalities rather than inequalities, and if you know which ones they are then you can just solve these \(k\) linear equations in the \(k\) unknowns. However, more than \(k\) inequalities may be  tight, and there may be more than one basis. With some additional assumptions that are automatically satisfied here you can choose any <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(k\)-tuple</span> of tight inequalities, solve linear equations, and get the same solution. But that does <em>not</em> mean that every <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(k\)-tuple</span> of tight inequalities is a basis, and it does not mean that these tight inequalities stay tight for all subsets of the constraints.</p>

<p>Turning this idea back into geometry, in each of these figures, the inequalities come from pairs of a point and a polygon side. Each inequality states that its point must be contained in the halfspace bounded by its side, and it is tight when the point lies on the side. Any translated and scaled copy of a polygon is determined by points that touch any three of its sides. But forming a basis, for the problem of covering points with the smallest possible copy, is a stronger property. A set of three sides and (maybe fewer than three) touching points forms a basis only when the normal vectors to those sides do not span an angle less <span style="white-space: nowrap;">than \(\pi\).</span></p>

<p>For instance, for the hexagons of the first illustration, triples of consecutive sides have normal vectors that span only an angle <span style="white-space: nowrap;">of \(2\pi/3\),</span> too small to form a basis. Other triples of sides have normal vectors that are more spread out and do form a basis. The blue one-copy hexagon containing all of the points is optimal, because all six of its sides are touched, and many triples of those touched sides are non-consecutive. But when we split the points into the two yellow hexagons, each yellow hexagon contains the points that touch only a consecutive triple of blue sides, not a basis. Because they are not a basis, those three points (and the other points that are grouped along with them) can be contained in a smaller hexagon than the blue one. (Exercise: find a basis for one of the yellow hexagons, showing that at least for this partition into two subsets the scale factor is optimal.)</p>

<p>We're in the midst of a great transformation in computing, one where data takes center stage and I predict this will start to have a larger effect on hiring in computer science departments. We'll see a bigger need to grow in data science, particularly machine learning and autonomous systems. Cybersecurity and quantum computing will also grow with a push due to competition with China. Quantum winter might be coming but we're not there yet.</p><p>Harder to predict is the rest of computer science, such as traditional areas like networks, operating systems, programming languages and, yes, theory, particularly theory unrelated to quantum, learning or security. There is still a need for CS departments to grow in these areas, but we may be moving away from a rising tide raising all boats. On the other hand due to the digital transformation of just about everything, non-CS departments are hiring people who look a lot like computer scientists.</p><p>Other factors may cause US universities to be more conservative in hiring such as a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/college-university-fall-higher-education-men-women-enrollment-admissions-back-to-school-11630948233?st=1oz46jkmsdq8jcq&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">drop in male students</a>, the upcoming <a href="https://www.cupahr.org/issue/feature/higher-ed-enrollment-cliff/">demographic cliff</a>, an unclear future for international students coming to the states, and a lingering COVID budget hangover.</p><p>So go get a job while the going is still good though I would not suggest forgoing a faculty position for a postdoc, particularly if you aren't working in data science.</p><p>I also wonder how the post-COVID world will affect the job search. We'll probably see more virtual interviews than the pre-COVID days at least in the early rounds. It's also harder for students to network and make themselves known at virtual and hybrid conferences which will likely persist for some time.</p><p>Give yourself a good virtual face. Have a well-designed web page with access to all your job materials and papers. Maintain your Google Scholar page. Add yourself to the CRA's <a href="https://cra.org/cv-database/">CV database</a>. Find a way to stand out, perhaps a short video describing your research. </p><p>Best source for finding jobs are the ads from the <a href="https://cra.org/ads/">CRA</a> and the <a href="https://jobs.acm.org/">ACM</a>.

If you have jobs to announce, please post to the above and/or feel free to leave a comment on this post. Even if you don't see an ad for a specific school they may still be hiring, check out their website or email someone at the department. You'll never know if you don't ask.</p></div>

<p>In many applications of machine learning, such as machine learning for medical diagnosis, we would like to have machine learning algorithms that do not memorize sensitive information about the training set, such as the specific medical histories of individual patients. Differential privacy is a notion that allows quantifying the degree of privacy protection provided by an algorithm on the underlying (sensitive) data set it operates on. Through the lens of differential privacy, we can design machine learning algorithms that responsibly train models on private data.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-need-private-machine-learning-algorithms">Why do we need private machine learning algorithms?</h2>

<p>Machine learning algorithms work by studying a lot of data and updating their parameters to encode the relationships in that data. Ideally, we would like the parameters of these machine learning models to encode general patterns (e.g., ‘‘patients who smoke are more likely to have heart disease’’) rather than facts about specific training examples (e.g., “Jane Smith has heart disease”). Unfortunately, machine learning algorithms do not learn to ignore these specifics by default. If we want to use machine learning to solve an important task, like making a cancer diagnosis model, then when we publish that machine learning model (for example, by making an open source cancer diagnosis model for doctors all over the world to use) we might also inadvertently reveal information about the training set. A malicious attacker might be able to inspect the published model’s predictions and learn private information about Jane Smith. For instance, the adversary could mount a membership inference attack to know whether or not Jane Smith contributed her data to the model’s training set [SSS17]. The adversary could also build on membership inference attacks to extract training data by repeatedly guessing possible training points until they result in a sufficiently strong membership signal from the model’s prediction [CTW20]. In many instances, the model itself may be represented by a few of the data samples (e.g., Support Vector Machine in its dual form).</p>

<p>A common misconception is that if a model generalizes (i.e., performs well on the test examples), then it preserves privacy. As mentioned earlier, this is far from being true. One of the main reasons being that generalization is an average case behavior of a model (over the distribution of data samples), whereas privacy must be provided for everyone, including outliers (which may deviate from our distributional assumptions).</p>

<p>Over the years, researchers have proposed various approaches towards protecting privacy in learning algorithms (k-anonymity [SS98], l-diversity [MKG07], m-invariance [XT07], t-closeness [LLV07] etc.). Unfortunately, [GKS08] all these approaches are vulnerable to what are called composition attacks, that use auxiliary information to violate the privacy protection. Famously, this strategy allowed researchers to de-anonymize part of a movie ratings dataset released to participants of the Netflix Prize when the individuals had also shared their movie ratings publicly on the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) [NS08]. If Jane Smith had assigned the same ratings to movies A, B and C in the Netflix Prize dataset and publicly on IMDb at similar times, then researchers could link data corresponding to Jane across both datasets. This would in turn give them the means to recover ratings that were included in the Netflix Prize but not on IMDb. This example shows how difficult it is to define and guarantee privacy because it is hard to estimate the scope of knowledge—about individuals—available to adversaries. While the dataset released by Netflix has since been taken down, it is difficult to ensure that all of its copies have been deleted. In recent years, data sample instance encoding based methods like InstaHide [HSL20], and NeuraCrypt [YEO21] have been demonstrated to be vulnerable to such composition attacks as well.</p>

<p>As a result, the research community has converged on differential privacy [DMNS06], which provides the following semantic guarantee, as opposed to ad-hoc approaches: An adversary learns almost the same information about an individual whether or not they are present in or absent from the training data set. In particular, it provides a condition on the algorithm, independent from who might be attacking it, or the specifics of the data set instantiation.  Put another way, differential privacy is a framework for evaluating the guarantees provided by a system that was designed to protect privacy. Such systems can be applied directly to “raw” data which potentially still contains sensitive information, altogether removing the need for procedures that sanitize or anonymize data and are prone to the failures described previously. That said, minimizing data collection in the first place remains a good practice to limit other forms of privacy risk.</p>

<h2 id="designing-private-machine-learning-algorithms-via-differential-privacy">Designing Private Machine Learning Algorithms via Differential Privacy</h2>

<p>Differential privacy [DMNS06] is a semantic notion of privacy that addresses a lot of the limitations of previous approaches like k-anonymity. The basic idea is to randomize part of the mechanism’s behavior to provide privacy. In our case, the mechanism considered is a learning algorithm, but the differential privacy framework can be applied to study any algorithm.</p>

<p>The intuition for why we introduce randomness into the learning algorithm is that it obscures the contribution of an individual, but does not obscure important statistical patterns. Without randomness, we would be able to ask questions like: “What parameters does the learning algorithm choose when we train it on this specific dataset?” With randomness in the learning algorithm, we instead ask questions like: “What is the probability that the learning algorithm will choose parameters in this set of possible parameters, when we train it on this specific dataset?”</p>

<p>We use a version of differential privacy which requires (in our use case of machine learning) that the probability of learning any particular set of parameters stays roughly the same if we change a single data record in the training set. A data record can be a single training example from an individual, or the collection of all the training examples provided by an individual. The former is often referred to as example level/item level privacy, and the latter is referred to as user level differential privacy. While user level privacy provides stronger semantics, it may be harder to achieve. For a more thorough discussion about the taxonomy of these notions, see [DNPR10, JTT18, HR12, HR13]. In this document, for the ease of exposition of the technical results, we focus on the example level notion. This could mean to add a training example, remove a training example, or change the values within one training example. The intuition is that if a single patient (Jane Smith) does not affect the outcome of learning much, then that patient’s records cannot be memorized and her privacy is respected. In the rest of this post, how much a single record can affect the outcome of learning is called the sensitivity of an algorithm.</p>

<p>The guarantee of differential privacy is that the adversary is not able to distinguish the answers produced by the randomized algorithm based on the data of two of the three users from the answers returned by the same algorithm based on the data of all three users. We also refer to the degree of indistinguishability as the privacy loss. Smaller privacy loss corresponds to a stronger privacy guarantee.</p>

<p>It is often thought that privacy is a fundamental bottleneck in obtaining good prediction accuracy/generalization for machine learning algorithms. In fact, recent research has shown that in many instances it actually helps in designing algorithms with strong generalization ability. Some of the examples where DP has resulted in designing better learning algorithms are Online linear predictions [KV05] and online PCA [DTTZ13]. Notably, [DFH15] formally showed that generalization for any DP learning algorithm comes for free. More concretely, if a DP learning algorithm has good training accuracy, it is guaranteed to have good test accuracy.
This is true because differential privacy itself acts as a very strong form of regularization.</p>

<p>One might argue that the generalization guarantee which a DP algorithm can achieve may be sub-par to that of its non-private baselines. For a large class of learning tasks, one can show that asymptotically DP does not introduce any further error beyond the inherent statistical error [SSTT21]. [ACG16,BFTT19] highlights that in the presence of enough data, a DP algorithm can get arbitrarily close to the inherent statistical error, even under strong privacy parameters.</p>

<h2 id="private-empirical-risk-minimization">Private Empirical Risk Minimization</h2>

<p>Before we go into the design of specific differentially private learning algorithms, we first formalize the problem setup, and standardize some notation. Consider a training data set \(D={(x_1,y_1),…,(x_n,y_n)}\) drawn i.i.d. from some fixed (unknown) distribution \(\Pi\), with the feature vector being \(x_i\) and label/response being \(y_i\). We define the training loss at any model \(\theta\) as \(L_{train} (\theta, D) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} l(\theta; (x_i, y_i))\), and the corresponding test loss as \(L_{test} (\theta) = E_{(x,y) \sim \Pi} l(\theta;(x,y)) \).
We will design DP algorithms to output models that approximately minimize the test loss while having access only to the training loss.</p>

<p>In the literature, there are a variety of approaches towards designing these DP learning algorithms [CMS11, KST12, BST14, PAE16, BTT18]. One can categorize them broadly as: i) algorithms that assume that the individual loss function \(l(\theta;\cdot) \) is convex in the model parameter  to ensure differential privacy, ii) algorithms that are differentially private even when the loss function is non-convex in nature (e.g., deep learning models), and iii) model agnostic algorithms, that do not require any information about the representation of the model \(\theta\), or the loss function \(l(\theta;\cdot) \). In our current discussion, we will only focus on designing algorithms for (ii), and (iii). This is because it turns out that the best known algorithms for (ii) are already competitive to algorithms that are specific for (i) [INS19].</p>

<h2 id="private-algorithms-for-training-deep-learning-models">Private Algorithms for Training Deep Learning Models</h2>

<p>The first approach, due to SCS13, BST14, and ACG16, is named differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). It proposes to modify the model updates computed by the most common optimizer used in deep learning: stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Typically, stochastic gradient descent trains iteratively. At each iteration, a small number of training examples (a “minibatch”) are sampled from the training set. The optimizer computes the average model error on these examples, and then differentiates this average error with respect to each of the model parameters to obtain a gradient vector. Finally, the model parameters (\(\theta_t\)) are updated by subtracting this gradient (\(\nabla_t\)) multiplied by a small constant \(\eta\) (the learning rate controls how quickly the optimizer updates the model’s parameters). At a high level, two modifications are made by DP-SGD to obtain differential privacy: gradients, which are computed on a per-example basis (rather than averaged over multiple examples), are first clipped to control their sensitivity, and, second, spherical Gaussian noise \(b_t\) is added to their sum to obtain the indistinguishability needed for DP. Succinctly, the update step can be written as follows: \(\theta_{t+1} \leftarrow \theta_t - \eta \cdot (\nabla_t + b_t)\).</p>

<p>Let us take the example of a hospital training a model to predict whether patients will be readmitted after being released. To train the model, the hospital uses information from patient records, such as demographic variables and admission variables (e.g., age, ethnicity, insurance type, type of Intensive Care Unit admitted to) but also time-varying vitals and labs (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, white blood cell counts) [JPS16]. The modifications made by DP-SGD ensure that if (1) Jane Smith’s individual patient record contained unusual features, e.g., her insurance provider was uncommon for people of her age or her heart rate followed an unusual pattern, the resulting signal will have a bounded impact on our model updates, and (2) the model’s final parameters would be essentially identical should Jane Smith have chosen to not contribute (i.e., opt-out) her patient record to the training set. Stronger differential privacy is achieved when one is able to introduce more noise (i.e., sample noise with larger standard deviation) and train for as few iterations as possible.</p>

<p>Two main components in the above DP-SGD algorithm that distinguishes itself from traditional SGD are: i) per-example clipping and ii) Gaussian noise addition. In addition, for the analysis to hold, DP-SGD requires that sub-sampling of mini batches is uniform at random from the training data set. While this is not a requirement of DP-SGD per se, in practice many implementations of SGD do not satisfy this requirement and instead analyze different permutations of the data at each epoch of training.</p>

<p>While gradient clipping is common in deep learning, often used as a form of regularization, it differs from that in DP-SGD as follows: The average gradient over the minibatch is clipped, as opposed to clipping the gradient of individual examples (i.e., \(l(\theta_t;(x,y)) \) before averaging. It is an ongoing research direction to both understand the effect of per-example clipping in DP-SGD in model training [SSTT21], and also effective ways to mitigate its impact both in terms of accuracy [PTS21], and training time [ZHS19].</p>

<p>In standard stochastic gradient descent, subsampling is usually used either as a way to speed up the training process [CAR16], or as a a form of regularization [RCR15]. In DP-SGD, the randomness in the subsampling of the minibatch is used to guarantee DP. The technical component for this sort of privacy analysis is called privacy amplification by subsampling [KLNRS08,BBG18]. Since the sampling randomness is used to guarantee DP, it is crucial that the uniformity in the sampling step is of cryptographic strength. Another, (possibly) counterintuitive feature of DP-SGD is that for best privacy/utility trade-off it is in general better to have larger batch sizes. In fact, full-batch DP-gradient descent may provide the best privacy/utility trade-offs, albeit at the expense of computational feasibility.</p>

<p>For a fixed DP guarantee, the magnitude of the Gaussian noise that gets added to the gradient updates in each step in DP-SGD is proportional to \(\sqrt{the\ number\ of\ steps}\) the model is trained for. As a result, it is important to tune the number of training steps for best privacy/utility trade-offs.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/privacy/blob/master/tutorials/mnist_dpsgd_tutorial.py">following tutorial</a>, we provide a small code snippet to train a model with DP-SGD.</p>

<h2 id="model-agnostic-private-learning">Model Agnostic Private Learning</h2>

<p>The Sample and Aggregate framework [NRS07] is a generic method to add differential privacy to a non-private algorithm without caring about the internal workings of it, a.k.a. model agnostic. In the context of machine learning, one can state the main idea as follows: Consider a multi-class classification problem. Take the training data, and split into k disjoint subsets of equal size. Train independent models \(\theta_1, \theta_2, …, \theta_k \) on the disjoint subsets. In order to predict on an test example x, first, compute a private histogram over the set of k predictions \(\theta_1(x), \theta_2(x), …, \theta_k(x) \). Then, select and output the bin in the histogram based on the highest count, after adding a small amount of Laplace/Gaussian noise to the counts. In the context of DP learning, this particular approach was used in two different lines of work: i) PATE [PAE16], and ii) Model agnostic private learning [BTT18]. While the latter focussed on obtaining theoretical privacy/utility trade-offs for a class of learning tasks (e.g., agnostic PAC learning), the PATE approach focuses on practical deployment. Both these lines of work make one common observation. If the predictions from \(\theta_1(x), \theta_2(x), …, \theta_k(x) \) are fairly consistent, then the privacy cost in terms of DP is very small. Hence, one can run a large number of prediction queries, without violating DP constraints. In the following, we describe the PATE approach in detail.</p>

<p>The private aggregation of teacher ensembles (PATE) demonstrated in particular that this approach allows one to learn deep neural networks with differential privacy. It proposes to have an ensemble of models trained without privacy predict with differential privacy by having these models predict in aggregate rather than revealing their individual predictions. In PATE, we start by partitioning the private dataset into smaller subsets of data. These subsets are partitions, so there is no overlap between the data included in any pair of partitions. If Jane Smith’s record was in our private dataset, then it is included in one of the partitions only. That is, only one of the teachers has analyzed Jane Smith’s record during training. We train a ML model, called a teacher, on each of these partitions. We now have an ensemble of teacher models that were trained independently, but without any guarantees of privacy. How do we use this ensemble to make predictions that respect privacy? In PATE, we add noise while aggregating the predictions made individually by each teacher to form a single common prediction. We count the number of teachers who voted for each class, and then perturb that count by adding random noise sampled from the Laplace or Gaussian distribution. Each label predicted by the noisy aggregation mechanism comes with rigorous differential privacy guarantees that bound the privacy budget spent to label that input. Again, stronger differential privacy is achieved when we are able to introduce more noise in the aggregation and are able to answer as few queries as possible. Let us now come back to our running example. Imagine that we’d like to use the output of PATE to know if Jane likes a particular movie. The only teacher trained on the partition containing Jane Smith’s data—has now learned that a record similar to Jane’s is characteristic of an individual who likes similar movies, and as a consequence changes its prediction on a test input which is similar to Jane’s to predict the movie rating assigned by Jane. However, because the teacher only contributes a single vote to the aggregation, and that the aggregation injects noise, we won’t be able to know whether the teacher changed its prediction to the movie rating assigned by Jane because the teacher indeed trained on Jane’s data or because the noise injected during the aggregation “flipped” that teacher’s vote. The random noise added to vote counts prevents the outcome of aggregation from reflecting the votes of any individual teachers to protect privacy.</p>

<h2 id="practically-deploying-differential-privacy-in-machine-learning">Practically deploying differential privacy in machine learning</h2>

<p>The two approaches we introduced have the advantage of being conceptually simple to understand. Fortunately, there also exist several open-source implementations of these approaches. For instance, DP-SGD is implemented in TensorFlow Privacy, Objax, and Opacus. This means that one is able to take an existing TensorFlow, JAX, or PyTorch pipeline for training a machine learning model and replace a non-private optimizer with DP-SGD. An example implementation of PATE is also available in TensorFlow Privacy. So what are the concrete potential obstacles to deploying machine learning with differential privacy?</p>

<p>The first obstacle is the accuracy of privacy-preserving models. Datasets are often sampled from distribution with heavy tails. For instance, in a medical application, there are typically (and fortunately) fewer patients with a given medical condition than patients without that condition. This means that there are fewer training examples for patients with each medical condition to learn from. Because differential privacy prevents us from learning patterns which are not found generally across the training data, it limits our ability to learn from these patients for which we have very few examples of [SPG]. More generally, there is often a trade-off between the accuracy of a model and the strength of the differential privacy guarantee it was trained with: the smaller the privacy budget is, the larger the impact on accuracy typically is. That said, this tension is not always inevitable and there are instances where privacy and accuracy are synergical because differential privacy implies generalization [DFH15] (but not vice versa).</p>

<p>The second obstacle to deploying differentially private machine learning can be the computational overhead. For instance, in DP-SGD one must compute per-example gradients rather than average gradients. This often means that optimizations implemented in machine learning frameworks to exploit matrix algebra supported by underlying hardware accelerators (e.g., GPUs) are harder to take advantage of. In another example, PATE requires that one train multiple models (the teachers) rather than a single model so this can also introduce overhead in the training procedure. Fortunately, this cost is mostly mitigated in recent implementations of private learning algorithms, in particular in Objax and Opacus.</p>

<p>The third obstacle to deploying differential privacy, in machine learning but more generally in any form of data analysis, is the choice of privacy budget. The smaller the budget, the stronger the guarantee is. This means one can compare two analyses and say which one is “more private”. However, this also means that it is unclear what is “small enough” of a privacy budget. This is particularly problematic given that applications of differential privacy to machine learning often require a privacy budget that provides little theoretical guarantees in order to train a model whose accuracy is large enough to warrant a useful deployment. Thus, it may be interesting for practitioners to evaluate the privacy of their machine learning algorithm by attacking it themselves. Whereas the theoretical analysis of an algorithm’s differential privacy guarantees provides a worst-case guarantee limiting how much private information the algorithm can leak against any adversary, implementing a specific attack can be useful to know how successful a particular adversary or class of adversaries would be. This helps interpret the theoretical guarantee but may not be treated as a direct substitute for it. Open-source implementations of such attacks are increasingly available: e.g., for membership inference <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/privacy/tree/master/tensorflow_privacy/privacy/privacy_tests/membership_inference_attack">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cchoquette/membership-inference">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In the above, we discussed some of the algorithmic approaches towards differentially private model training which have been effective both in theoretical and practical settings. Since it is a rapidly growing field, we could not cover all the important aspects of the research space. Some prominent ones include: i) Choice of the best hyperparameters in the training of DP models.In order to ensure that the overall algorithm preserves differential privacy, one needs to ensure that the choice of hyperparameters itself preserves DP. Recent research has provided algorithms for selecting the best hyperparameters in a differentially private fashion [LT19]. ii) Choice of network architecture: it is not always true that the best known model architectures for non-private model training are indeed the best for training with differential privacy. In particular, we know that the number of model parameters may have adverse effects on the privacy/utility trade-offs [BST14]. Hence, choosing the right model architecture is important for providing a good privacy/utility trade-off [PTS21]. (iii) Training in the federated/distributed setting: in the above exposition, we assumed that the training data lies in a single centralized location. However, in settings like Federated Learning (FL) [MMRHA17], the data records can be highly distributed, e.g., across various mobile devices. Running DP-SGD in the FL setting, which is required for FL to provide privacy guarantees for the training data, raises a series of challenges [KMA19] which are often facilitated by distributed private learning algorithms designed specifically for FL settings [BKMTT20, KMSTTZ21]. Some of the specific challenges in the context of FL include, limited and non-uniform availability of clients (holding individual data records) and unknown (and variable) size of the training data [BKMTT18]. On the other hand, PATE style algorithms lend themselves naturally to the distributed setting once combined with existing cryptographic primitives, as demonstrated by the CaPC protocol [CDD21]. It is an active area of research to address these above challenges.</p>

<p>In this post, we'll look at the natural problem of how to communicate an estimate of a real value in [0,1], using just 1 bit.  The post is based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02331" target="_blank">this paper</a> (by Ran Ben-Basat of UCL and Shay Vargaftik of VMware Research and myself -- they helped also with the post) that appeared in ICALP last year. </p><p>This question is motivated by various aggregation problems;  multiple sending devices may measure a value, and wish to send the value to an aggregator who will compute something from the received values, such as the average.  In our problem, the senders have a real value x in [0,1] to send, but are constrained to send just a single bit.  Variations of this problem have come up in recent work on distributed/federated learning, where clients compute a gradient vector and send it to a centralized parameter server to update a learning model;  we may want to compress the vector to a small number of bits, or even 1 bit, per coordinate.  (We'll have more to say on the federated learning problem in a future post.)  Of course, it's also just an interesting randomized algorithm problem that seems interesting in its own right.  </p><p>A natural way to look at the problem is as a variation on rounding.  Given a value x in [0,1], one natural approach if limited to one bit is to deterministically round it to X.  But what should the receiver do when they receive the (rounded) bit value X?  It depends on what one's optimization goal is, but to minimize the maximum possible error, the receiver should have their estimate x' take on the value 3/4 when X is 1, 1/4 otherwise.  Note though that deterministic rounding this way is biased -- the expectation E[x'] does not equal x.  Randomized rounding, where the sender sends 1 with probability x and 0 otherwise, and the receiver uses the received bit X as the estimate x', has the property that E[x'] = x.  Unbiased estimators are arguably more natural for many estimation problems.  Here the measure of performance would be the maximum variance for the estimate over all inputs x, so for randomized rounding the cost is 1/4 (when x = 1/2).  </p><p>Can one do better than these schemes?  It turns out that you can, if you have available shared randomness.  An approach that has been known in the engineering world (where it has been used in signal processing) is subtractive dithering:  </p><p>We assume that the sender and receiver have access to shared randomness ℎ∼𝑈[−1/2,1/2].  Given a value x, the sender sends 1 if x+h≥1/2, 0 otherwise.  The receiver estimates x' = X - h.  We leave as an exercise that this is unbiased, which can be shown by deriving the stronger fact that x' is distributed as 𝑈[𝑥−1/2,𝑥+1/2] , and thus Var[𝑥']=1/12.</p><p>Subtractive dithering ignores that generating a shared real number may be more costly or problematic than generating a finite number of shared bits.  So one of the results of our paper is developing a "finite shared random bits" unbiased estimator, that corresponds to randomized rounding with no shared bits and converges to subtractive dithering as the number of shared random bits goes to infinity.  (The approach does allow for generating a private random real value.)  </p><p>Also in our paper, we study biased schemes, aiming to minimize the worst-case expected mean-squared error (where the expectation is over randomness used in the algorithm).  For example, it's very odd in the setting of subtractive dithering that one can obtain estimates smaller than 0 or greater than 1, when the input is restricted to [0,1], but that's a price we pay for having an unbiased estimator.  For  a biased estimator, you might naturally truncate the result from subtractive dithering;  by truncating to [z,1-z] for an appropriate z &gt; 0, you can indeed slightly improve over the worst-case mean-squared error of 1/16 for deterministic rounding.</p><p>We then studied various algorithmic improvements to obtain better biased schemes.  We were able to progress by looking at limited shared randomness, namely finding the best algorithm with s shared bits.  For example, consider the case of just 1 shared random bit h in {0,1}.  The receiver receives 1 bit X from the sender, and thus can have four possible estimates x' depending on X and h.  If the 4 possible estimate values are v0, v1, v2, v3 (all between 0 and 1), then it is possible to show the largest possible expected squared error occurs at one of the five inputs 0, 1, (v0+v1)/2, (v1+v2)/2, (v2+v3)/2.   We can then write a quadratic program to find the values that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error.  The end result is the following rounding algorithm:  given 1 shared random bit h in {0,1} and the value x, let X = 1 if x ≥ 0.4 + 0.2h, and 0 otherwise;  then let the estimate x' = 0.1 + 0.2h + 0.6X.  This has a worst-case expected mean-squared error of 1/20, beating deterministic rounding and truncated subtractive dithering.  Using some additional arguments we can handle more shared random bits;  at 8 bits we improve the worst-case expected squared error to about 0.04599, which is quite close to our lower bound of about 0.0459, and this is better than anything we could come up with analytically.  The optimal solution is still not known (an open question for future work!).  </p><p>Overall there are many variants of the rounding problem, and few tight bounds currently.  So even for simple-seeming problems like rounding, there are still interesting things to do.  </p></div>

<p>The other day I couldn’t remember Fibonacci’s original motivation/presentation of the sequence now famously named after him.  This had to be corrected immediately, because of the picture above and my <a href="https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/viola/papers/amigaMagazine.pdf">first publication</a> (1994) which includes a simple algorithm to decompress sounds.  The compression algorithm works by storing rather than the sound data — think of it as the key — the difference between consecutive keys.  The saving comes from not allowing every possible difference, but only those in… the Fibonacci sequence.  Why those differences are the right ones is part of the mystique which makes studying the sequence fun.  For further technical but not mystical details see the paper; an implementation of the decompressor is given in the Motorola 68000 assembly code.</p>



<p>This is me on my way to Fibonacci from Rome, some years ago:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://emanueleviola.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/dsc01563-1.jpg"><img src="https://emanueleviola.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/dsc01563-1.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-947" /></a></figure>



<p>I actually find some presentations of the sequence a little hard to grasp, so I came up with a trivially different rendering which now will make it impossible for me to forget:</p>



<p>There are two types of trees: Young and old.  You start with one young tree. In one period, a young tree produces another young tree and becomes old, and an old tree produces a young tree and dies. How many young trees are there after t periods?</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Period</td><td>Young trees</td><td>Old trees</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>5</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>I also couldn’t exactly remember the spiral you can make with these numbers.  But you can tile the plane with squares whose sides come from the sequence, if you arrange them in a spiral.</p></div>

<div class="content">
<p>The problem of <i>squaring the circle</i>: Given a circle, construct (with straightedge and compass) a square with the same area. While browsing the web for more information on this problem (for the blog entry on problems that might be similar to P vs NP: <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/10/is-math-ready-for-pnp-is-alexandra.html">here</a>)  I came across the following:</p><p>In the Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera <i>Princess Ida</i>, in the song <i>Gently, Gently</i>  is the line:</p><p>                                <i>    ... and the circle they will square it one fine day.</i></p><p>(To hear the song see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r2hEcDmeIY">here</a>. The line is towards the end.) </p><p>They lyrics are <a href="https://www.gsarchive.net/princess_ida/webop/pi_12.html">here</a>. That website begins  <i>gsarchive.ne</i>t which made me wonder<i> Did I at one time set</i> u<i>p a website of math refs in Gilbert and Sullivan plays (gsarch is very close to gasarch) ? </i>which IS the kind of thing I would do. The answer is no: <i> gsarch</i> stands for <i>Gilbert and Sullivan archive.</i> They could have called it <i>gasarch </i>if they used the <i>and </i>in <i>Gilbert and Sullivan</i> but abbreviated <i>archive </i>as arch. Then I would have been far more confused. </p><p>Moving on...</p><p>In 1884<i> Princess Ida</i> opened in 1884. For more on this comic opera see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Ida">here</a>.</p><p>In 1882 pi was proven  transcendental and hence one cannot square the circle. For more on pi being transcendental see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring_the_circle">here</a>.</p><p>Kolmogorov Random Thoughts on all of this</p><p>0) The song is sung my three men who are making fun of the notion of a women's college. The song is about all the things the women are trying to do that are absurd such as squaring the circle. They also mention perpetual motion machines. </p><p>1) Did G and S know that the squaring the circle had been proven impossible, or just that it was thought to be impossible, or just that it was thought to be hard?</p><p>2) Was it known that perpetual motion machines were impossible? Or just very hard? </p><p>3) G and S used Mathematics in at least one other song: <i> I am the very model of a modern major general, </i>from<i> The Pirates of Penzance  </i>has the lines:</p><p><br /></p><p>                                       <i>I'm very well acquainted too with matters mathematical</i></p><p><i>                                       I understand equations, both the simple and quadratical,</i></p><p><i>                                       About binomial theorems I'm teeming with the a lot o' news---</i></p><p><i>                                       With many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse</i></p><p><br /></p><p>and later </p><p><i>                                        I'm very good at integral and differential calculus</i></p><p>See <a href="https://naic.edu/~gibson/poems/gilbert1.html">here</a> for all the lyrics. The website mentioned in the next point has a pointer to a YouTube video of people singing it. </p><p>4) There are many parodies of <i>Modern Major General. </i>The earliest ones I know of is Tom Lehrer's  <i>The Elements. </i>Since making a website of them IS the kind of thing I would do,  while writing this post I did it (Are we compelled to do things that fit our image of ourselves? Yup.) The website is <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/FUN//modmajgen.html">here</a>. It has 36 parodies (as of Oct 17, 2021 when I wrote this blog--- it may have more if you read this later.) That may seem like a lot, but it pales in comparison  to the most satirized song of all time: <i>The 12 days of Christmas </i>which I did an ugly lyrics-only website for back before html had nice tools, see <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/12days.html">here</a>. It has 143 songs on it but I am sure there are many more. (Note to self: redo that website when you have time. Maybe when I retire.) </p><p>4) I suspect that G and S knew more math, or perhaps knew of more math,  than Broadway composers know now. I suspect this is a more general trend: people are more specialized now. Having said that, I need to mention the off-Broadway musical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Tango">Fermat's last Tango</a> which I liked more than Lance (see his post on it <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2004/02/fermats-last-tango.html">here</a>). </p><p>5) How much math would you need to know in order to insert some into your play or movie? With Wikipedia and other web sources you could find out some things, but you would have to have some idea what you are looking for. And perhaps you would need some math background in order to even want to insert some math into your work in the first place. </p><p>6)  Here's hoping someone will make a musical about William Rowan Hamilton using this song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZXHoWwBcDc">here</a> as a starting point. I blogged rather optimistically about that possibility <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/04/william-rowan-hamilton-musical.html#comment-form">here</a>.</p><p><br /></p></div>

<p>Over the past year or so I’ve been working with Marc van Kreveld and Wolfgang Mulzer to set up a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_open_access">diamond open access</a> computational geometry journal, <em><a href="https://www.cgt-journal.org/index.php/cgt">Computing in Geometry and Topology</a></em>, sponsored by the <a href="https://www.computational-geometry.org/">Society for Computational Geometry</a>, the organization set up to run the annual <em>Symposium on Computational Geometry</em>. It is the second such journal to be established, after the <em><a href="https://jocg.org/index.php/jocg">Journal of Computational Geometry</a></em>. This week the new journal went live and it is now available for submissions. Below is the official announcement we sent out to several mailing lists:</p>

<hr />

<p>Dear all,</p>

<p>As of this week, the new diamond open access journal</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Computing in Geometry and Topology</em></p>

<p>is welcoming submissions. The website of the journal is <a href="https://www.cgt-journal.org/index.php/cgt">https://www.cgt-journal.org/index.php/cgt</a></p>

<p>Here you can also find the editorial board, the submission guidelines, the scope, and a style file.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about the journal, please send them to info@cgt-journal.org</p>

<p>Best regards,
David Eppstein, Marc van Kreveld, and Wolfgang Mulzer</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Purpose and scope</strong></p>

<p><em>Computing in Geometry and Topology</em> aims to support the broader computational geometry and topology community by being a peer-reviewed scientific journal that provides diamond open access. <em>Computing in Geometry and Topology</em> is sponsored by the Society for Computational Geometry.</p>

<p>With the broader computational geometry and topology community, we include researchers in discrete and combinatorial geometry, and any application area of computational geometry and topology. We also include algorithm engineering for geometric computations.</p>

<p>The journal publishes two types of papers. Firstly, the journal publishes original research of sufficient depth and interest. Secondly, the journal publishes high-quality survey papers. Every paper has been thoroughly reviewed by experts in the area.</p>

<p>To emphasize the breadth of the interpretation of computational geometry and topology, the editorial board has different sections that represent the algorithmic and mathematical aspects, the applied aspects, and the engineering aspects.</p>

We consider the problem of extracting randomness from \textit{sumset sources}, a general class of weak sources introduced by Chattopadhyay and Li (STOC, 2016). An $(n,k,C)$-sumset source $\mathbf{X}$ is a distribution on $\{0,1\}^n$ of the form $\mathbf{X}_1 + \mathbf{X}_2 + \ldots + \mathbf{X}_C$, where $\mathbf{X}_i$'s are independent sources on $n$ bits with min-entropy at least $k$. Prior extractors either required the number of sources $C$ to be a large constant or the min-entropy $k$ to be at least $0.51 n$. 

As our main result, we construct an explicit extractor for sumset sources in the setting of $C=2$ for min-entropy $\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$ and polynomially small error. We can further improve the min-entropy requirement  to $(\log n) \cdot (\log \log n)^{1 + o(1)}$ at the expense of worse error parameter of our extractor. We find applications of our sumset extractor for extracting randomness from other well-studied models of weak sources such as affine sources, small-space sources,  and interleaved sources.</div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: Based on the recent breakthrough of Huang (2019), we show that for any total Boolean function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" />,</p>
<ul>
<li>The degree of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> is at most quadratic in the approximate degree of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" />. This is optimal as witnessed by the OR function.</li>
<li>The deterministic query complexity of f is at most quartic in the quantum query complexity of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" />. This matches the known separation (up to log factors) due to Ambainis, Balodis, Belovs, Lee, Santha, and Smotrovs (2017).</li>
</ul>
<p>We apply these results to resolve the quantum analogue of the Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture. We show that if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> is a nontrivial monotone graph property of an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" />-vertex graph specified by its adjacency matrix, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q%28f%29%3D%5COmega%28n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Q(f)=\Omega(n)" class="latex" />, which is also optimal. We also show that the approximate degree of any read-once formula on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> variables is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CTheta%28%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\Theta(\sqrt{n})" class="latex" />.</p>

Robert Tarjan is well known to most—a Turing award winner in 1986 with <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/tarjan_1092048.cfm">John Hopcroft</a>. Bob is a professor of Computer Science at Princeton University, and one of the world experts on linear time graph algorithms. I always thought if some NP-complete graph problem had a linear time algorithm, then P=NP would have long been solved by Bob. </p>
<p>
Today we talk about a problem that hasn’t been solved by Bob.<br />
<span id="more-19240"></span></p>
<p>
The problem I mean was <em>quasi-</em>solved by Bob. That is, he gave a quasi-polynomial time algorithm. The problem is <em>group isomorphism</em> (GpI). Laci Babai discusses its relation as a special case of <em>graph isomorphism</em> (GI) in section 13.2 of his famous 2016 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03547.pdf">paper</a> giving a quasi-polynomial time algorithm for GI. He says that the annoyance of GpI should temper expectations for getting GI into polynomial time, because:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> [I]n spite of considerable effort and the availability of powerful algebraic machinery, Group Isomorphism is still not known to be in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" />. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Bob’s Least Result </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Bob has many great and deep results. For example, Donald Knuth <a href="https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2213858">described</a> Bob’s strong connected component algorithm for directed graphs in these words:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The data structures that he devised for this problem fit together in an amazingly beautiful way, so that the quantities you need to look at while exploring a directed graph are always magically at your fingertips. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Here is Ken’s slight editing of Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm">presentation</a>:</p>
<p><code><br />

<p></p><h2> The Annoying Problem </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Just over ten years ago we talked about: How do we tell if two groups are isomorphic? Precisely on October 8, 2011 we talked about <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/10/08/an-annoying-open-problem/">group isomorphism</a>. We called it an annoying problem. It remains annoying. </p>
<p>
In the group isomorphism problem (GpI), we are given two finite groups <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" /> of order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> in terms of their multiplication tables and must decide if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG+%5Ccong+H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G \cong H}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>
Bob Tarjan famously noted that this could be done <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7B%5Clog_2+n+%2B+O%281%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n^{\log_2 n + O(1)}}" class="latex" /> time. He never published this result and just orally told others about it. The insight was that every group of order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> had a generator set of size at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog_2+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\log_2 n}" class="latex" />. Since his insight the group isomorphism problem remains roughly the same complexity. The best is the <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2013/05/11/advances-on-group-isomorphism/">improvement</a> due to David Rosenbaum. His algorithm is still of order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7Bc+%5Clog+n%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n^{c \log n}}" class="latex" />. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.3935.pdf">here</a> for details. </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> General group isomorphism is in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7B%281%2F2%29+log_p+n%2BO%281%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n^{(1/2) log_p n+O(1)}}" class="latex" /> deterministic time where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{p}" class="latex" /> is the smallest prime dividing the order of the group. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Better than Bob’s insight, but still not polynomial time. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Order Restriction </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The results to date on GpI have relied mainly on basic group theory. Bob’s result uses an elementary fact about finite groups. David uses the same insight and adds a deep fact about isomorphism type problems. Neither use any of the “millions” of theorems known about finite groups. </p>
<p>
I wondered if there is some hope to start to exploit more of the papers on group structure? The trouble I think is that these results are quite difficult for those not in group theory to understand. But perhaps there is some hope. What do you think?</p>
<p>
I still wonder if there is a polynomial time algorithm for the general group isomorphism problem? Can we eliminate the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\log n}" class="latex" /> exponent somehow? This lead us to note the following simple theorem:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 2</b> <em> Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" /> be finite groups of order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> that is square free.Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG+%5Ccong+H%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G \cong H}" class="latex" /> can be determined in time polynomial in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> time. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
That is, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> has no prime <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{p}" class="latex" /> so that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{p^2}" class="latex" /> divides <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> But Wait… </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
As I worked on this I found a nice <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08872.pdf">paper</a> by Heiko Dietrich and James Wilson, titled “Polynomial Time Isomorphism Tests Of Black-Box Type Groups Of Most Orders.” They reference another <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03467.pdf">paper</a> that proved a stronger theorem than our above one:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 3</b> <em> There is an algorithm that given groups <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" /> of permutations on finitely many points, decides whether they are of cube-free order, and if so, decides that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG+%5Ccong+H%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G \cong H}" class="latex" /> or constructs an isomorphism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG+%5Crightarrow+H%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G \rightarrow H}" class="latex" />. The algorithm runs in time polynomial in the input size. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Proof of Our Theorem </h2><p></p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><p><b>Definition 4</b> <em> A finite group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> is <b>metacyclic</b> provided it has a normal subgroup <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N}" class="latex" /> so that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%2FN%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G/N}" class="latex" /> are both cyclic. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Every finite group of square-free order (i.e. the order is not divisible by the square of a natural number) is metacyclic.</p>
<p>
<em>Proof:</em>  We claim that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" /> are both metacyclic. This follows from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacyclic_group">fact</a> that their order is square free. But then we know that both <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" /> are generated by at most two elements—see <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1734406/prove-metacyclic-group-is-generated-by-two-elements">this</a>. This yields an isomorphism algorithm based on the above generator trick. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CBox&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\Box" class="latex" /></p>
<p>
Their stronger proof uses quite a bit more group theory. But our simple proof may give you some intuition why the restriction on the order of the group helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p>
The above result fits well with the belief that the worst case for isomorphism is when the order of the groups is a power of a prime. Some possible conjectures are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Can we generalize “<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> is square free” to “<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5E4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{p^4}" class="latex" /> does not divide <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />“? Or to “<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5E%7B5%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{p^{5}}" class="latex" /> does not divide <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />?” And so on? <p></p>
</li><li>
Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%28G%29%3D1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Z(G)=1}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7CAut%28G%29%7C+%5Cle+%7CG%7C%5E%7BO%281%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{|Aut(G)| \le |G|^{O(1)}}" class="latex" />.
