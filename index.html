whether we can transform $G$ into a union of vertex-disjoint cliques by at most
$k$ modifications (edge deletions or insertions). In this paper, we study the
following variant of Cluster Editing. We are given a graph $G=(V,E)$, a packing
$\mathcal{H}$ of modification-disjoint induced $P_3$s (no pair of $P_3$s in
$\cal H$ share an edge or non-edge) and an integer $\ell$. The task is to
decide whether $G$ can be transformed into a union of vertex-disjoint cliques
by at most $\ell+|\cal H|$ modifications (edge deletions or insertions). We
show that this problem is NP-hard even when $\ell=0$ (in which case the problem
asks to turn $G$ into a disjoint union of cliques by performing exactly one
edge deletion or insertion per element of $\cal H$). This answers negatively a
question of van Bevern, Froese, and Komusiewicz (CSR 2016, ToCS 2018), repeated
by Komusiewicz at Shonan meeting no. 144 in March 2019.

and in applications, there has been increasing interest in using tools from
this field with methods for machine learning. Using persistent homology,
specifically persistence diagrams, as inputs to machine learning techniques
requires some mathematical creativity. The space of persistence diagrams does
not have the desirable properties for machine learning, thus methods such as
kernel methods and vectorization methods have been developed. One such
featurization of persistence diagrams by Perea, Munch and Khasawneh uses
continuous, compactly supported functions, referred to as "template functions,"
which results in a stable vector representation of the persistence diagram. In
this paper, we provide a method of adaptively partitioning persistence diagrams
to improve these featurizations based on localized information in the diagrams.
Additionally, we provide a framework to adaptively select parameters required
for the template functions in order to best utilize the partitioning method. We
present results for application to example data sets comparing classification
results between template function featurizations with and without partitioning,
in addition to other methods from the literature.

decision trees or branching programs - deterministic and nondeterministic. The
systems LDT and LNDT are propositional proof systems in which lines represent
deterministic or non-deterministic decision trees. Branching programs are
modeled as decision dags. Adding extension to LDT and LNDT gives systems eLDT
and eLNDT in which lines represent deterministic and non-deterministic
branching programs, respectively.

<p>Deterministic and non-deterministic branching programs correspond to
log-space (L) and nondeterministic log-space (NL). Thus the systems eLDT and
eLNDT are propositional proof systems that reason with (nonuniform) L and NL
properties.

<p>The main results of the paper are simulation and non-simulation results for
tree-like and dag-like proofs in the systems LDT, LNDT, eLDT, and eLNDT. These

large graphs. While extracting small representative subgraphs from large
graphs, the challenge is to capture the properties of the original graph.
Several sampling algorithms have been proposed in previous studies, but they
lack in extracting good samples. In this paper, we propose a new sampling
method called Weighted Edge Sampling. In this method, we give equal weight to
all the edges in the beginning. During the sampling process, we sample an edge
with the probability proportional to its weight. When an edge is sampled, we
increase the weight of its neighboring edges and this increases their
probability to be sampled. Our method extracts the neighborhood of a sampled
edge more efficiently than previous approaches. We evaluate the efficacy of our
sampling approach empirically using several real-world data sets and compare it
with some of the previous approaches. We find that our method produces samples
that better match the original graphs. We also calculate the Root Mean Square
Error and Kolmogorov Smirnov distance to compare the results quantitatively.

constraints, and constraint matrix $A$, computes an $\epsilon$-approximate
solution in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{rank(A)}\log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations with high
probability. Each iteration of our method consists of solving $\tilde{O}(1)$
linear systems and additional nearly linear time computation, improving by a
factor of $\tilde{\Omega}((m/rank(A))^{1/2})$ over the previous fastest method
with this iteration cost due to Renegar (1988). Further, we provide a
deterministic polynomial time computable $\tilde{O}(rank(A))$-self-concordant
barrier function for the polytope, resolving an open question of Nesterov and
Nemirovski (1994) on the theory of "universal barriers" for interior point
methods.
</p>
<p>Applying our techniques to the linear program formulation of maximum flow
yields an $\tilde{O}(|E|\sqrt{|V|}\log(U))$ time algorithm for solving the
maximum flow problem on directed graphs with $|E|$ edges, $|V|$ vertices, and
integer capacities of size at most $U$. This improves upon the previous fastest
polynomial running time of
$O(|E|\min\{|E|^{1/2},|V|^{2/3}\}\log(|V|^{2}/|E|)\log(U))$ achieved by
Goldberg and Rao (1998). In the special case of solving dense directed unit
capacity graphs our algorithm improves upon the previous fastest running times
of $O(|E|\min\{|E|^{1/2},|V|^{2/3}\})$ achieved by Even and Tarjan (1975) and
Karzanov (1973) and of $\tilde{O}(|E|^{10/7})$ achieved more recently by
M\k{a}dry (2013).

compute a partition of its vertices into two subsets of roughly equal volume,
while minimizing the number of edges connecting the subsets. We present the
first deterministic, almost-linear time approximation algorithm for this
problem. Our algorithm in fact provides a stronger guarantee: it either returns
a balanced cut whose value is close to a given target value, or it certifies
that such a cut does not exist by exhibiting a large subgraph of $G$ that has
high conductance. We use this algorithm to obtain deterministic algorithms for
dynamic connectivity and minimum spanning forest, whose worse-case update time
on an $n$-vertex graph is $n^{o(1)}$, thus resolving a major open problem in
the area of dynamic graph algorithms. Our work also implies deterministic
algorithms for a host of additional problems, whose time complexities match, up
to subpolynomial in $n$ factors, those of known randomized algorithms. The
implications include almost-linear time deterministic algorithms for solving
Laplacian systems and for approximating maximum flows in undirected graphs.

capture the geometry surfaces accurately in two and three dimensions. Several
benchmark problems are solved to demonstrate the accuracy of the new algorithm.
The algorithm is open source and our manuscript is fully reproducible.

organisms. Popular phylogenetic reconstruction approaches typically yield
hundreds to thousands of trees on a common leafset. Storing and sharing such
large collection of trees requires considerable amount of space and bandwidth.
Furthermore, the huge size of phylogenetic tree databases can make search and
retrieval operations time-consuming. Phylogenetic compression techniques are
specialized compression techniques that exploit redundant topological
information to achieve better compression of phylogenetic trees. Here, we
present EvoZip, a new approach for phylogenetic tree compression. On average,
EvoZip achieves 71.6% better compression and takes 80.71% less compression time
and 60.47% less decompression time than TreeZip, the current state-of-the-art
algorithm for phylogenetic tree compression. While EvoZip is based on TreeZip,
it betters TreeZip due to (a) an improved bipartition and support list encoding
scheme, (b) use of Deflate compression algorithm, and (c) use of an efficient
tree reconstruction algorithm. EvoZip is freely available online for use by the
scientific community.

overall map quality. Most previous work focused on designing and implementing
fully automatic solutions, but the resulting visual and aesthetic quality has
not reached the same level of sophistication that skilled human cartographers
achieve. We investigate a different strategy that combines the strengths of
humans and algorithms. In our proposed method, first an initial labeling is
computed that has many well-placed labels but is not claiming to be perfect.
Instead it serves as a starting point for an expert user who can then
interactively and locally modify the labeling where necessary. In an iterative
human-in-the-loop process alternating between user modifications and local
algorithmic updates and refinements the labeling can be tuned to the user's
needs. We demonstrate our approach by performing different possible
modification steps in a sample workflow with a prototypical interactive
labeling editor. Further, we report computational performance results from a
simulation experiment in QGIS, which investigates the differences between exact
and heuristic algorithms for semi-automatic map labeling. To that end, we
compare several alternatives for recomputing the labeling after local
modifications and updates, as a major ingredient for an interactive labeling
editor.

structure designed to perform more efficient set reconciliations in distributed
systems. It guarantees eventual consistency of states between nodes in a
system, while still keeping bloom filter sizes as compact as possible. The
eventuality can be tweaked as desired, by tweaking the distributed bloom
filter's parameters. The scalability, as well as accuracy of the data structure
is made possible by combining two novel ideas: The first idea introduces a new,
computationally inexpensive way for populating bloom filters, making it
possible to quickly compute new bloom filters when interacting with peers. The
second idea introduces the concept of unique bloom filter mappings between
peers. By applying these two simple ideas, one can achieve incredibly
bandwidth-efficient set reconciliation in networks. Instead of trying to
minimize the false positive rate of a single bloom filter, we use the unique
bloom filter mappings to increase the probability for an element to propagate
through a network. We compare the standard bloom filter with the distributed
bloom filter and show that even with a false positive rate of 50%, i.e. even
with a very small bloom filter size, the distributed bloom filter still manages
to reach complete set reconciliation across the network in a highly
space-efficient, as well as time-efficient way.

and minor-closed families of graphs. The input consists of a node-weighted
undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ and integer connectivity requirements $r(uv)$ for
each unordered pair of nodes $uv$. The goal is to find a minimum weighted
subgraph $H$ of $G$ such that $H$ contains $r(uv)$ disjoint paths between $u$
and $v$ for each node pair $uv$. Three versions of the problem are
edge-connectivity SNDP (EC-SNDP), element-connectivity SNDP (Elem-SNDP) and
vertex-connectivity SNDP (VC-SNDP) depending on whether the paths are required
to be edge, element or vertex disjoint respectively. Our main result is an
$O(k)$-approximation algorithm for EC-SNDP and Elem-SNDP when the input graph
is planar or more generally if it belongs to a proper minor-closed family of
graphs; here $k=\max_{uv} r(uv)$ is the maximum connectivity requirement. This
improves upon the $O(k \log n)$-approximation known for node-weighted EC-SNDP
and Elem-SNDP in general graphs [Nutov, TALG'12]. We also obtain an $O(1)$
approximation for node-weighted VC-SNDP when the connectivity requirements are
in $\{0,1,2\}$; for higher connectivity our result for Elem-SNDP can be used in
a black-box fashion to obtain a logarithmic factor improvement over currently
known general graph results. Our results are inspired by, and generalize, the
work of [Demaine, Hajiaghayi and Klein, TALG'14] who obtained constant factor
approximations for node-weighted Steiner tree and Steiner forest problems in
planar graphs and proper minor-closed families of graphs via a primal-dual
algorithm.

objects, where comparability of two entities is implicitly defined but can be
efficiently tested. Computing the largest anti-chain in a poset can be done in
polynomial time via maximum-matching in a bipartite graph, and this leads to
several efficient algorithms for the following problems, each running in
(roughly) $O(n^{3/2})$ time: (A) Computing the largest Pareto-optimal subset of
a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$. (B) Given a set of disks in the plane,
computing the largest subset of disks such that no disk contains another. This
is quite surprising, as the independent version of this problem is
computationally hard. (C) Given a set of axis-aligned rectangles, computing the

problem for a set of probability measures with finite support. In this paper,
we show that finding a barycenter of sparse support is hard, even in dimension
2 and for only 3 measures.
</p>
<p>We prove this claim by showing that a special case of an intimately related
decision problem SCMP - does there exist a measure with a non-mass-splitting
transport cost and support size below prescribed bounds? - is NP-hard for all
rational data. Our proof is based on a reduction from planar 3-dimensional
matching and follows a strategy laid out by Spieksma and Woeginger for a
reduction to planar, minimum circumference 3-dimensional matching. While we
closely mirror the actual steps of their proof, the arguments themselves differ
fundamentally due to the complex nature of the discrete barycenter problem.
</p>
<p>Second, we prove that given a rational measure, an optimal transport to a set
of measures can be computed in polynomial time. However, the complexity of this
task depends on the size of an encoding of this measure, not only on the input
size to the underlying barycenter problem. We show that this distinction causes
a simple proof that SCMP is in NP to fail; whether SCMP is in NP remains open.

<p>Like many UC Irvine faculty I live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Hills,_Irvine">University Hills</a>, a faculty housing complex associated with UC Irvine. It’s a great place to live: the prices are significantly lower than the surrounding area, I like my neighbors, and I love living so close to my office (ten minutes by foot) that I can walk to work instead of having to deal with the twin headaches of Southern California traffic and university parking.</p>

<p>Because it’s so convenient for walking, University Hills is filled with footpaths, many of which pass through greenbelts instead of running alongside the roads. The main footpath leading to the campus from the neighborhood heads towards a building designed in the shape of a giant arch, with the intent of providing a gateway into the central campus. Because the building is part of the engineering school, it’s called the Engineering Gateway. Here it is from the campus side:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/dontwalk/GatewayFromCampus-m.jpg" alt="Engineering Gateway from the UC Irvine campus" style="border-style: solid; border-color: black;" /></p>

<p>It looks inviting, but you wouldn’t know from this view that it’s now a dead end. Here’s a view from the other side, from the end of the footpath that used to connect to it via a crosswalk across the ring road around campus. The crosswalk has been ripped out, replaced by a fence, and planted with ivy to discourage anyone from crossing that way.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/dontwalk/GatewayFromHills-m.jpg" alt="Engineering Gateway from University Hills" style="border-style: solid; border-color: black;" /></p>

<p>Instead, the path has been rerouted to dump you onto the ring road, where a little farther along there’s a new replacement crosswalk. You can get into the campus by crossing there and following a service road (creatively named “Engineering Service Road”) past this lovely view:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/dontwalk/ServiceRoad-m.jpg" alt="Engineering Service Road, UC Irvine" style="border-style: solid; border-color: black;" /></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can still get to the Engineering Gateway by walking a half-block out of your way down the ring road, crossing, and then following this inviting sidewalk another half-block back the way you came:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/dontwalk/PeltasonToGateway-m.jpg" alt="Along Peltason Road to the Engineering Gateway" style="border-style: solid; border-color: black;" /></p>

<p>I don’t usually take either of those two routes. Instead, I take a different path down a different service road, where a narrow gap between the backs of two buildings (the University Club and the computer science department) leads into the campus. Here’s what it looks like on weekends; on weekdays, it’s often completely blocked by delivery trucks.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/dontwalk/LosTrancos-m.jpg" alt="Los Trancos Drive, UC Irvine" style="border-style: solid; border-color: black;" /></p>

<p>It’s almost as if by making these routes so awkward and ugly, the campus offices of transportation and physical and environmental planning, which pride themselves on their <a href="https://sustainability.uci.edu/sustainablecampus/transportation/">sustainability</a>, are trying to send the faculty a message. But what could that message be?</p>

Starting PhD students over time would always assume that the computer science academic job market would be a strong or as weak when they graduate as it is when they were starting, and they would always be wrong. That may have changed. We've had such a stretch of strong growth in computer science, starting as we pulled out of the financial crisis in 2012, that students who started in the strong market back then see only a much stronger market today.<br />
<br />
Every fall I recap advice for students, and others, looking for academic jobs. Best source are the ads from the <a href="https://cra.org/ads/">CRA</a> and the <a href="https://jobs.acm.org/">ACM</a>. For theoretical computer science specific postdoc and faculty positions check out <a href="https://cstheory-jobs.org/">TCS Jobs</a> and <a href="http://dmatheorynet.blogspot.com/">Theory Announcements</a>. If you have jobs to announce, please post to the above and/or feel free to leave a comment on this post. Even if you don't see an ad, almost surely your favorite university is looking to hire computer scientists. Check out their website or email someone at the department. The CRA just published a <a href="https://cra.org/2019-member-book-full-size">member book</a>, a collection of one pagers for several departments, almost all of which are trying to grow.<br />
<br />
Needless to say we're trying to greatly expand computing at Illinois Tech, come <a href="https://science.iit.edu/computer-science/people/openings#tenure-track">join us</a>.<br />
<br />
Something new this year, CATCS is <a href="https://thmatters.wordpress.com/2019/10/02/a-solicitation-for-tcs-job-market-profiles/">collecting and disseminating</a> profiles of junior theory researchers on the job market this year. Definitely take advantage whether to sign up as a job seeker or to reach out to theorists on the market once the profiles are posted. The CRA also maintains a <a href="https://cra.org/cv-database/">CV database</a> for candidates for academic, industrial and government research positions.<br />
<br />
While this is a job-seekers market, you still need to put your best foot forward. Reach out to professors at conferences, such as the upcoming FOCS. Polish your CV and get your Google Scholar page in good shape. Practice your job talk, a bad one can kill your visit. Research the people you will see during the interview ahead of time, I like to write down one interesting discussion topic for each. You'll need to sell yourself to non-theorists. Data, cybersecurity and quantum are hot this year, highlight your work in those areas without making it look fake.<br />
<br />
In any case have fun! You'll meet lots of interesting people in your job search and eat way too much.</div>

<p>The mathematical equations in my blog posts, and the ones you see on many other web sites, are formatted with <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>, a JavaScript library that lets web developers write LaTeX formulas and turns them within your browser into nicely formatted math. The web pages of my blog are generated by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a static web site generation system (meaning that it doesn’t go querying a database for its content, they are just web pages stored in files somewhere). I can write my posts in more than one format, but since the <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2017/04/10/back-up.html">April 2017 LiveJournal apocalypse</a> I’ve been writing them using <a href="https://kramdown.gettalong.org">kramdown</a>, a system built into Jekyll for transforming marked-up text files into html ready for browsers to read and display. And so far mostly those different systems have been getting along really well together. Kramdown knows about MathJax and can handle equations in its input without trying to interpret their syntax as kramdown codes, Jekyll only needs me to modify a template somewhere so that my blog pages include an invocation of the MathJax library, and MathJax in your browser happily formats the equations in my posts. But recently, the MathJax people released MathJax version 3.0.0, and that doesn’t work so well with Jekyll and Kramdown. Despite some difficulty, I seem to have gotten them working again. So I thought it might be helpful to post here what went wrong and how I fixed it, in case others run into the same issues.</p>

<p>There are multiple ways of invoking MathJax, but the one I’ve been using is simply to put a line in my html headers saying to load the MathJax library from a content distribution network (asynchronously, so that it doesn’t delay the pages from being shown to readers). Once MathJax loads, it scans through the html that it has been applied to, looking for blocks of math to reformat. The default way of marking these blocks is to include them in <code class="highlighter-rouge">\( ... \)</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">\[ ... \]</code> delimiters (for inline formulas and display formulas that go on a line of their own, as you might use in LaTeX if you aren’t still using <code class="highlighter-rouge">$ ... $</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">$$ ... $$</code> instead). There are ways of changing the defaults, and those ways have also changed between MathJax 2 and MathJax 3, but I wasn’t using them.</p>

<p>In kramdown, you don’t use the same delimiters for math. Kramdown expects to see mathematical formulas delimited by <code class="highlighter-rouge">$$ ... $$</code> in its marked-up text input, always. It will determine from context whether it’s an inline formula or a display formula. It also doesn’t use the default delimiters in the html that it generates. Instead it outputs html that puts inline formulas inside <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;script type="math/tex"&gt; ... &lt;/script&gt;</code> html tags, and, similarly, puts display formulas inside <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;script type="math/tex; mode=display"&gt; ... &lt;/script&gt;</code> tags. This all worked in MathJax 2, and these script delimiters are <a href="http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/earlier/jsMath.html">still recommended in the MathJax 3 documentation</a>, but they don’t work any more.</p>

<p>The right way to fix this would be either to get MathJax 3 to understand the script delimiters, or to get kramdown to know how to generate something that works in MathJax 3, but I don’t have a lot of control over either. And the second-best fix might be to use some other software after kramdown runs, to change the delimiters in the static html files before they get served to anyone, but I don’t have that option on my blog host. Instead, I followed <a href="https://kramdown.gettalong.org/math_engine/mathjax.html">a suggestion in the kramdown documentation</a> for working with <a href="https://katex.org">KaTeX</a>, a competing JavaScript library to MathJax for formatting mathematical equations in web pages. The suggestion is to add to your html files a little but of glue JavaScript code that recognizes the formula delimiters produced by kramdown and does something with them. In my case, the something that I want to do is just to convert them to the delimiters that MathJax defaultly recognizes.</p>

<p>Timing is crucial here. If I try to run the JavaScript to convert the delimiters too early, they won’t yet be part of the html document that the JavaScript is running on and won’t be found and converted. In particular, running it at the time the html headers are parsed is too early. If I run it too late, the web page will already have been shown to the person viewing it, and each conversion step of each delimiter will also be shown as a slow and unsightly change of the text, on top of the later changes performed by MathJax. You can put JavaScript code at the end of the body of an html page, but that would be too late. Additionally, MathJax should be loaded asynchronously (to prevent slowdowns before the viewer sees something useful from the web page) but must not run until all of the delimiter conversions are complete, because otherwise it won’t see the converted delimiters. So I ended up with the following chunk of JavaScript code, in the Jekyll file <code class="highlighter-rouge">_includes/head.html</code> that gets copied into the headers of my html pages. It waits until the entire document is loaded, converts the delimiters, and then loads the MathJax library.</p>

<p>This could be simplified somewhat with JQuery, but I didn’t do that because this is the only JavaScript in my files and the overhead of loading JQuery seemed too much for that small use. It’s my first JavaScript code ever, so it could probably be done better by someone with more experience. And it’s a bit of a hack, but it seems to work. One other change that I made implies that you won’t see this code in the html for this post, though. The reason is that I don’t want MathJax incorrectly interpreting the example delimiters in my post and in the code block above as actual mathematics formula delimiters. So I also added some Jekyll conditionals that, with the right keyword in the header of a post, disable including the MathJax Javascript, and I’m using that keyword on this post.</p>

<p>…and I thought I was done, until I started looking at some mathematics-intensive older posts, and found some more problems. In a few cases, kramdown has been putting more than just the script delimiters around its math formulas. Within the script tags, the math has been surrounded by a second level of delimiters, <code class="highlighter-rouge">% &lt;![CDATA[ ... %]]&gt;</code>. This coding tells the html parser not to worry about weird special characters in the formula, and it was ignored by the old MathJax because the percent signs cause the rest of their lines to be treated as a comment. But the new MathJax parser doesn’t like the comments (or maybe treats the whole formula as a comment despite the newline characters within it) and displays a blank. This behavior is triggered in kramdown when a formula uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;</code> instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">\lt</code> (easy enough to avoid), or when it uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code> (e.g. in an aligned set of equations, not easy to avoid). So the actual code I ended up with is a little more complicated:</p>

<p>If an origami crease pattern tells you where to put the folds, but not which way to fold them, you may have many choices left to make. A familiar example is the square grid. You can pleat (accordion-fold) the horizontal lines of the grid, and then pleat the resulting folded strip of paper along the vertical lines; the result will be that each horizontal line is consistently a mountain fold or a valley fold, but each vertical line has folds that alternate between mountain and valley. Or you could pleat the vertical lines first, and then the horizontal lines, getting a different folded state. There are many other choices beyond these two.</p>

<p>The famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miura_fold">Miura-ori</a> is another grid-like fold made out of parallelograms instead of squares, and known for its ability to continuously unfold from its folded state to an expanded and completely open state. Like the square grid, a pattern of crease lines in the same positions has many alternative foldings. In fact, this multiplicity of folded states can be helpful in making the miura-ori out of paper. To make it, you can start with pleating a set of parallel lines (like the square grid) to form a folded strip of paper, and then pleat in a different direction that forms a non-right angle to the first pleating direction. The result will be a fold that is not the Miura-ori, but that has its folds in the same places as the Miura-ori. By reversing the orientation of some of these folds, you get the Miura-ori itself.</p>

<p>When working with the space of all foldings of a crease pattern, it’s unfortunately a bit complicated to understand which patterns fold flat (globally, as an entire structure) and which don’t. In a celebrated result from SODA 1996, Bern and Hayes showed that, for arbitrary crease patterns, even determining whether there exists a globally flat-foldable state is NP-complete. So it’s easier to work with “local flat foldings”, meaning a labeling of all of the creases as mountain or valley folds with the property that the creases surrounding each vertex of the folding pattern could be folded flat, if only all of that other stuff farther away from the vertex didn’t get in the way. It’s easy to check whether a single vertex can be folded flat using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maekawa%27s_theorem">Maekawa’s theorem</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawasaki%27s_theorem">Kawasaki’s theorem</a> and related results.</p>

<p><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2014/10/08/forced-creases-in.html">In an earlier paper</a>, my co-authors and I studied the space of all local flat foldings of the Miura-ori crease pattern, from the point of view of seeking <em>forcing sets</em>, mountain-valley assignments to small subsets of the creases with the property that there is only one way to extend them to a locally flat-foldable mountain-valley assignment on the whole crease pattern. My new preprint, “Face flips in origami tessellations” (with Akitaya, Dujmović, Hull, Jain, and Lubiw, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05667">arXiv:1910.05667</a>) instead looks at the connectivity of the system of all local flat foldings. If you’re in one locally flat-folded state (say, the state that you get from pleating the paper once and then pleating the folded strip a second time in a non-orthogonal direction) and you want to get to a different flat-folded state (say, the Miura-ori itself), how many moves does it take? Here, we’re not just allowing any change of a single crease from mountain to valley or vice versa to count as a move. Instead, a move is what happens when you change all of the folds surrounding a single face of the crease pattern, in such a way that the new mountain-valley assignment remains flat-foldable.</p>

<p>The results vary dramatically according to the folding pattern. For the square grid, every square can be flipped, and given any two mountain-valley assignments you can color the squares black or white according to whether they are surrounded an even or odd number of times by cycles of creases that need to be changed. Then the shortest way to get from one assignment to the other is either to flip all the black squares or to flip all the white squares. For a grid of equilateral triangles, it is possible to flip from any mountain-valley assignment to any other one within a polynomial number of steps, but finding the shortest sequence is NP-complete. And for the Miura-ori, it’s again always possible, and there’s a nontrivial polynomial time algorithm for finding the shortest flip sequence. We also have examples of crease patterns forming periodic tilings of the plane where nothing is flippable (so the state space becomes totally disconnected) or where the flippable faces form an independent set (so you merely have to flip the faces whose surrounding mountain-valley assignments differ, in any order). The image below shows two crease patterns of the latter type (called square twist tessellations) with the flippable faces colored blue.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/sqtwist.svg" alt="Square twist tessellations" /></p>

<p>I think the results for the Miura-ori are particularly neat, so I want to outline them in a little more detail. There’s a natural bijection between local flat-foldings of the Miura crease pattern and 3-colorings of the squares of a square grid, which we used <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2014/10/08/forced-creases-in.html">in the earlier paper</a>, and flips of Miura faces correspond in the same way to recoloring steps in which we change the color of a single square. There’s also a natural correspondence (but not a bijection!) between 3-colorings of a grid and “height functions”, giving an integer height to each square, with each two adjacent squares having heights that are one step apart. In one direction, you can get a coloring from a height function by taking the heights mod 3. In the other direction, starting from a colored grid and a choice of the height of one of the squares (with the correct value modulo 3) you can go from there to adjacent squares step by step and figure out what their height has to be. It all works out so that, no matter how you do it, you always get a consistent height function from each 3-coloring. But the function depends on the starting height of the first square. If you add a multiple of 3 to this height, you translate the whole function up or down by that amount, and the translation turns out to be important.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/heightfn.svg" alt="Height function of a 3-coloring of a square grid" /></p>

<p>So if you have two different local flat foldings of the Miura crease pattern, you can translate them in this way into two different 3-colorings, and two different height functions. Then you can convert one of the height functions into the other one, move by move, by repeatedly finding the square whose height is farthest away from its final value and shifting it two steps closer. The total number of steps equals half the volume of the three-dimensional space between the two height functions, and that’s the best you can do to get one height function to the other. But it might not be the best you can do to get one 3-coloring to the other, because of the choice of starting heights. To find the minimum number of moves to get from one local flat folding to another there’s one more computation that you have to do first: find two starting heights for the two height functions that makes the volume between them as small as possible.</p>

<p>For a bit more on height functions, 3-colorings, and the “arctic circle” that one gets by choosing 3-colorings of the square grid randomly, you can read the web page “<a href="http://www.joakimlinde.se/projects/3coloring/">random 3-coloring of the square and cubic lattice</a>”, by Joakim Linde, describing his joint work with Cris Moore in this area.</p>

As Anton Kotzig proved in 1955, the answer is 13. A worst-case example is the triakis icosahedron, whose minimum-degree edges connect vertices of degrees 3 and 10.</p>

<p>The next TCS+ talk will take place this coming Tuesday, October 22th at 1:00 PM Eastern Time (10:00 AM Pacific Time, 19:00 Central European Time, 17:00 UTC) <span style="color: #993300;"><em>(note the unusual day)</em></span>. <strong>Hao Huang</strong> from Emory University will speak about “<em>A proof of the Sensitivity Conjecture</em>” (abstract below).</p>
<p>Please make sure you reserve a spot for your group to join us live by signing up on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/livetalk/live-seat-reservation">the online form</a>. As usual, for more information about the TCS+ online seminar series and the upcoming talks, or to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/suggest">suggest</a> a possible topic or speaker, please see <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/">the website</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Abstract: In the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" />-dimensional hypercube graph, one can easily choose half of the vertices such that they induce an empty graph. However, having even just one more vertex would cause the induced subgraph to contain a vertex of degree at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="\sqrt{n}" class="latex" title="\sqrt{n}" />. This result is best possible, and improves a logarithmic lower bound shown by Chung, Furedi, Graham and Seymour in 1988. In this talk we will discuss a very short algebraic proof of it.</p>
<p>As a direct corollary of this purely combinatorial result, the sensitivity and degree of every boolean function are polynomially related. This solves an outstanding foundational problem in theoretical computer science, the Sensitivity Conjecture of Nisan and Szegedy.</p></blockquote>

<h3><a class="entryheader" href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/10/the-sheldon-conjecture-too-late-for.html">The Sheldon Conjecture (too late for Problems with a Point)</a></h3>
<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<br />
Chapter 5 of <i>Problems with a Point</i> (by Gasarch and Kruskal) is about how mathematical objects get their names. If it was an e-book that I could edit and add to (is this a good idea or not? later on that) then I would have added the following.<br />
<br />
<b>The Sheldon Conjecture</b><br />
<br />
Background: Nobel Laureate Sheldon Cooper has said that 73 is the best number because<br />
<br />
a) 73 is prime.<br />
<br />
b) 73 is the 21st prime and note that 7*3=21.<br />
<br />
c) The mirror of 73, namely 37, is prime.<br />
<br />
d) 37 is the 12th prime, and 12 is the mirror of 21.<br />
<br />
Sheldon never quite said its the <i>only</i> such number; that was conjectured by Jessie Byrnes, Chris Spicer, and Alyssa Turnquist <a href="http://digital.ipcprintservices.com/article/The_SHELDON_CONJECTURE/2298528/276852/article.html">here</a>. They called it <i>Sheldon's Conjecture</i> probably since Sheldon Cooper <i>should have</i> conjectured it <br />
<br />
Why didn't Sheldon make Sheldon's conjecture? This kind of question has been asked before:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04718">Could Euler have conjectured the prime number theorem</a><br />
<br />
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06303">Why didn't Hilbert (or others) pursue Ramsey Theory?</a> <br />
<br />
(readers are encouraged to give other examples)<br />
<br />
I doubt we'll be asking this about Sheldon Cooper since he is a fictional character.<br />
<br />
I am delighted that<br />
<br />
a) There is a Sheldon's Conjecture.<br />
<br />
b) It has been solved by Pomerance and Spicer, see <a href="https://math.dartmouth.edu/~carlp/sheldon02132019.pdf">here</a><br />
<br />
Actually (b) might not be so delightful--- once a conjecture is proven its stops being called by the name of the conjecturer. If you don't believe me just ask Vazsonyi or Baudet. If you don't know who they are then (1) see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2009/08/how-much-credit-should-conjecturer-get_14.html">here</a> and (2) that proves my point.  So perhaps I wish it had not been solved so <i>The Sheldon Conjecture</i> would live on as a name.<br />
<br />
Another issue this brings up: Lets say that <i>Problems with a Point</i> was an online book that I was able to edit easily. Then I might add material on <i>The Sheldon Conjecture</i>. And while I am at it, I would add <i>The Monty Hall Paradox</i> to the chapter on how theorems get there names. Plus, I would fix some typos and references. Perhaps update some reference. Now lets say that all books were online and the authors could modify them. Would this be good or bad?<br />
<br />
1) Good- The book would get better and better as errors got removed.<br />
<br />
2) Good- The book would get to include material that is appropriate but came out after it was published.<br />
<br />
3) Good- The book would get to include material that is appropriate but the authors forgot to include the first time around.<br />
<br />
4) Bad- For referencing the book or for book reviews of the book, you are looking at different objects. The current system has First Edition, Second Edition, etc, so you can point to which one you are looking at.  The easily-edited books would have more of a continuous update process so harder to point to things. <br />
<br />
5) Bad- When Clyde and I emailed the final version to the publisher  we were almost done. When we got the galleys and commented on them we were DONE DONE! For typos and errors maybe I want to fix them online, but entire new sections--- when we're done we are DONE.<br />
<br />
6) Bad- at what point is it (i) a corrected version of the old book, (ii) a new edition of the old book, (iii) an entirely new book? Life is complicated enough.<br />
<br />
I would prob like a system where you can fix errors but can't add new material. Not sure if that's really a clean distinction.<br /></div>

<h3><span style="color: #0000ff;">Google’s supremacy stone soup</span></h3>
<p>Here is a little update on the Google supremacy claims that we discussed in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/23/quantum-computers-amazing-progress-google-ibm-and-extraordinary-but-probably-false-supremacy-claims-google/">this earlier post</a> (see especially <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/23/quantum-computers-amazing-progress-google-ibm-and-extraordinary-but-probably-false-supremacy-claims-google/#comment-61165">this remark</a>). Don’t miss <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/10/13/gerard-cornuejolss-bakers-eighteen-5000-dollars-conjectures/">our previous post</a> on combinatorics.</p>
<p>Recall that a quantum supremacy demonstration would be an experiment where a quantum computer can compute in 100 seconds something that requires a classical computer 10 hours. (Say.)</p>
<p>The Google experiment actually showed that a quantum computer running for 100 seconds PLUS a classic computer that runs 1000 hours can compute something that requires a classic computer 10 hours. (So, of course, this has no computational value, the Google experiment is a sort of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup">stone soup</a>.)</p>
<p>The crucial mistake in the supremacy claims is that the researchers’ illusion of a calibration method toward a better quality of the quantum computer was in reality a tuning of the device toward a specific statistical goal for a specific circuit.</p>
<p>Let me remark that the mathematics of this mistake seems rather interesting and I plan to come back to it (see at the end of the post for a brief tentative account), and also that while the supremacy claim is false, Google’s calibration method is an interesting piece of experimental physics.</p>
<p>I personally hope that in spite of what appears (to me) to be a major setback, Google will maintain <strong>and enhance</strong> its  investments in quantum information research. We are still at a basic-science stage where we can expect the unexpected.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0000ff;">Detection statistical flaws using statistics</span></h3>
<p>Now, how can we statistically test such a flaw in a statistical experiment? This is also an interesting question and it reminded me of the following legend (See also <a href="http://ceadserv1.nku.edu/longa/confs/biomath2008/Poincare.html">here</a> (source of pictures below), <a href="https://hsm.stackexchange.com/questions/7299/poincar%C3%A9-and-the-baker-was-the-anecdote-true">here,</a> and <a href="https://houstonstatisticians.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/poincare-and-the-bakery/">here</a>) about Poincaré and the baker, which is often told in the context of using statistics for detection. I first heard it from Maya Bar-Hillel in the late 90s. Since this story <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2009/04/07/coffee-cigarettes-and-aggression/">never really happened</a> I tell it here a little differently. Famously, Poincaré did testify as an expert in a <a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/dreyfus.htm">famous trial</a> and his testimony was on matters related to statistics.</p>
<h2>The story of Poincaré and his friend the baker</h2>
<p>“My friend the baker,” said Poincaré, “I weighed every loaf of bread that I bought from you in the last year and the distribution is Gaussian with mean 950 grams. How can you claim that your average loaf is 1 kilogram?”</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bakernormal.png"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bakernormal.png?w=640" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18269" /></a></p>
<p>“You are so weird, dear Henri,” the baker replied, “but I will take what you say into consideration.”*</p>
<p>A year later the two pals meet again</p>
<p>“How are you doing dear Henri” asked the baker “are my bread loaves heavy enough for you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, for me they are,” answered Poincaré “but when I weighed all the loaves last year I discovered that your mean value is still 950 grams.”</p>
<p>“How is this possible?” asked the baker</p>
<p>“I weighed your loaves all year long and I discovered that the weights represent a Gaussian distribution with mean 950 grams truncated at 1 kilogram. You make the same bread loaves as before but you keep the heavier ones for me!”</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bakernormal2.png"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bakernormal2.png?w=640" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18270" /></a></p>
<p>“Ha ha ha” said the baker “touché!”** and the baker continued “I also have something that will surprise you, Henri. I think there is a gap in your proof that 3-manifolds with homology of a sphere is a sphere. So if you don’t tell the bread police I won’t tell the wrong mathematical proofs police :)” joked the baker.</p>
<p>The rest of the story is history, the baker continued to bake bread loaves with an average weight of 950 grams and Poincaré constructed his famous Dodecahedral sphere and formulated the Poincaré conjecture. The friendship of Poincaré and the baker continued for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/stone-soup.jpg"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/stone-soup.jpg?w=640" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18282" /></a></p>
<p>*  “There are many bakeries in Paris” thought the baker “and every buyer can weight the quality, weight, cost, and convenience”.</p>

(For low fidelity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="t" class="latex" title="t" /> is rather small.)</p>
<p>The second order effect of the noise is adding a Gaussian fluctuation described by Gaussian-distributed probabilities <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="G_C" class="latex" title="G_C" /> .

<p>For low fidelity, as in our case, the calibration mainly works in the range where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="G_C" class="latex" title="G_C" /> is dominant and the calibration (slightly) “cancels” this Gaussian fluctuation. This does not calibrate the quantum computer but rather tweaks it toward the specific Gaussian contribution that depends on the circuit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="C" class="latex" title="C" />.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Gérard Cornuéjols</span></p>
<p><a href="http://integer.tepper.cmu.edu/">Gérard Cornuéjols</a>‘s beautiful (and freely available) book from 2000 <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245695625_Combinatorial_Optimization_Packing_and_Covering">Optimization: Packing and Covering</a> is about an important area of combinatorics which is lovely described in the preface to the book</p>
<blockquote><p>The integer programming models known as set packing and set covering have a wide range of applications, such as pattern recognition, plant location and airline crew scheduling. Sometimes, due to the special structure of the constraint matrix, the natural linear programming relaxation yields an optimal solution that is integer, thus solving the problem. Sometimes, both the linear programming relaxation and its dual have integer optimal solutions. Under which conditions do such integrality properties hold? This question is of both theoretical and practical interest. Min-max theorems, polyhedral combinatorics and graph theory all come together in this rich area of discrete mathematics. In addition to min-max and polyhedral results, some of the deepest results in this area come in two flavors: “excluded minor” results and “decomposition” results. In these notes, we present several of these beautiful results. Three chapters cover min-max and polyhedral results. The next four cover excluded minor results. In the last three, we present decomposition results.</p></blockquote>
<p>The last sentence of the preface gives this post some urgency</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>In particular, we state 18 conjectures. For each of these conjectures, we offer $5000 as an incentive for the first correct solution or refutation before December 2020.</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>The book starts with Konig’s theorem, the first figure is the Petersen graph, and among the other mathematical heroes mentioned in the book are Edmonds, Johnson, Seymour, Lovász, Lehman, Camion, Tutte, and Truemper.</p>
<p>The title of this post refers to Baker’s dozen. In the 13th century Bakers who were found to have shortchanged customers could be liable to severe punishment, and to guard against the punishment of losing a hand to an axe, a baker would give 13 for the price of 12, to be certain of not being known as a cheat. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dozen#Baker's_dozen">Wikipedia</a>) In this post we mention a 19th problem for which Gerard offered 5000 dollars. (I am not sure if there is time limit for that problem. I am thankful to Maria Chudnovsky for telling me about the problem.)</p>

<h3>What happened to the 18 problems in the list?</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most difficult problem on the list was solved first: two of the problems in the list were about perfect graphs and were settled with the solution of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0212070">strong perfect graph conjecture</a> by Chudnovsky, Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas. Three of the problems were about balanced bipartite graphs. They <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/1-s2.0-s0095895607000597-main.pdf">were solved by Chudnovsky and Seymour</a> in 2006. Conjecture 4.14 in Chapter 4 was solved by Jonathan Wang (2010) 30,000 dollars were thus collected and 60,000 dollars are still offered (until Dec 2020).</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Balanced bipartite graphs and the 19th problem.</h3>
<p>Balanced bipartite graphs are sort of bipartite analogs of perfect graphs. They are bipartite graphs so that every induced cycle have length divisible by four. Gerard’s 19the prize money problem is also about balanced bipartite graphs.</p>
<p><strong>Conjecture:</strong> Let G be balanced. Then there is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e+%5Cin+E%28G%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="e \in E(G)" class="latex" title="e \in E(G)" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%5Cbackslash+e&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="G\backslash e" class="latex" title="G\backslash e" /> is a balanced graph.</p>
<p>In other words every balanced bipartite graph contains an edge which is not a unique chord in any cycle.</p>
<p>This conjecture is Conjecture 5.20 in</p>
<p>M. Conforti, G. Cornuejos, K. Vuskovic <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927050705120064">Balanced matrices</a></p>
<p>In that paper, this conjecture is attributed to:</p>

<h3><a class="entryheader" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/10/12/hardness-planar-hamiltonian.html">Hardness of planar Hamiltonian decomposition and linear arboricity</a></h3>
<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from 
<a class="entryheader" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/" title="11011110">David Eppstein</a>
<p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>I was getting ready to start writing a paper proving that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_decomposition">Hamiltonian decomposition</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_arboricity">linear arboricity</a> are both <span style="white-space: nowrap;">-complete</span> for planar graphs of maximum degree four. But then I realized that there’s a trivial proof, based on known results:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Finding a Hamiltonian cycle is <span style="white-space: nowrap;">-complete</span> in 3-regular planar graphs.<sup id="fnref:gjs"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/10/12/hardness-planar-hamiltonian.html#fn:gjs" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A 3-regular graph has a Hamiltonian cycle if and only if its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_graph">line graph</a> has a Hamiltonian decomposition.<sup id="fnref:k"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/10/12/hardness-planar-hamiltonian.html#fn:k" class="footnote">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:m"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/10/12/hardness-planar-hamiltonian.html#fn:m" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The line graph of a 3-regular planar graph (its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_graph">medial graph</a>) is a 4-regular planar graph.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A 4-regular graph has a Hamiltonian decomposition if and only if the subgraph formed by removing an arbitrarily chosen single vertex has linear arboricity two.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>That’s not enough for a paper, even though the linear arboricity result resolves a conjecture of Cygan, Hou, Kowalik, Lužar, and Wu (2012).<sup id="fnref:c"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/10/12/hardness-planar-hamiltonian.html#fn:c" class="footnote">4</a></sup> So instead I’ll just leave this here, together with two illustrations I already drew of the gadgets for my proof. It’s a reduction from monotone planar 3-sat, in which the variables are connected in a cycle in the plane, the 3-sat clauses with all variables positive are on one side of the cycle, and the 3-sat clauses with all variables negative are on the other side. Here “planar” means that if you represent each variable and clause as a vertex, draw edges from each variable to each clause that uses it, and also draw edges connecting consecutive variables in the cycle, the result is a planar graph.</p>

<p>My reduction adds a special “truth-setting gadget” to the cycle of variables. It represents the variables by regions of the plane, bounded by edges that are forced to belong to the same cycle in any Hamiltonian decomposition. The truth-setting gadget also forms regions of the plane, again bounded by edges that belong to the same cycle. The truth-setting regions extend through the clause gadgets so that they can reach the other clause gadgets on the other sides of them. A variable or negated variable is true if its region’s bounding edges are in the other cycle than the truth-setting gadget.</p>

<p>Here is the truth-setting gadget (the colored parts of the figure), and the (very simple) variable gadgets (gray shaded regions). Each variable gadget will have one loop of one color above the midline, and another loop of the opposite color below the midline.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/truth.svg" alt="Truth-setting and variable gadgets for a reduction from monotone planar 3-sat to Hamiltonian decomposition" /></p>

<p>And here is the clause gadget:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/clause.svg" alt="Clause gadget for a reduction from monotone planar 3-sat to Hamiltonian decomposition" /></p>

<p>The 4- and 8-vertex subunits in the light yellow disks force the partition into two parts of Hamiltonian cycles to be uniquely determined within each gadget, and the 5-vertex subunits between the variable and clause gadget allow the variable to either connect to the parts of the cycles within the clause gadget or to remain separate from them. To construct a Hamiltonian decomposition, you have to have at least one true variable per clause, so that the clause gadget can be connected to the other cycle than the one from the truth-setting gadget. The reduction produces a multigraph rather than a graph, but that’s easy to fix by replacing some of the vertices by wheels.</p>

<p>Maybe the same idea of having a truth-setting gadget that passes through the clause gadgets can be useful in some other reductions?</p>

<p>It has been six weeks since I moved to Milan, and I am not yet completely settled in yet.</p>
<p>For example, although, as of yesterday, I finally have  working wired internet access in my place, I still do not have a bus card (obtaining the latter has been one of the most stubbornly intractable problems I have encountered) and all the stuff that I did not carry in two bags is still in transit in a container.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the busyness of handling the move, getting settled, trying to get a bus card, and teaching two courses, has meant that I did not really have time to sit down with my thoughts and process my feelings about such a major life change. If people ask me what I miss about San Francisco I will, truthfully, say something like UberX, or Thai food, or getting a bus card from a vending machine, because I still have not had a chance to miss the bigger stuff. Similarly, this post will be about random small stuff.</p>
<p><span id="more-4263"></span></p>
<p>Milan is lovely this time of the year. Unlike most other Italian cities, there is no well-preserved historical neighborhood: the city was devastated by WW2 bombings, and then rebuilt; in the center, majestic old buildings are scattered among generic 1960s era condos. Nonetheless, walking along the Naviglio Grande (a canal running roughly in an East-West direction flanked mostly by 100+ year old buildings) at sunset is quite beautiful.</p>
<p>Milan is one of the most expensive cities in Italy, but one can have an awesome sit-down multi-course lunch for 12 euros (tax included, no tip), or a sit-down coffee for one euro. In one of my new favorite dinner places, the old but energetic lady that runs the place comes to the table to offer a choice of a handful of first courses, a couple of second courses and a couple of desserts (no menu); last time I was there she charged 4 euros for two glasses of wine.</p>
<p>Bocconi keeps rolling out its strategy to expand into computing. After introducing an undergraduate degree in Economics, Management and Computer Science, and a masters degree in Data Science, next year will see the start of a new <a href="http://www.unibocconi.eu/phdstatscompscience">PhD Program in Statistics and Computer Science</a>. The deadline to apply is in February, and I would be happy to talk to students interested in applying. The language of instruction, like for almost all degree programs at Bocconi, is English. A new undergraduate program on computing is in the final planning stages, and I will say more about it when it is official.</p>
<p>Between teaching two courses, getting settled, and trying to get a bus card, I have not had a lot of time for research, but the local physicists have been giving us a crash course on the replica method to study optimization problems on random instances. I plan, in the near future, to complete my series of posts on online optimization, and to write whatever I understand of the replica method. An example of what is going on: </p>
<blockquote><p>
physicist: “so the smallest eigenvalue of this nxn matrix is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Cchoose+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="{n \choose 2}" class="latex" title="{n \choose 2}" />, which is negative, and this is a problem because it means that the matrix is not PSD”<br />
me: “wait, what?”<br />
physicist: “don’t forget that we are interested in the limit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Crightarrow+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n \rightarrow 0" class="latex" title="n \rightarrow 0" />.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Coming here, I thought that my command of the Italian language, which I haven’t spoken on a regular basis for a while, would be almost perfect, and this has been true, except that the “almost” part has come from unexpected directions. </p>
<p>For example, one can find a number of places serving real (and very good) Chinese food, which was not the case at the time I grew up in Italy. However, I have no idea how Chinese dishes are called in Italian, for the most part I don’t know how they are called in Chinese either, so I have to resort to the English menu, if available, or to guesswork. Quite reasonably, dumplings are called “ravioli” and noodles are called “pasta” or “spaghetti.” In some places, buns are called, also quite reasonably, “panini”. That dish that I like that is usually called, with much understatement, “boiled fish with preserved vegetables” in America? “Zuppa di pesce”. How do you say “bok choy”? I am still not sure.</p>
<p>In Italian, like in French, you can address someone in a formal or an informal way (in Italian the formal way is to use the third person) and the subtle cues of when to use which form have shifted a little with time, so I have been feeling a bit confused and I have mostly been following other people’s lead.</p>
<p>Bocconi is an exceptionally well run institution. This is true in many ways, from maintenance and cleaning all the way to campus strategic planning, but one of the things that most impressed me, a luxury you do not see on American campuses any more, is that they have <i>secretaries</i>. Not directors of operations, not grant administrators, not coordinators of this or that with lots of underlings, but people that you can go talk to, describe a problem you are having or something you need, and then walk away and forget about it, because they will take care of it, with lots of common sense and professionalism. This is <i>amazing</i>! The cognitive load of worrying about lots of things other than teaching and research is something that it feels just wonderful not to have.</p>
<p>Despite this, the Bocconi administration operates on a shoestring budget compared to American universities. How does it do it? I am collecting figures and I plan to write a separate post about it. If only the Bocconi administration was in charge of issuing bus cards for the city!</p>
<p>It should be noted that, while it has a lot of autonomy as a private university, Bocconi is not a sovereign entity and it is subject to Italian law. For example, I recently had to see two doctors who had to certify that I had no medical condition that would make it dangerous for me to be a professor, and the procedure to hire postdocs is a bit Byzantine (but the secretaries take care of most of it!).</p>
<p>In conclusion, I had some very intense, very exciting, and very rewarding six weeks and, while I do not yet have a bus card, I have a medical certificate that I can teach and do research. Now I am off to eat some Chinese ravioli and maybe a Chinese panino.</p></div>

<p>Sir Timothy Gowers is a Fields medalist and fellow <a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/">blogger</a>. Sometimes he (too) writes about simple topics.</p>
<p>
Today I would like to talk about a simple problem that came up recently. </p>
<p>
The problem is a simple to state “obvious fact”. The reason I thought you might be interested is that I had a tough time finding the solution. I hope you find the explanation below interesting. </p>
<p>
The general issue of proving obviously true statements is discussed here for <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/51531/theorems-that-are-obvious-but-hard-to-prove">example</a>. Here is an example from Gowers:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BI_%7B1%7D%2CI_%7B2%7D%2C%5Cdots+%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{I_{1},I_{2},\dots }" class="latex" title="{I_{1},I_{2},\dots }" /> be intervals of real numbers with lengths that sum to less than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />, then their union cannot be all of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5B0%2C1%5D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{[0,1]}" class="latex" title="{[0,1]}" />. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
He says:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> It is quite common for people to think this statement is more obvious than it actually is. (The “proof” is this: just translate the intervals so that the end point of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BI_%7B1%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{I_{1}}" class="latex" title="{I_{1}}" /> is the beginning point of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BI_%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{I_{2}}" class="latex" title="{I_{2}}" />, and so on, and that will clearly maximize the length of interval you can cover. The problem is that this argument works just as well in the rationals, where the conclusion is false.) </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Problem’s Statement </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The following simple problem came up the other day. Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> is an odd number. Show there is some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28x%2Ct%29+%3D+1+%5Ctext%7B+and+%7D+%284x%2B1%2Ct%29+%3D+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  (x,t) = 1 \text{ and } (4x+1,t) = 1. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  (x,t) = 1 \text{ and } (4x+1,t) = 1. " /></p>
<p>Here <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28a%2C+b%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(a, b)}" class="latex" title="{(a, b)}" /> is the gcd, the greatest common divisor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a}" class="latex" title="{a}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b}" class="latex" title="{b}" />. For example, 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%2821%2C+14%29+%3D+7.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  (21, 14) = 7. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  (21, 14) = 7. " /></p>
<p>This result seems totally obvious, must be true, but I had trouble finding a proof. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Problem’s Cousin </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
There is a unproved conjecture in number theory that says: There are an infinite number of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> so that both <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4x%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{4x+1}" class="latex" title="{4x+1}" /> are prime. This clearly shows that there is an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> for our problem. </p>
<p>
I like conjectures like this since they give you an immediate insight that a statement is likely to be true. But we would like a proof that does not use any unproved conjectures. Our problem can be viewed as a poor version of some of these conjectures. Suppose that you have a conjecture that there are an infinite number of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f_%7B1%7D%28x%29%2Cf_%7B2%7D%28x%29%2C%5Cdots%2Cf_%7Bm%7D%28x%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  f_{1}(x),f_{2}(x),\dots,f_{m}(x), " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  f_{1}(x),f_{2}(x),\dots,f_{m}(x), " /></p>
<p>are all prime for some given functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_%7Bk%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_{k}(x)}" class="latex" title="{f_{k}(x)}" />. Then the poor version is to prove that there are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> so that these numbers are all relatively prime to some given <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" />. There are some partial <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606088">results</a> to the prime version by Ben Green and Terence Tao. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Problem’s Failed Proofs </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
My initial idea was to try to set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> to something like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bty+%2B+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{ty + 1}" class="latex" title="{ty + 1}" />. The point is that this always satisfies the first constraint: that is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28ty%2B1%2C+t%29%3D1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(ty+1, t)=1}" class="latex" title="{(ty+1, t)=1}" /> for any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />. Then I planned to try and show there must be some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> that satisfies the second constraint. Thus the goal is to prove there is some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%284%28ty%2B1%29%2B1%2C+t%29+%3D+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  (4(ty+1)+1, t) = 1. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  (4(ty+1)+1, t) = 1. " /></p>
<p>But this is false. Note that if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{5}" class="latex" title="{5}" /> divides <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> then 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++4%28ty%2B1%29%2B1+%3D+4ty+%2B+5+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  4(ty+1)+1 = 4ty + 5 " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  4(ty+1)+1 = 4ty + 5 " /></p>
<p>and so <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4x%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{4x+1}" class="latex" title="{4x+1}" /> is always divisible by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{5}" class="latex" title="{5}" />. Ooops. </p>
<p>
My next idea was to set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> to a more “clever” value. I tried 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x+%3D+ty+%2B+d.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  x = ty + d. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  x = ty + d. " /></p>
<p>Here I thought that I could make <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" /> special and control the situation. Now 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++4%28ty%2Bd%29%2B1+%3D+4ty+%2B+4d%2B1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  4(ty+d)+1 = 4ty + 4d+1. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  4(ty+d)+1 = 4ty + 4d+1. " /></p>
<p>This looked promising. I then said to myself that why not make <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4d%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{4d+1}" class="latex" title="{4d+1}" /> a large prime <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" />. Then clearly 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++4x+%2B+1+%3D+%284t%29y+%2B+p.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  4x + 1 = (4t)y + p. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  4x + 1 = (4t)y + p. " /></p>
<p>Since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4t%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{4t}" class="latex" title="{4t}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" /> are relatively prime by the famous Dirichlet’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet%27s_theorem_on_arithmetic_progressions">Theorem</a> on arithmetic progressions we could make <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4x%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{4x+1}" class="latex" title="{4x+1}" /> a prime too by selecting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />. This would satisfy the second constraint, and we are done.</p>
<p>
Not quite. The trouble is that we need to have also that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28x%2Ct%29+%3D+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  (x,t) = 1. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  (x,t) = 1. " /></p>
<p>Now this is 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28ty+%2B+d%2C+t%29+%3D+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  (ty + d, t) = 1. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  (ty + d, t) = 1. " /></p>
<p>The trouble is that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" /> might not be relatively prime to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" />. So we could just <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /> This seems like a recursion and I realized that it might not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Problem’s Solution </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I finally found a solution thanks to Delta Airlines. My dear wife, Kathryn Farley, and I were stuck in DC for several hours waiting for our delayed flight home. This time was needed for me to find a solution. </p>
<p>
The key for me was to think about the value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" />. It is usually a good idea to look at the simplest case first. So suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%3D1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t=1}" class="latex" title="{t=1}" />, then clearly the constraints 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28x%2Ct%29+%3D+1+%5Ctext%7B+and+%7D+%284x%2B1%2Ct%29+%3D+1%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  (x,t) = 1 \text{ and } (4x+1,t) = 1, " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  (x,t) = 1 \text{ and } (4x+1,t) = 1, " /></p>
<p>are now trivial. The next simplest case seems to be when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> is a prime. Let’s try <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%3D3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t=3}" class="latex" title="{t=3}" />. Now <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%3D1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x=1}" class="latex" title="{x=1}" /> works. Let’s generalize this to any prime <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%3E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t&gt;3}" class="latex" title="{t&gt;3}" />. The trick is to set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x+%5Cequiv+2+%5Cbmod+t.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  x \equiv 2 \bmod t. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  x \equiv 2 \bmod t. " /></p>
<p>Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4x%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{4x+1}" class="latex" title="{4x+1}" /> is equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B9%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{9}" class="latex" title="{9}" /> modulo <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" />, which is not divisible by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" />. This shows that when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> is an odd prime there is always some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" />.</p>
<p>
Okay how do we get the full result? What if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> is the product of several primes? The Chinese remainder theorem to the rescue. Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> is divisible by the distinct odd primes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_%7B1%7D%2Cp_%7B2%7D%2C+%5Cdots%2C+p_%7Bm%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p_{1},p_{2}, \dots, p_{m}}" class="latex" title="{p_{1},p_{2}, \dots, p_{m}}" />. We can easily see that we do not care if there are repeated factors, since that cannot change the relatively prime constraints. </p>
<p>
Then we constraint <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> by: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x+%5Cequiv+1+%5Cbmod+3+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  x \equiv 1 \bmod 3 " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  x \equiv 1 \bmod 3 " /></p>
<p>and 	</p>

Is there some one line proof of the problem? Do you know any references? There are several obvious generalizations of this simple problem, perhaps someone might look into them.</p>

We consider the problem of outputting succinct encodings of lists of generators for invariant rings. Mulmuley conjectured that there are always polynomial sized such encodings for all invariant rings. We provide simple examples that disprove this conjecture (under standard complexity assumptions).</div>

Today, Oct 10, 2019 is William Kruskal's 100th birthday (he's dead, so no cake. Oh well.) William Kruskal was a great statistician. To honor him we have a guest post by his nephew Clyde Kruskal. We also note that the Kruskal Family is one of the top two math families of all time (see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2009/02/baseball-families-and-math-families.html">here</a>). William is a reason why the other two Kruskal brothers went into mathematics: As a much older sibling (6 years older than Martin and 8 years older than Joseph), he encouraged their early mathematical development. <br />
<br />
Here are some pictures of William Kruskal and of the Kruskal Family: <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/billk1.pdf">here</a><br />
<br />
<b>Guest Post by Clyde Kruskal<br />
</b><br />
<br />
I was asked to blog about my uncle, the statistician, William H. Kruskal, on the centennial of his birth. We called him Uncle Bill. He is best known for co-inventing the Kruskal-Wallis test.<br />
<br />
There are two stories that I know about Bill's childhood, which must have been family lore:<br />
<br />
(1) As a young child, Bill was a prolific reader. His reading comprehension outstripped his conversational English. One morning, having just read the word ``schedule'' in a book, and obviously having never heard it pronounced, he sat down to breakfast and asked:<br />
"What is the ske·D<span style="text-decoration: overline;">U</span>·l<span style="text-decoration: overline;">e</span> for today?"<br />
<br />
(2) My grandparents once had Bill take an occupational assessment test. The tester said that Bill was a very bright child, and should become a traffic engineer to solve  the problems with traffic congestion. (This would have been the 1920s!)  As you probably know, Uncle Bill did not succeed in ending traffic congestion. Oh well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Recently there has been a controversy over whether to ask about citizenship in the 2020 census.  In the late 1900s there was a different  controversy: whether to adjust the known undercount statistically.  In general, Democrats wanted to adjust the count and Republicans did not (presumably because Democratic states tended to have a larger undercount). A national committee was set up to study the issue, with four statisticians in favor and four against.  I was surprised  to learn that Uncle Bill was on the commission as one of those against adjustment, since, I thought his political views were more closely aligned with those of the Democrats.  He was very principled, basing his views only on statistical arguments.  I saw him give a talk on the subject, which seemed quite convincing  (but, then again, I did not see the other side).  They ended up not adjusting. <br />
<br />
<br />
For more on William Kruskal, in general, and his view on adjusting the census, in particular, see the pointers at the end of this post.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have more to say. I just hope that I am on the  ske·D<span style="text-decoration: overline;">U</span>·l<span style="text-decoration: overline;">e</span> to blog about Uncle Bill at the bicentennial of his birth.<br />
