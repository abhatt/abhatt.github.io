(Joint Post with David Marcus who was a classmate of mine at SUNY Stony Brook [now called Stony Brook University]. I was class of 1980, he was class of 1979. We were both math majors.)<br />
<br />
David has been reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Problems-Point-Exploring-Computer-Science/dp/9813279974">Problems with a POINT</a> (I'm glad someone is reading it) and emailed me a comment on the following passage which was essentially <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2012/02/dusting-off-my-bookshelf-i-find-book-on.html">this post</a>. I paraphrase what I wrote:<br />
<br />
PASSAGE IN BOOK:<br />
I dusted off my book shelves and found a book on Fortran. On the back it said:<br />
<br />
FORTRAN is one of the oldest high-level languages and remains the premier language for writing code for science and engineering applications. (NOTE- The back of the book uses Fortran but the spell checker I am using insists on FORTRAN. As a fan of capital letters, I don't mind going along.)<br />
<br />
When was the book written?<br />
<br />
The answer was surprising in that it was 2012 (the Chapter title was <i>Trick Question or Stupid Question</i>. This was a Trick Question.) I would have thought that FORTRAN was no longer the premier language by then. I also need to dust my bookshelves more often.<br />
END OF PASSAGE IN BOOK<br />
<br />
David Marcus emailed me the following:<br />
<br />
DAVID'S EMAIL<br />
Page 201. Fortran. One clue is that it said "Fortran" rather than"FORTRAN". Fortran 90 changed the name from all upper case. Whether it is the "premier language" depends on what you mean by "premier". It is probably the best language for scientific computing. I used it pretty much exclusively (by choice) in my previous job that I left in 2006. The handling of arrays is better than any other language I've used. Maybe there are some better languages that I'm not familiar with, but the huge number of high-quality scientific libraries available for Fortran makes it hard to beat. On the other hand, I never wrote a GUI app with it (Delphi is best for that).<br />
END OF DAVID'S EMAIL<br />
<br />
In later emails we agreed that Fortran is not used that much (there are lists of most-used languages and neither Fortran nor FORTRAN is ever in the top 10).  But what intrigued me was the following contrast:<br />
<br />
1) David says that its the BEST language for Scientific Computing.  I will assume he is right.<br />
<br />
2) I doubt much NEW code is being written in it.  I will assume I am right.<br />
<br />
So---what's up with that? Some options<br />
<br />
OPTION 1) People SHOULD use Fortran but DON'T. If so, why is that?  Fortran is not taught in schools. People are used to what they already know.  Perhaps people who do pick up new things easily and want to use new things would rather use NEW things rather than NEW-TO-THEM-BUT-NOT-TO-THEIR-GRANDMOTHER things. Could be a coolness factor.  Do the advantages of Fortran outweight the disadvantages?  Is what they are using good enough?<br />
<br />
OPTION 2) The amount of Scientific computing software being written is small since we already have these great Fortran packages. So it may be a victim of its own success.<br />
<br />
CAVEAT: When I emailed David a first draft of the post he pointed out the following which has to do with the lists of most-used programming languages:<br />
<br />
DAVIDS EMAIL:<br />
The problem with the lists you were looking at is that most people in the world are not scientists, so most software being written is not for scientists. Scientists and technical people are writing lots of new code.  If you look at a list of scientific languages, you will see Fortran, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_programming_language">here</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran#Science_and_engineering">here</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are several Fortran compilers available. One of the best was bought by Intel some time back and they still sell it. I doubt they would do that if no one was using it. Actually, I think Intel had a compiler, but bought the Compaq compiler (which used to be the Digital Equipment compiler) and merged the Compaq team with their team. Something like that. I was using the Compaq compiler around that time.<br />
END OF DAVID's EMAIL<br />
<br />
One quote from the second pointer I find intriguing.  (Second use of the word <i>intriguing</i>. It was my word-of-the-day on my word-calendar).<br />
<br />
<i>... facilities for inter-operation with C were added to Fortran 2003 and enhanced by ISO/ICE technical specification 29113, which will be incorporated into Fortran 2018. </i><br />
<br />
I (Bill) don't know what some of that means; however, it does mean that Fortran is still active.<br />
<br />
<br />
One fear: with its not being taught that much, will knowledge of it die out.  We be like Star Trek aliens:<br />

the minimal cost of a sequence of elementary operations transforming one graph
into another. This measure is fundamental in many areas such as structural
pattern recognition or classification. However, exactly computing GED is
NP-hard. Among different classes of heuristic algorithms that were proposed to
compute approximate solutions, local search based algorithms provide the
tightest upper bounds for GED. In this paper, we present K-REFINE and RANDPOST.
K-REFINE generalizes and improves an existing local search algorithm and
performs particularly well on small graphs. RANDPOST is a general warm start
framework that stochastically generates promising initial solutions to be used
by any local search based GED algorithm. It is particularly efficient on large
graphs. An extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that both K-REFINE and
RANDPOST perform excellently in practice.

size of the description of the automaton. Sakoda and Sipser [STOC 1972, pp.
275-286] were concerned with nonuniform families of finite automata and they
discussed the behaviors of nonuniform complexity classes defined by families of
such finite automata having polynomial-size state complexity. In a similar
fashion, we introduce nonuniform state complexity classes using families of
quantum finite automata. Our primarily concern is one-way quantum finite
automata empowered by garbage tapes. We show inclusion and separation
relationships among nonuniform state complexity classes of various one-way
finite automata, including deterministic, nondeterministic, probabilistic, and
quantum finite automata of polynomial size. For two-way quantum finite automata
equipped with garbage tapes, we discover a close relationship between the
nonuniform state complexity of such a polynomial-size quantum finite automata
family and the parameterized complexity class induced by quantum
logarithmic-space computation assisted by polynomial-size advice.

efficient probing of large and unsorted data. If designed properly, hash-tables
can enable efficients look ups in a constant number of operations or commonly
referred to as O(1) operations. As data sizes continue to grow and data becomes
less structured (as is common for big-data applications), the need for
efficient and scalable hash table also grows. In this paper we introduce
HashGraph, a new scalable approach for building hash tables that uses concepts
taken from sparse graph representations--hence the name HashGraph. We show two
different variants of HashGraph, a simple algorithm that outlines the method to
create the hash-table and an advanced method that creates the hash table in a
more efficient manner (with an improved memory access pattern). HashGraph shows
a new way to deal with hash-collisions that does not use "open-addressing" or
"chaining", yet has all the benefits of both these approaches. HashGraph
currently works for static inputs, though recent progress with dynamic graph
data structures suggest that HashGraph might be extended to dynamic inputs as
well. We show that HashGraph can deal with a large number of hash-values per
entry without loss of performance as most open-addressing and chaining
approaches have. Further, we show that HashGraph is indifferent to the
load-factor. Lastly, we show a new probing algorithm for the second phase of
value lookups. Given the above, HashGraph is extremely fast and outperforms
several state of the art hash-table implementations. The implementation of
HashGraph in this paper is for NVIDIA GPUs, though HashGraph is not
architecture dependent. Using a NVIDIA GV100 GPU, HashGraph is anywhere from
2X-8X faster than cuDPP, WarpDrive, and cuDF. HashGraph is able to build a
hash-table at a rate of 2.5 billion keys per second and can probe at nearly the
same rate.

color multiplicity at most 3 is solvable by the classical 2-dimensional
Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm (2-WL). On the other hand, the prominent
Cai-F\"urer-Immerman construction shows that even the multidimensional version
of the algorithm does not suffice for graphs with color multiplicity 4. We give
an efficient decision procedure that, given a graph $G$ of color multiplicity
4, recognizes whether or not $G$ is identifiable by 2-WL, that is, whether or
not 2-WL distinguishes $G$ from any non-isomorphic graph. In fact, we solve the
much more general problem of recognizing whether or not a given coherent
configuration of maximum fiber size 4 is separable. This extends our
recognition algorithm to graphs of color multiplicity 4 with directed and
colored edges.
</p>
<p>Our decision procedure is based on an explicit description of the class of
graphs with color multiplicity 4 that are not identifiable by 2-WL. The
Cai-F\"urer-Immerman graphs of color multiplicity 4 appear here as a natural
subclass, which demonstrates that the Cai-F\"urer-Immerman construction is not
ad hoc. Our classification reveals also other types of graphs that are hard for
2-WL. One of them arises from patterns known as $(n_3)$-configurations in
incidence geometry.

additional gates that can affect the accuracy of running the circuit. Based
upon a previous work of quantum circuit mapping that leverages gate commutation
rules, this paper shows algorithms that utilize both transformation and
commutation rules. Experiments on a standard benchmark dataset confirm the
algorithms with more rules can find even better circuit mappings compared with
the previously-known best algorithms.

fits with a long-standing conjecture that various refutation and

`Kesten-Stigum threshold' $d_{KS,k} = (k-1)^2$. Along the way, we use the
celebrated Ihara-Bass identity and a carefully constructed non-backtracking
random walk to prove two deterministic results of independent interest: a lower
bound on the vector chromatic number (and thus the chromatic number) using the
spectrum of the non-backtracking walk matrix, and an upper bound dependent only
on the girth and universal cover. Our upper bound may be equivalently viewed as
a generalization of the Alon-Boppana theorem to irregular graphs

In [12] (CCC 2013), the authors presented an algorithm for the reachability problem over directed planar graphs that runs in polynomial-time and uses $O(n^{1/2+\epsilon})$ space. A critical ingredient  of their algorithm is a polynomial-time, $\tldO(\sqrt{n})$-space algorithm to compute a separator of a planar graph. The conference version provided a sketch of the algorithm and many nontrivial details were left unexplained. In this work, we provide a detailed construction of their algorithm.</div>

<p>I’m delighted to announce that quantum computing theorist <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~jswright/">John Wright</a> will be joining the computer science faculty at UT Austin in Fall 2020, after he finishes a one-year postdoc at Caltech. </p>



<p>John made an appearance on this blog a few months ago, when I <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4172">wrote about</a> the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05870">new breakthrough</a> by him and <a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~anataraj/">Anand Natarajan</a>: namely, that MIP* (multi-prover interactive proofs with entangled provers) contains NEEXP (nondeterministic double-exponential time).  Previously, MIP* had only been known to contain NEXP (nondeterministic <em>single</em> exponential time).  So, this is an exponential expansion in the power of entangled provers over what was previously known and believed, and the first proof that entanglement actually <em>increases</em> the power of multi-prover protocols, rather than decreasing it (as it could’ve done a priori).  Even more strikingly, there seems to be no natural stopping point: MIP* might soon swallow up arbitrary towers of exponentials or even the halting problem (!).  For more, see for example <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-expand-the-frontier-of-verifiable-knowledge-20190523/">this <em>Quanta</em> article</a>, or <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2019/04/14/randomness-and-interaction-entanglement-ups-the-game/">this post by Thomas Vidick</a>, or <a href="http://www.henryyuen.net/post/alice-and-bob-visit/">this short story [sic] by Henry Yuen</a>.</p>



<p>John grew up in Texas, so he’s no stranger to BBQ brisket or scorching weather.  He did his undergrad in computer science at UT Austin—my colleagues remember him as a star—and then completed his PhD with Ryan O’Donnell at Carnegie Mellon, followed by a postdoc at MIT.  Besides the work on MIP*, John is also well-known for his <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01907">2015 work with O’Donnell</a> pinning down the sample complexity of quantum state tomography.  Their important result, a version of which was independently obtained by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01797">Haah et al.</a>, says that if you want to learn an unknown d-dimensional quantum mixed state ρ to a reasonable precision, then ~d<sup>2</sup> copies of ρ are both necessary and sufficient.  This solved a problem that had personally interested me, and already plays a role in, e.g., my work on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01053">shadow tomography</a> and <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/dpgentle.pdf">gentle measurements</a>.</p>



<p>Our little <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~qic/">quantum information center</a> at UT Austin is growing rapidly.  <a href="http://sites.utexas.edu/shyamshankar/">Shyam Shankar</a>, a superconducting qubits guy who previously worked in Rob Schoelkopf’s lab at Yale, will also be joining UT’s Electrical and Computer Engineering department this fall.  I’ll have two new postdocs—<a href="https://twitter.com/a_rocchetto?lang=en">Andrea Rocchetto</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~yosiat/">Yosi Atia</a>—as well as new PhD students.  We’ll continue recruiting this coming year, with potential opportunities for students, postdocs, faculty, and research scientists across the CS, physics, and ECE departments as well as the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC).  I hope you’ll consider applying to join us.</p>



<p>With no evaluative judgment attached, I can honestly say that this is an unprecedented time for quantum computing as a field.  Where once faculty applicants struggled to make a case for quantum computing (physics departments: “but isn’t this really CS?” / CS departments: “isn’t it really physics?” / everyone: “couldn’t this whole QC thing, like, all blow over in a year?”), today departments are vying with each other and with industry players and startups to recruit talented people.  In such an environment, we’re fortunate to be doing as well as we are.  We hope to continue to expand.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, this was an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/technology/computer-science-courses-college.html">unprecedented year for CS hiring at UT Austin</a> more generally.  John Wright is one of at least four new faculty (probably more) who will be joining us.  It’s a good time to be in CS.</p>



<p>A huge welcome to John, and hook ’em Hadamards!</p>



<p>(And for US readers: have a great 4<sup>th</sup>!  Though how could any fireworks match the proof of the Sensitivity Conjecture?)</p></div>

<p>
John Roberts is the Chief Justice of the United States.</p>
<p>
Today I will discuss the recent Supreme Court <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/rucho-v-common-cause-2/">decision</a> on gerrymandering.</p>
<p>
The 5-4 decision in Rucho v. Common Cause takes the courts out of deciding if redistricting was done fairly. Roberts, penning the majority argument, felt that it was hard, if not impossible, for courts to determine whether districts were reasonably drawn. That is, whether partisan motives dominated when they were created.</p>
<p>
I will explain what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering">gerrymandering</a> is, and how computational methods may play a role. I must add a takeaway: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>The current view of computational methods to avoid gerrymandering may be based on incorrect assumptions.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>More on this later.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> How It Works </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
You probably know that gerrymandering is used, negatively, to describe creating voting districts that do not reflect the voters will. The term was coined as part of an attack on the then Governor of Massachusetts in 1812. The shape of one particularly contrived district looked like a salamander. Since his name was Elbridge Gerry, it became a <i>gerrymander</i>. He was a Democratic-Republican and was not re-elected. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/07/03/mathematics-of-gerrymandering/gerry/" rel="attachment wp-att-16071"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gerry.png?w=600" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16071" /></a></p>
<p>
Here is a figure from our friends at Wikipedia that presents examples of gerrymandering. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/07/03/mathematics-of-gerrymandering/divide/" rel="attachment wp-att-16072"><img width="270" alt="" class="aligncenter  wp-image-16072" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/divide.png?w=270" /></a></p>
<p>
By redistricting in the above, one can achieve anything from districts all won by the majority, to most won by the majority. These examples, show how the party who controls the districts can control the outcome.</p>
<p>
Well that is an overstatement. They can control the believed leanings of the voters in the districts. In the above example, they can control how yellow a district is. Real life is complicated by other factors: </p>
<ol>
<li>
A candidate may win because they are just more popular. That is a green candidate could still win in a yellow district. <p></p>
</li><li>
A candidate may win because of random fluctuations. If the voter margin is small enough, random fluctuations could change the “expected” outcome.
</li></ol>
<p>
The latter is a danger for gerrymanderers. This <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/blog/what-is-extreme-gerrymandering">site</a> on gerrymandering says: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The trick is not to spread your voters out so much that districts become vulnerable to flipping to the other party in the normal give and take of electoral politics. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> How We Model It </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Since Roberts is not our intended audience we will use mathematical definitions. I am sure Roberts and the rest of the Supreme Court justices are smart, but we have our own methods. We do not use legal jargon such as “prima facie” and suspect they do not use math jargon like “prime” numbers.</p>
<p>
So let the yellow party have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\alpha}" class="latex" title="{\alpha}" /> fraction of the voters. Suppose the voters have to be divided into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" /> districts of the same size. A division is just a vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%3D%28y_%7B1%7D%2C%5Cdots%2Cy_%7Bd%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y=(y_{1},\dots,y_{d})}" class="latex" title="{y=(y_{1},\dots,y_{d})}" /> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++y_%7B1%7D+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+y_%7Bd%7D+%3D+1%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  y_{1} + \cdots + y_{d} = 1, " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  y_{1} + \cdots + y_{d} = 1, " /></p>
<p>and each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By_%7Bi%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y_{i}}" class="latex" title="{y_{i}}" /> is non-negative. For such a vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> the number that yellow <i>wins</i> is the number of indices <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k}" class="latex" title="{k}" /> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++y_%7Bk%7D+%5Cge+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2d%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  y_{k} \ge \frac{1}{2d}. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  y_{k} \ge \frac{1}{2d}. " /></p>
<p>Note, we assume that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1/2}" class="latex" title="{1/2}" /> of the voters makes a district a win. We can change this to strictly larger than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1/2}" class="latex" title="{1/2}" />, but will leave it for now.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Definition 1</b> <em> Define <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Crm+MaxWin%7D%28d%2C+%5Calpha%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{{\rm MaxWin}(d, \alpha)}" class="latex" title="{{\rm MaxWin}(d, \alpha)}" /> to the maximum over all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> of the number of wins; and define <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Crm+MinWin%7D%28d%2C+%5Calpha%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{{\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha)}" class="latex" title="{{\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha)}" /> to be the minimum number of wins. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Note, we do not care who is doing the redistricting. Nor do we care about the geometry. For example 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%7B%5Crm+MaxWin%7D%285%2C+0.60%29+%3D+5+%5Ctext%7B+and+%7D+%7B%5Crm+MinWin%7D%285%2C+0.60%29+%3D+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  {\rm MaxWin}(5, 0.60) = 5 \text{ and } {\rm MinWin}(5, 0.60) = 1. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  {\rm MaxWin}(5, 0.60) = 5 \text{ and } {\rm MinWin}(5, 0.60) = 1. " /></p>
<p>What can we say about these functions? Here are some simple observations.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%5Cge+0.5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\alpha \ge 0.5}" class="latex" title="{\alpha \ge 0.5}" />, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Crm+MaxWin%7D%28d%2C+%5Calpha%29+%3D+d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{{\rm MaxWin}(d, \alpha) = d}" class="latex" title="{{\rm MaxWin}(d, \alpha) = d}" />. Just place <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\alpha }" class="latex" title="{\alpha }" /> fraction of the voters in each district.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%3E+0.5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\alpha &gt; 0.5}" class="latex" title="{\alpha &gt; 0.5}" />, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Crm+MinWin%7D%28d%2C+%5Calpha%29+%5Cge+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{{\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha) \ge 1}" class="latex" title="{{\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha) \ge 1}" />. No matter how the districts are drawn there must be at least one where yellow has a majority. </p>
<p>
An advantage of these functions is that now we can discuss growth rates, not just present examples. A strength of theory is that we have replaced statements like “this algorithm is fast” by formulas for their running time. Another advantage is that these functions are <i>independent of geometry</i>. Previously I thought the dominating issue was how regions looked. Now I believe the issue is how close one gets to the best and worst case: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crm+MaxWin%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\rm MaxWin}" class="latex" title="{\rm MaxWin}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crm+MinWin%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\rm MinWin}" class="latex" title="{\rm MinWin}" />. </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Lemma 2</b> <em> Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%3E+1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\alpha &gt; 1/2}" class="latex" title="{\alpha &gt; 1/2}" />. Then 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%7B%5Crm+MinWin%7D%28d%2C+%5Calpha%29+%3D+d-%5Clfloor+2%281-%5Calpha%29+d+%5Crfloor+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  {\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha) = d-\lfloor 2(1-\alpha) d \rfloor " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  {\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha) = d-\lfloor 2(1-\alpha) d \rfloor " /></p>
</em><p><em></em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
<em>Proof:</em>  Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta+%3D+1-%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\beta = 1-\alpha}" class="latex" title="{\beta = 1-\alpha}" />. Let’s create the arrangement that makes green win as many districts as possible. If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{g}" class="latex" title="{g}" /> regions are mostly green then that takes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7Bg%7D%7B2d%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\frac{g}{2d}}" class="latex" title="{\frac{g}{2d}}" /> of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\beta}" class="latex" title="{\beta}" /> green voters. This implies that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7Bg%7D%7B2d%7D+%5Cle+%5Cbeta.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \frac{g}{2d} \le \beta. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \frac{g}{2d} \le \beta. " /></p>
<p>So it follows 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++g+%5Cle+2%5Cbeta+d.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  g \le 2\beta d. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  g \le 2\beta d. " /></p>
<p>This proves that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{g}" class="latex" title="{g}" /> is equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clfloor+2%5Cbeta+d+%5Crfloor%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\lfloor 2\beta d \rfloor}" class="latex" title="{\lfloor 2\beta d \rfloor}" />. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CBox&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\Box" class="latex" title="\Box" /></p>
<p>
It may help to set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%3D+1%2F2+%2B+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\alpha = 1/2 + \epsilon}" class="latex" title="{\alpha = 1/2 + \epsilon}" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%3E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon&gt;0}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon&gt;0}" />. Let’s agree to ignore the rounding off and delete the floor and ceiling functions. Then 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%7B%5Crm+MinWin%7D%28d%2C+%5Calpha%29+%3D+d-2%281-%5Calpha%29+d+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  {\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha) = d-2(1-\alpha) d " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  {\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha) = d-2(1-\alpha) d " /></p>
<p>and so 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%7B%5Crm+MinWin%7D%28d%2C+%5Calpha%29+%3D+2%5Cepsilon+d.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  {\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha) = 2\epsilon d. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  {\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha) = 2\epsilon d. " /></p>
<p>Thus for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+%3D+1%2F10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon = 1/10}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon = 1/10}" /> we get that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%7B%5Crm+MaxWin%7D%28d%2C+%5Calpha%29+%3D+d+%5Ctext%7B+and+%7D+%7B%5Crm+MinWin%7D%28d%2C+%5Calpha%29+%3D+0.2d.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  {\rm MaxWin}(d, \alpha) = d \text{ and } {\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha) = 0.2d. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  {\rm MaxWin}(d, \alpha) = d \text{ and } {\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha) = 0.2d. " /></p>
<p>This says that independent of any geometry if yellow has a ten percent majority, then best case if they set the districts they could win all, and if green sets the districts the worst they can get is twenty percent of the districts.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> How Algorithms Can Help </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
There is long-term and continuing interest in algorithms that automate redistricting. The hope is that automated systems will be able to create districts that are fair. A trouble with this research is that there is no universal notion of what makes districts fair. The mantra is: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>A redistricting is fair if and only if the districts collectively satisfy some geometric criterion</i>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>An explicit statement of such a criterion, from a <a href="https://bdistricting.com/about.html">site</a> on such algorithms, is: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>The best district map is the one where people have the lowest average distance to the center of their district</i>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course the name “gerrymandering” came from how districts looked. Somehow this enshrined the notion that districts must look right. I feel this could be wrong.</p>
<p>
Here is a quote from a recent <a href="http://district.cs.brown.edu">paper</a> on an algorithm for redistricting. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We propose a method for redistricting, decomposing a geographical area into subareas, called districts, so that the populations of the districts are as close as possible and the districts are compact and contiguous. Each district is the intersection of a polygon with the geographical area. The polygons are convex and the average number of sides per polygon is less than six. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>The authors are Philip Klein and Neal Young, who are well known researchers on various aspects of algorithms. They do interesting work, their paper is interesting, but the assumption that geometry is the key I do not get.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> How To Do Better? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I think that we need to go beyond geometry to understand and avoid gerrymandering. The connection between geometry and fairness is driven—I believe—by tradition. Voters in the same district probably want to be near each other. In the past being near each other was probably important, since travel was so difficult. Perhaps today location is less of an issue then it was before cars, phones, cell phones, internet access, and email. Perhaps districts can be fair and yet do not look good. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
An analogy to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_cake-cutting">cake cutting</a> may occur to you. Recall in the cake cutting problem success is <i>not</i> measured in how the pieces of the cake look. It is only measured by whether the parties cutting the cake are happy. Is there some way to push this analogy? I just came across a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.08781.pdf">paper</a> using the cake cutting method: <i>A Partisan Districting Protocol With Provably Nonpartisan Outcomes</i> by Wesley Pegden, Ariel Procaccia, and Dingli Yu. More in the future.</p>
<p>
Can algorithmic methods help? Is geometry the fundamental issue? </p>

<p>We’ve got four papers this month. A mix of distribution testing, matrix problems, and a different paper on the power of sampling.</p>



<p><strong>On the Complexity of Estimating the Effective Support Size</strong>, by Oded Goldreich (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/088/">ECCC</a>). In distribution testing, a classic problem is that of approximating the support size. By a (now) classic result of <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~valiant/papers/VV_stoc11.pdf">Valiant-Valiant</a>, the complexity of this problem is \(\Theta(n/\log n)\). This paper raises the question of approximating the “effective” support, and that too with more than just samples from the distribution. The \(\epsilon\)-support of discrete distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) is the smallest support among any distribution \(\mathcal{D}’\) such that \(\|\mathcal{D} – \mathcal{D}’\|_1 \leq \epsilon\) (or TV-distance). Denote this as \(supp_\epsilon(\mathcal{D})\). One can also consider a bicriteria version. Given approximation parameter \(f\) and thresholds \(\epsilon_1 &lt; \epsilon_2\), we need to provide a number in the range \([supp_{\epsilon_2}(\mathcal{D}), f\cdot supp_{\epsilon_1}(\mathcal{D})]\). The primary model studied allows for random samples and evaluation queries (where one gets the probability of any known element of the domain). In this model, for arbitrary \(\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2\), there is a continuum of algorithms, trading off query complexity with approximation. At one end, for \(f = O(\log n)\), the query complexity is \(\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon_1)\). At the other end, for \(f=1\), the query complexity is \(O(\log^* n)\). (Here, \(n = supp_{\epsilon_1}(\mathcal{D})\).) There are lower bounds showing the necessity of evaluation queries for subpolynomial query complexities.</p>



<p><strong>Communication and Memory Efficient Testing of Discrete Distributions</strong>, by Ilias Diakonikolas, Themis Gouleakis, Daniel M. Kane, and Sankeerth Rao (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04709">arXiv</a>). This paper adds additional computational constraints to the distribution testing problem. In the streaming setting, the algorithm is only allowed a single pass over the random samples. It has \(m\) bits of storage, much smaller than \(n\), the distribution size. The aim is to minimize the number of samples required for uniformity (and closeness) testing. For uniformity testing in the streaming setting, the paper gives an algorithm that uses \(\widetilde{O}(m + n/m)\) samples. The standard collision algorithm requires \(\Theta(\sqrt{n})\) storage (to store the samples), while this result gives a non-trivial bound for \(m \ll \sqrt{n}\). There are lower bounds showing that these bounds are basically tight. In the distributed distribution testing problem, there are a number of processors, each holding \(\ell\) samples. A referee asks a question to the processor, whose answers are broadcast to everyone. The aim is to minimize communication cost. For uniformity testing in this setting, there is a protocol using \(O(\sqrt{n\log n/\ell})\) bits of communication. As a sanity check, note that for \(\ell = \sqrt{n}\), one processor could simply run the collision algorithm locally to report the result. </p>



<p><strong>Querying a Matrix through Matrix-Vector Products</strong> by Xiaoming Sun, David P. Woodruff, Guang Yang, and Jialin Zhang (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05736.pdf">arXiv</a>). Consider \(n \times d\) matrix \(M\) over some field \(\mathbb{F}\). One gets access to this matrix through matrix-vector products, and wishes to test some matrix property. This is a natural model in many settings, and generalizes the classic setting of query access. A subtle point is that one can only right multiply with “query” vectors, and there are problems where left multiplication can change the complexity. (A nice example in the paper is testing if a square matrix is symmetric. With both left and right multiplications, this is easy, since we can directly access rows and columns. By only accessing columns, this is non-trivial.) This paper studies a number of problems, broadly classified as linear algebra problems, statistics problems, and graph problems. Some highlights are: testing symmetry can be done in \(O(1)\) queries, and the maximum eigenvalue can be approximated in \(O(\log n)\) queries adaptively (but there is an \(\Omega(n)\) non-adaptive lower bound). For graph problems, here’s an interesting discovery. If \(M\) is the adjacency matrix, connectivity requires \(\Omega(n/\log n)\) queries. But if \(M\) is the signed edge-vertex matrix, then this can be done in \(poly(\log n)\) queries. This paper provides a number of interesting directions and problems to study.</p>



<p><strong>The Adversarial Robustness of Sampling</strong> by Omri Ben-Eliezer and Eylon Yogev (arXiv). This isn’t a property testing paper, but how can one ignore a paper on understanding the power of sampling? It’s convenient to think of the following setting. An algorithm gets a stream of \(n\) numbers, and has to answer some questions about the stream (say, the median or other quantiles). The simplest strategy is to take a small random sample of the stream. But what if an adversary was generating the stream, depending on the current sample? Under what circumstances is the sample still “representative” of the stream? The specific results of this paper require getting into set systems and VC dimension, which I’ll leave for the sake of simplicity. Let’s go back to the median question. To get an approximate median, a constant number of samples suffice. A consequence of the main result is that if one takes \(O(\log n)\) samples, then this is robust to adversarial streams. On the other hand, lower bounds show that constant sized samples can be fooled by an adversary. The paper is a really interesting read, and is a nice take on “standard facts” that we take for granted.</p>

<br />
Huang, an assistant professor in the math department at Emory, settled an open question about the hypercube. The hypercube is a graph on N=2<sup>n</sup> vertices where each vertex corresponds to an n-bit string and their are edges between vertices corresponding to strings that differ in a single bit. Think of the set of the strings of odd parity, N/2 vertices with no edges between them. Add any other vertex and it would have n neighbors. Huang showed that no matter how you placed those N/2+1 vertices in the hypercube, some vertex will have at least n<sup>1/2</sup> neighbors. By an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0097-3165(92)90060-8">old result</a> of Gotsman and Linial, Huang's theorem implies the sensitivity conjecture.<br />

I won't go through the shockingly simple proof, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00847">paper</a> is well written, or you can read the blogs I linked to above or even just Ryan O'Donnell's <a href="https://twitter.com/BooleanAnalysis/status/1145837576487612416">tweet</a>.<br />

<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><p>In a recent breakthrough, <a href="http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~hhuan30/">Hao Huang</a> gave a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00847">6 page paper</a> proving the longstanding sensitivity conjecture. (Hat tip, <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4229">Scott Aaronson</a> and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/07/02/amazing-hao-huang-proved-the-sensitivity-conjecture/">Gil Kalai</a>. See this <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/27714/sensitivity-block-sensitivity-conjecture-implications">stackexchange post</a> and <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2016/062/">this paper of Avishai</a> for some links to the literature on this.)</p>
<p>The proof is beautiful and simple. I will write a few words here, but it is probably easier for you to just read the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00847">paper</a>. The sensitivity conjecture <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0097316592900608">was known</a> to follow from the following statement: let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="G_n" class="latex" title="G_n" /> be the <em>Boolean Cube</em> which is the degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> graph on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%3D2%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="N=2^n" class="latex" title="N=2^n" /> vertices identified with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\{0,1\}^n" class="latex" title="\{0,1\}^n" /> such that for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2Cy%5Cin+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x,y\in \{0,1\}^n" class="latex" title="x,y\in \{0,1\}^n" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Csim+y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x \sim y" class="latex" title="x \sim y" /> if their Hamming distance is one. Then, the maximum degree of every subgraph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="G_n" class="latex" title="G_n" /> of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3EN%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="&gt;N/2" class="latex" title="&gt;N/2" /> is at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\sqrt{n}" class="latex" title="\sqrt{n}" />.</p>
<p>Hao proves the above statement by showing that there is a <em>signing</em> of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%5Ctimes+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="N\times N" class="latex" title="N\times N" /> adjacency matrix of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="G_n" class="latex" title="G_n" /> that turns it into a matrix with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="N/2" class="latex" title="N/2" /> eigenvalues equaling <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="+\sqrt{n}" class="latex" title="+\sqrt{n}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="N/2" class="latex" title="N/2" /> eigenvalues equaling <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="-\sqrt{n}" class="latex" title="-\sqrt{n}" />. That is, he shows (using a simple but clever inductive argument, see the 5 line proof of his Lemma 2.2) that there is an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%5Ctimes+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="N\times N" class="latex" title="N\times N" /> matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A" class="latex" title="A" /> with entries in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B+0%2C+%5Cpm+1+%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\{ 0, \pm 1 \}" class="latex" title="\{ 0, \pm 1 \}" /> whose nonzero entries correspond to the edges of the Boolean cube, and such that all the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="N" class="latex" title="N" /> eigenvalues of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A" class="latex" title="A" /> are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpm+%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\pm \sqrt{n}" class="latex" title="\pm \sqrt{n}" /> and they sum up to zero. (Note that this makes sense since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A" class="latex" title="A" /> should have the same <em>Frobenius norm</em> as  the adjacency matrix of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="G_n" class="latex" title="G_n" />. The Frobenius norm squared is both the sum of squares of entries, which is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%5Ccdot+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="N\cdot n" class="latex" title="N\cdot n" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="G_n" class="latex" title="G_n" /> which is a degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> graph, and also equal to the sum of squares of the eigenvalues, which is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%5Ccdot+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="N\cdot n" class="latex" title="N\cdot n" /> if all eigenvalues are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpm+%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\pm \sqrt{n}" class="latex" title="\pm \sqrt{n}" />.)</p>
<p>Once you have such a signing, the result follows from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min-max_theorem#Cauchy_interlacing_theorem">Cauchy’s Interlace Theorem</a> that says that for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%5Ctimes+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="N\times N" class="latex" title="N\times N" /> matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A" class="latex" title="A" /> and any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%5Ctimes+M&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="M\times M" class="latex" title="M\times M" /> matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="B" class="latex" title="B" /> that is a principle sub-matrix of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A" class="latex" title="A" />,</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_%7B1%2BN-M%7D%28A%29+%5Cleq+%5Clambda_1%28B%29+%5Cleq+%5Clambda_1%28A%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\lambda_{1+N-M}(A) \leq \lambda_1(B) \leq \lambda_1(A)" class="latex" title="\lambda_{1+N-M}(A) \leq \lambda_1(B) \leq \lambda_1(A)" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_1%28A%29+%5Cgeq+%5Clambda_2%28A%29+%5Ccdots+%5Cgeq+%5Clambda_N%28A%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\lambda_1(A) \geq \lambda_2(A) \cdots \geq \lambda_N(A)" class="latex" title="\lambda_1(A) \geq \lambda_2(A) \cdots \geq \lambda_N(A)" /> are the eigenvalues of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A" class="latex" title="A" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_1%28B%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\lambda_1(B)" class="latex" title="\lambda_1(B)" /> is the maximum eigenvalue of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="B" class="latex" title="B" />. A corollary of this (which is the only fact we need) is that if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A" class="latex" title="A" /> has its top eigenvalue <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_1%28A%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\lambda_1(A)" class="latex" title="\lambda_1(A)" /> with multiplicity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="K" class="latex" title="K" /> (i.e., <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_1%28A%29%3D%5Clambda_K%28A%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\lambda_1(A)=\lambda_K(A)" class="latex" title="\lambda_1(A)=\lambda_K(A)" />), then every principle sub-matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="B" class="latex" title="B" /> of order larger than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N-K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="N-K" class="latex" title="N-K" /> will satisfy <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_1%28B%29+%3D+%5Clambda_1%28A%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\lambda_1(B) = \lambda_1(A)" class="latex" title="\lambda_1(B) = \lambda_1(A)" />. (In fact, we only need <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_1%28B%29+%5Cgeq+%5Clambda_1%28A%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\lambda_1(B) \geq \lambda_1(A)" class="latex" title="\lambda_1(B) \geq \lambda_1(A)" />.)</p>
<p>Indeed, suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> is a subgraph of the Boolean cube of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%3EN%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="M&gt;N/2" class="latex" title="M&gt;N/2" />. Then the principle submatrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="B" class="latex" title="B" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A" class="latex" title="A" /> corresponding to the vertices of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> satisfies <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_1%28B%29+%5Cgeq+%5Clambda_%7B1%2BN-M%7D%28A%29+%3D+%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\lambda_1(B) \geq \lambda_{1+N-M}(A) = \sqrt{n}" class="latex" title="\lambda_1(B) \geq \lambda_{1+N-M}(A) = \sqrt{n}" /> (since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%3EN%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="M&gt;N/2" class="latex" title="M&gt;N/2" /> and the first <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="N/2" class="latex" title="N/2" /> eigenvalues of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A" class="latex" title="A" /> are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="+\sqrt{n}" class="latex" title="+\sqrt{n}" />).
But it’s easy to show that for every matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="B" class="latex" title="B" /> the maximum eigenvalue of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="B" class="latex" title="B" /> is upper bounded by the maximum <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\ell_1" class="latex" title="\ell_1" /> norm of its rows, which in our case is the maximum degree of the graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" />.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from

<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>The Sensitivity Conjecture, which I blogged about <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=453">here</a>, says that, for every Boolean function f:{0,1}<sup>n</sup>→{0,1}, the <em>sensitivity</em> of f—that is, the maximum, over all 2<sup>n</sup> input strings x∈{0,1}<sup>n</sup>, of the number of input bits such that flipping them changes the value of f—is at most polynomially smaller than a bunch of other complexity measures of f, including f’s block sensitivity, degree as a real polynomial, and classical and quantum query complexities.  (For more, see for example <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~rocco/Teaching/S12/Readings/BdW.pdf">this survey</a> by Buhrman and de Wolf.  Or for quick definitions of the relevant concepts, <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/19902/boolean-functions-where-sensitivity-equals-block-sensitivity">see here</a>.)</p>



<p>Ever since it was posed by Nisan and Szegedy in 1989, this conjecture has stood as one of the most frustrating and embarrassing open problems in all of combinatorics and theoretical computer science.  It seemed so easy, and so similar to other statements that had 5-line proofs.  But a lot of the best people in the field sank months into trying to prove it.  For whatever it’s worth, I also sank … well, at least weeks into it.</p>



<p>Now <a href="http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~hhuan30/">Hao Huang</a>, a mathematician at Emory University, has posted a <a href="http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~hhuan30/papers/sensitivity_1.pdf">6-page preprint</a> on his homepage that finally proves the Sensitivity Conjecture, in the form s(f)≥√deg(f).  (I thank Ryan O’Donnell for tipping me off to this.)  Within the preprint, the proof itself is about a page and a half.</p>



<p>Whenever there’s an announcement like this, ~99% of the time either the proof is wrong, or at any rate it’s way too complicated for outsiders to evaluate it quickly.  This is one of the remaining 1% of cases.  I’m rather confident that the proof is right.  Why?  Because I read and understood it.  It took me about half an hour.  If you’re comfortable with concepts like <em>induced subgraph</em> and <em>eigenvalue</em>, you can do the same.</p>



<p>From pioneering work by Gotsman and Linial in 1992, it was known that to prove the Sensitivity Conjecture, it suffices to prove the following even simpler combinatorial conjecture:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Let S be any subset of the n-dimensional Boolean hypercube, {0,1}<sup>n</sup>, which has size 2<sup>n-1</sup>+1.  Then there must be a point in S with at least ~n<sup>c</sup> neighbors in S.</p></blockquote>



<p>Here c&gt;0 is some constant (say 1/2), and two points in S are “neighbors” if and only they differ in a single coordinate.  Note that if S had size 2<sup>n-1</sup>, then the above statement would be false—as witnessed, for example, by the set of all n-bit strings with an even number of 1’s.</p>



<p>Huang proceeds by proving the Gotsman-Linial Conjecture.  And the way he proves Gotsman-Linial is … well, at this point maybe I should just let you <a href="http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~hhuan30/papers/sensitivity_1.pdf">read the damn preprint</a> yourself.  I can’t say it more simply than he does.</p>



<p>If I had to try anyway, I’d say: Huang constructs a 2<sup>n</sup>×2<sup>n</sup> matrix, called A<sub>n</sub>, that has 0’s where there are no edges between the corresponding vertices of the Boolean hypercube, and either 1’s or -1’s where there <em>are</em> edges—with a simple, weird pattern of 1’s and -1’s that magically makes everything work.  He then lets H be an induced subgraph of the Boolean hypercube of size 2<sup>n-1</sup>+1.  He lower-bounds the maximum degree of H by the largest eigenvalue of the corresponding (2<sup>n-1</sup>+1)×(2<sup>n-1</sup>+1) submatrix of A<sub>n</sub>.  Finally, he lower-bounds that largest eigenvalue by … no, I don’t want to spoil it!  Read it yourself!</p>



<p>Paul Erdös famously spoke of a book, maintained by God, in which was written the simplest, most beautiful proof of each theorem.  The highest compliment Erdös could give a proof was that it “came straight from the book.”  In this case, I find it hard to imagine that even God knows how to prove the Sensitivity Conjecture in any simpler way than this.</p>



<p>Indeed, the question is: how could such an elementary 1.5-page argument have been overlooked for 30 years?  I don’t have a compelling answer to that, besides noting that “short” and “elementary” often have little to do with “obvious.”  Once you start looking at the spectral properties of this matrix A<sub>n</sub>, the pieces snap together in precisely the right way—but how would you know to look at that?</p>



<p>By coincidence, earlier today I finished reading my first PG Wodehouse novel (<em><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10554/10554-h/10554-h.htm">Right Ho, Jeeves!</a></em>), on the gushing recommendation of a friend.  I don’t know how I’d missed Wodehouse for 38 years.  His defining talent is his ability to tie together five or six plot threads in a way that feels perfect and inevitable even though you didn’t see it coming.  This produces a form of pleasure that’s nearly indistinguishable from the pleasure one feels in reading a “proof from the book.”  So my pleasure centers are pretty overloaded today—but in such depressing times for the world, I’ll take pleasure wherever I can get it.</p>



<p>Huge congratulations to Hao!</p>



<p><strong>Added thought:</strong> What this really is, is one of the purest illustrations I’ve seen in my career of the power and glory of the P≠NP phenomenon.  We talk all the time about how proofs are easier to verify than to find.  In practice, though, it can be far from obvious that that’s true.  Consider your typical STOC/FOCS paper: writing it probably took the authors several months, while fully understanding the thing from scratch would probably take … <em>also</em> several months!  If there’s a gap, it’s only by a factor of 4 or 5 or something.  Whereas in this case, I don’t know how long Huang spent searching for the proof, but the combined search efforts of the community add up to years or decades.  The ratio of the difficulty of finding to the difficulty of completely grasping is in the hundreds of thousands or millions.</p>



<p><strong>Another added thought:</strong> Because Hao actually proves a stronger statement than the original Sensitivity Conjecture, it has additional implications, a few of which Hao mentions in his preprint.  Here’s one he didn’t mention: any randomized algorithm to guess the parity of an n-bit string, which succeeds with probability at least 2/3 on the majority of strings, must make at least ~√n queries to the string, while any such quantum algorithm must make at least ~n<sup>1/4</sup> queries.  For more, see the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.0036.pdf">Weak Parity</a> by me, Ambainis, Balodis, and Bavarian (Section 6).</p>



<p><strong>Important Update:</strong> Hao Huang himself has graciously <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4229#comment-1813116">visited the comment section</a> to satisfy readers’ curiosity by providing a detailed timeline of his work on the Sensitivity Conjecture.  (tl;dr: he was introduced to the problem by Mike Saks in 2012, and had been attacking it on and off since then, until he finally had the key insight this past month while writing a grant proposal.  Who knew that grant proposals could ever be useful for anything?!?)</p>



<p><strong>Another Update:</strong> In the comments section, my former student Shalev Ben-David points out a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4229#comment-1813084">simplification</a> of Huang’s argument, which no longer uses Cauchy’s interlacing theorem.  I thought there was no way this proof could possibly be made any simpler, and I was wrong!</p></div>

<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we show that every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7Bn-1%7D%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="2^{n-1}+1" class="latex" title="2^{n-1}+1" />-vertex induced subgraph of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" />-dimensional cube graph has maximum degree at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\sqrt n" class="latex" title="\sqrt n" />. This result is best possible, and improves a logarithmic lower bound shown by Chung, Füredi, Graham and Seymour in 1988. As a direct consequence, we prove that the sensitivity and degree of a boolean function are polynomially related, solving an outstanding foundational problem in theoretical computer science, the Sensitivity Conjecture of Nisan and Szegedy.</p>
<p>The proof relies on important relation between the two problems  by Gotsman and Linial. It uses beautifully Cauchy’s interlace theorem (for eigenvalues).</p>

<p>Sabine Hossenfelder—well-known to readers of <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> for <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4122">opposing the building</a> of a higher-energy collider, and various other things—has weighed in on “quantum supremacy” in <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2019/06/quantum-supremacy-what-is-it-and-what.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+Backreaction+(Backreaction)&amp;m=1">this blog post</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=GKnfVA1v5ow">this video</a>.  Sabine consulted with me by phone before doing the video and post, and despite what some might see as her negative stance, I agree with what she has to say substantially more than I disagree.</p>



<p>I do, however, have a few quibbles:</p>



<p> 1. We don’t know that millions of physical qubits will be needed for useful simulations of quantum chemistry.  It all depends on how much error correction is needed and how good the error-correcting codes and simulation algorithms become.  Like, sure, you can generate pessimistic forecasts by plugging numbers in to the best known codes and algorithms.  But “the best known” is a rapidly moving target—one where there have already been orders-of-magnitude improvements in the last decade.</p>



<p>2. To my mind, there’s a big conceptual difference between a single molecule that you can’t efficiently simulate classically, and a programmable computer that you can’t efficiently simulate classically.  The difference, in short, is that only for the computer, and not for the molecule, would it ever make sense to say it had given you a <strong>wrong</strong> answer!  In other words, a physical system becomes a “computer” when, and only when, you have sufficient understanding of, and control over, its state space and time evolution that you can ask the system to simulate something <em>other than itself</em>, and then judge whether it succeeded or failed at that goal.</p>



<p>3. The entire point of my recent work, on certified randomness generation (see for example <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/certrand2.ppt">here</a> or <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-to-turn-a-quantum-computer-into-the-ultimate-randomness-generator-20190619/">here</a>), is that sampling random bits with a NISQ-era device <em>could</em> have a practical application.  That application is … I hope you’re sitting down for this … sampling random bits!  And then, more importantly and nontrivially, <strong>proving</strong> to a faraway skeptic that the bits really were randomly generated.</p>



<p>4. While I was involved in some of the first proposals for NISQ quantum supremacy experiments (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson_sampling">BosonSampling</a>), I certainly can’t take sole credit for the idea of quantum supremacy!  The term, incidentally, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5813">was coined by John Preskill</a>.</p>



<p>5. The term “NISQ” (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) was also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00862">coined by John Preskill</a>.  He had no intention of misleading investors—he just needed a term to discuss the quantum computers that will plausibly be available in the near future.  As readers of this blog know, there certainly <em>has</em> been some misleading of investors (and journalists, and the public…) about the applications of near-term QCs.  But I don’t think you can lay it at the feet of the term “NISQ.”</p></div>

<br />
My father was a High School English teacher who did not know much math. As I was going off to college, intending to major in math, he gave me the following sage advice:<br />
<br />
1) <i>Take Physics as well as Math since Physics and Math go well together.</i> This was good advice. I took the first year of Physics for Physics Majors, and I later took a senior course in Mechanics since that was my favorite part of the first year course. Kudos to Dad!<br />
<br />
2) π <i>is exactly </i>22/7. I knew this was not true, but I also knew that I had no easy way to show him this. In fact, I wonder if I could have proven it myself back then.<br />
<br />
I had not thought about this in many years when I came across the following:<br />
<br />
Problem A-1 on the 1968 Putnam exam:<br />
<br />
Prove 22/7 - π = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>1</sup> (x<sup>4</sup>(1-x)<sup>4</sup>)/(1+ x<sup>2</sup> )dx<br />
<br />
(I can easily do his by partial fractions and remembering that ∫ 1/(1+x^2) dx = tan<sup>-1</sup>x  which is tan inverse, not 1/tan. See <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/pi.pdf">here</a>.)<br />
<br />
(ADDED LATER---I have added conjectures on getting integrals of the form above except with 4 replaced by any natural number. Be the first on your block to solve my conjectures! It has to be easier than the Sensitivity Conjecture!)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Let n &amp;in N which we will choose later. By looking at the circle that is inscribed in a regular n-polygon (n even) one finds that <br />
<br />
<br />
n tan(π/n) &gt;  π <br />
<br />
<br />
So we seek an even  value of n such that<br />
<br />
<br />
n tan(π/n) &lt; 22/7<br />
<br />
<br />
Using Wolfram alpha the smallest such n is 92.<br />
<br />
Would that convince Dad? Would he understand it? Probably not. Oh well.<br />
<br />
Some misc points.<br />
<br />
<br />
1)  While working on this post I originally wanted to find tan(π/2<sup>7</sup>) by using the half-angle formula many times, and get an exact answer in terms of radicals,  rather than using Wolfram Alpha. <br />
<br />
a) While I have lots of combinatorics books, theory of comp books, and more Ramsey Theory books than one person should own in my house, I didn't have a SINGLE book with any trig in it.<br />
<br />
b) I easily found it on the web: <br />
<br />
tan(x/2) = sqrt( (1-cos x)/(1+cos x) ) = sin x/(1+cos x) = (1-cos x)/(sin x).<br />
<br />
None of these seems like it would get me a nice expression for tan(π/2<sup>7</sup>). But I don't know. Is there a nice expression for tan(π/2<sup>k</sup>) ? If you know of one then leave a polite comment.<br />
<br />
2) I assumed that there was a more clever and faster way to do the integral. I could not find old Putnam exams and their solutions  the web (I'm sure they are there someplace! --- if you know then comment politely with a pointer). So I got a book out of the library <i>The William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition Problems and Solutions 1965--1984</i> by Alexanderson, Klosinski, and Larson. Here is the clever solution:<br />
<br />
<i>The standard approach from Elementary Calculus applies.<br />
<br />
</i><br />
<br />
Not as clever as I as hoping for.<br />
<br />
3) I also looked at the integral with 4 replaced by 1,2,3,4,...,16. The results are in the writeup I pointed to before. It looks like I can use this sequence to get  upper and lower bound on pi, ln(2), pi+2ln(2), and pi-2ln(2). I have not proven any of this. But take a look! And as noted above I have conjectures!<br />
<br />
<br />
4) When I looked up INSCRIBING a circle in a regular n-polygon, Google kept giving me CIRCUMSCRIBING. Why? I do not know but I can speculate. Archimedes had a very nice way of using circumscribed circles to approximate pi. Its on youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rJdkhlWZVQ">here</a>.  Hence people are used to using circumscribed rather than inscribed circles.<br />

This comes despite the group being both strong in research and important in undergraduate education. The apparent cause is Strathclyde’s placement of combinatorics in computer science rather than in mathematics and in their use of standards aimed more at computer science than mathematics (like bringing in large grants).

    <p>Certain conference speakers need to be told that using sans-serif ∑ for one central notation and sans-serif bold ∑ for a different central notation is a bad idea. That decorating both of them by the same subscripts and the same hats doesn’t help. And that when someone asks for clarification of the notation, answering with “We should move on…this is a thing you can compute on your own” rather than actually explaining is rude (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/102323855724493135"></a>).</p>

<p>
Michael Griffin, Ken Ono, Larry Rolen, and Don Zagier (GORZ) have recently published a paper on an old approach to the famous Riemann Hypothesis (RH).</p>
<p>
Today we will discuss their work and its connection to P=NP.</p>
<p>
Their <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07321.pdf">paper</a> is titled, “Jensen polynomials for the Riemann zeta function and other sequences.” The final <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1902572116">version</a> is in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).</p>
<p>
The RH is still open. We are not aware of any update on the status of Michael Atiyah’s claim to have solved it since this <a href="https://blogs.ams.org/blogonmathblogs/2018/10/01/on-michael-atiyah-and-the-riemann-hypothesis/">note</a> on an AMS blog and our own <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/09/26/reading-into-atiyahs-proof/">discussion</a> of his papers’ contents.</p>
<p>
Recall the RH is a central conjecture in number theory, and it has the following properties: </p>
<ul>
<li>
If true, it would greatly enhance our understanding of the structure of the primes: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%2C3%2C5%2C7%2C%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2,3,5,7,\dots}" class="latex" title="{2,3,5,7,\dots}" /> <p></p>
</li><li>
It has resisted attacks for 160 years and counting. <p></p>
</li><li>
There are an immense number of statements equivalent to the RH.
</li></ul>
<p>See, for example, the survey <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.66.3584&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">paper</a>, “The Riemann Hypothesis,” by Brian Conrey. </p>
<p>
Complexity theory has the P=NP question; number theory has the RH. Both seem to be beyond reach, and both are fundamental questions. The recent work of GORZ has created buzz among number theorists—perhaps they are on the verge of a breakthrough? Is there hope that we might see progress on P=NP? Or must we wait 160 years? </p>
<p>
The buzz is reflected in a May 28 <a href="https://www.livescience.com/65577-riemann-hypothesis-big-step-math.html">story</a> in the online journal <i>LiveScience</i>. It quotes Enrico Bombieri, who wrote the official Clay Prize <a href="https://www.claymath.org/sites/default/files/official_problem_description.pdf">description</a> of RH, as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Although this remains far away from proving the Riemann hypothesis, it is a big step forward. There is no doubt that this paper will inspire further fundamental work in other areas of number theory as well as in mathematical physics.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Bombieri wrote an accompanying <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/05/22/1906804116">paper</a> in PNAS, in which the above quoted sentences also appear. We will try to explain what the excitement is about.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Approach and Results </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
RH is equivalent to the hyperbolicity of Jensen polynomials for the Riemann zeta function. Note: A real, polynomial <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p(x)}" class="latex" title="{p(x)}" /> is <i>hyperbolic</i> if all its roots are real—a fancy name for a simple concept.</p>
<p>
There is an analytic function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%28z%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{E(z)}" class="latex" title="{E(z)}" /> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++RH+%5Ciff+E%28z%29+%5Ctext%7B+has+all+real+roots%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  RH \iff E(z) \text{ has all real roots}. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  RH \iff E(z) \text{ has all real roots}. " /></p>
<p>Almost a hundred years ago, Johan Jensen and George Pólya created an approach to the RH based on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%28z%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{E(z)}" class="latex" title="{E(z)}" />. Rather than prove <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%28z%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{E(z)}" class="latex" title="{E(z)}" /> has only real roots, they showed it is enough to show that a family of polynomials <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%28n%2C+d%29%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{J(n, d)(x)}" class="latex" title="{J(n, d)(x)}" /> all are hyperbolic. The point is that polynomials are “simpler” than analytic functions—at least that is the hope.</p>
<p>
What GORZ prove is this: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> For each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" /> and almost all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />, the polynomial <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%28n%2C+d%29%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{J(n, d)(x)}" class="latex" title="{J(n, d)(x)}" /> is hyperbolic. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, “almost all” means that there at most a finite number of polynomials that are not hyperbolic. They also show that for degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" /> fixed, 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Clim_%7Bn+%5Crightarrow+%5Cinfty%7D+J%28n%2C+d%29%28x%29+%3D+H_%7Bd%7D%28x%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} J(n, d)(x) = H_{d}(x). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} J(n, d)(x) = H_{d}(x). " /></p>
<p>Where the polynomials <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH_%7Bd%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{H_{d}(x)}" class="latex" title="{H_{d}(x)}" /> have only real roots.</p>
<p>
This is explained further in a <a href="http://people.oregonstate.edu/~petschec/ONTD/Talk1.pdf">talk</a> by Ono, which has this table showing how the polynomials converge:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/29/a-prime-breakthrough/hyper/" rel="attachment wp-att-16049"><img width="300" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hyper.png?w=300&amp;h=187" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-16049" height="187" /></a></p>
<p>Note: they use different notation for the polynomials.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Approximation Property </h2><p></p>
<p>There are many equivalent formulations of the RH.  While all are equivalent, some are more equivalent than others.  Some seem to be a more plausible path toward a resolution of the RH. Of course to date none have worked. </p>
<p>There is a way to distinguish equivalent formulations of the RH. Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> depends on some parameter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\beta" class="latex" title="\beta" />. Suppose that as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\beta" class="latex" title="\beta" /> increases the statement <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%28%5Cbeta%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S(\beta)" class="latex" title="S(\beta)" /> becomes a weaker version of the RH.<br />
Then let us informally say that the formulation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%28%5Cbeta%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S(\beta)" class="latex" title="S(\beta)" /> has the “Approximation Property” (AP). The point is that progress in proving caes of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%28%5Cbeta%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S(\beta)" class="latex" title="S(\beta)" />—even as partial progress—is exciting. But if the equivalence only holds for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\beta=0" class="latex" title="\beta=0" />, with no connections for higher <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\beta" class="latex" title="\beta" />, then the partial progress could be seen as morally useful—but it is not really mathematically useful.</p>
<p>There are equivalences of the RH that have AP and some that seem not to have it. The approximation for the RH is natural. The RH states that there is no zero <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma+%2B+it&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\sigma + it" class="latex" title="\sigma + it" /> of the Riemann zeta function with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\sigma" class="latex" title="\sigma" /> above <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="1/2" class="latex" title="1/2" />. The weaker statement: If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma+%2B+it&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\sigma + it" class="latex" title="\sigma + it" /> is a zero, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma+%3E++%5Calpha&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\sigma &gt;  \alpha" class="latex" title="\sigma &gt;  \alpha" /> is unknown for any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\alpha" class="latex" title="\alpha" /> in the open interval <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2F2%2C1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(1/2,1)" class="latex" title="(1/2,1)" />. This can be used to get a property with the AP.</p>
<p>For example, this 2003 <a href="http://\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0307215}">paper</a> by Luis Baez-Duarte, titled “A new necessary and sufficient condition for the Riemann hypothesis,” has the AP. He notes, in our terminology, that his property is an AP.</p>
<p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Does the approach of GORZ have the AP? The issue is that while we get a universal statement in terms of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d" class="latex" title="d" />, the “all but finitely many” condition on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> works against its being an approximation—what if the finite sets of exceptions grow in terms of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d" class="latex" title="d" /> in ways that offset the purpose behind the equivalence?</p>

<p>Sorry for the long period of non blogging. There are a lot of things to report and  various other plans for posts and I hope to come back to it soon. But it is nice to break the silence with another sensational result by Annika Heckel. I first heard about it some time ago and Noam Lifshitz just informed be that the<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11808"> paper is on the arXive</a>!</p>
<h2><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11808">Non-concentration of the chromatic number of a random graph</a></h2>
<p>And here is the <strong>abstract:</strong> We show that the chromatic number of $latex <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-1"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-2"><span class="msubsup" id="MathJax-Span-3"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-4">G(</span><span class="texatom" id="MathJax-Span-5"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-6"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-7">n</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-8">,</span><span class="mfrac" id="MathJax-Span-9"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-10">1/</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-11">2)$</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> is not concentrated on fewer than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1%2F4-%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n^{1/4-\epsilon}" class="latex" title="n^{1/4-\epsilon}" />  consecutive values. This addresses a longstanding question raised by Erdős and several other authors.</p>
<p>The Introduction tells the history of the problem very nicely.</p></div>

I'm heading home from the <a href="https://fcrc.acm.org/">2019 ACM Federated Computing Research Conference</a> in Phoenix, a collection of computer science meetings including <a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2019/">STOC</a>, <a href="http://learningtheory.org/colt2019/">COLT</a> and <a href="http://www.sigecom.org/ec19/">EC</a>.<br />
<br />
Geoff Hinton and Yann LeCun gave their Turing award lectures, their co-winner Yoshua Bengio not in attendance. Hinton talked about how machine learning triumphed over symbolic AI. LeCun argued that under uncertainty, one should learn the distribution instead of just the average. If you want more, just <a href="https://fcrc.acm.org/turing-lecture-at-fcrc-2019">watch it yourself</a>.<br />
<div style="text-align: left;">

<div style="text-align: left;">
To get to the STOC lectures you go up and down escalators and pass through ISCA (Computer Architecture) and PLDI (Programming Languages). It's like you are going up the computing stack until you reach algorithms and complexity. </div>

The conference center was just two blocks from Chase Field so we could take in a Diamondbacks baseball game. They opened the roof because the temperature dropped into the double digits. Last night, Paul McCartney played at an arena just a block from the conference center, but instead I hung out at an Uber reception for the EC conference.<br />

Let me mention a best paper awardee, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3313276.3316369">The Reachability Problem for Petri Nets is Not Elementary</a> by Wojciech Czerwinski, Slawomir Lasota, Ranko Lazic, Jerome Leroux and Filip Mazowiecki. In a Petri net you have a list of vectors of integers and an initial and final vector. You start with the initial vector and can add any of the other vectors nondeterministically as often as you like as long as no coordinate goes negative. Can you get to the final vector? This problem was known to be computable in "Ackermannian" time and EXPSPACE-hard. This paper shows the problem is not elementary, i.e. not solvable in running time a tower of 2's to the n. A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08575">recent result</a> shows Petri Nets reachability is primitive recursive for fixed dimensions.<br />

We consider codes for space bounded channels. This is a model for communication under noise that was studied by Guruswami and Smith (J. ACM 2016) and lies between the Shannon (random) and Hamming (adversarial) models. In this model, a channel is a space bounded procedure that reads the codeword in one pass, and modifies at most a $p$ fraction of the bits of the codeword.

Guruswami and Smith, and later work by Shaltiel and Silbak (RANDOM 2016), gave constructions of list-decodable codes with rate approaching $1-H(p)$ against channels with space $s=c \log n$, with encoding/decoding time $\poly(2^s)=\poly(n^c)$.

In this paper we show that for every constant $0 \le p 0$, there are codes with rate $R \ge 1-H(p)-\epsilon$, list size $\poly(1/\epsilon)$, and furthermore:
\begin{itemize}
\item Our codes can handle channels with space $s=n^{\Omega(1)}$, which is much larger than $O(\log n)$ achieved by previous work.
\item We give encoding and decoding algorithms that run in time $n \cdot \polylog(n)$. Previous work achieved large and unspecified $\poly(n)$ time (even for space $s=1 \cdot \log n$ channels).
\item We can handle space bounded channels that read the codeword in any order, whereas previous work considered channels that read the codeword in the standard order.
\end{itemize}
Our construction builds on the machinery of Guruswami and Smith (with some key modifications) replacing some nonconstructive codes and pseudorandom objects (that are found in exponential time by brute force) with efficient explicit constructions.
For this purpose we exploit recent results of Haramaty, Lee and Viola (SICOMP 2018) on pseudorandom properties of ``$t$-wise independence + low weight noise'' which we quantitatively improve using techniques by Forbes and Kelly (FOCS 2018).

To make use of such distributions, we give new explicit constructions of binary linear codes that have dual distance of $n^{\Omega(1)}$, and are also polynomial time list-decodable from relative distance $\half-\epsilon$, with list size $\poly(1/\epsilon)$. To the best of our knowledge, no such construction was previously known.

Somewhat surprisingly, we show that Reed-Solomon codes with dimension $k&lt;\sqrt{n}$, have this property if interpreted as binary codes (in some specific interpretation) which we term: ``Raw Reed-Solomon Codes''. A key idea is viewing Reed-Solomon codes as ``bundles'' of certain dual-BCH codewords.</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For more than 20 years we’ve had <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1%2Bc%5E%7B-d%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n^{1+c^{-d}}" class="latex" title="n^{1+c^{-d}}" /> lower bounds for threshold circuits of depth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d" class="latex" title="d" /> <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/#XImpagliazzoPS97">IPS97</a>]</span>, for a fixed <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="c" class="latex" title="c" />. There have been several “explanations” for the lack of progress <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/#XAllenderK10">AK10</a>]</span>. Recently <a href="https://www.google.com/url%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3D%26esrc%3Ds%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D1%26cad%3Drja%26uact%3D8%26ved%3D2ahUKEwiVrqqOgoXjAhWF1FkKHUgiBjcQFjAAegQIAhAC%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Feccc.weizmann.ac.il%2Freport%2F2018%2F199%2Fdownload%26usg%3DAOvVaw342o4eSvZMdt_vhMYa7kwk">Chen and Tell</a> have given a better explanation showing that you can’t even improve the result to a better <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="c" class="latex" title="c" /> without proving “the whole thing.” </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   Say you have a finite group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" /> and you want to compute the <em>iterated product</em> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> elements. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   <b>Warm-up <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/#XAllenderK10">AK10</a>]</span>.</b>. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   Suppose you can compute this with circuits of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%28n%29%3Dn%5E%7B10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="s(n)=n^{10}" class="latex" title="s(n)=n^{10}" /> and depth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="10" class="latex" title="10" />. Now we show how you can trade size for depth. Put a complete tree with fan-in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> on top of the group product, where each node computes the product of its children (this is correct by associativity, in general this works for a monoid). This tree needs depth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog+_%7Bf%7Dn&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\log _{f}n" class="latex" title="\log _{f}n" />. If you stick your circuit of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="s(n)" class="latex" title="s(n)" /> and depth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%281%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="O(1)" class="latex" title="O(1)" /> at each node, the depth of the overall circuit would be obviously <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Clog+_%7Bf%7Dn%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="O(\log _{f}n)" class="latex" title="O(\log _{f}n)" /> and the overall size would be dominated by the input layer which is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%28f%29%5Ccdot+n%2Ff%3Cs%28f%29%5Ccdot+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="s(f)\cdot n/f&lt;s(f)\cdot n" class="latex" title="s(f)\cdot n/f&lt;s(f)\cdot n" />. If you are aiming for overall depth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d" class="latex" title="d" />, you need <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3Dn%5E%7BO%281%2Fd%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f=n^{O(1/d)}" class="latex" title="f=n^{O(1/d)}" />. This gives size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1%2BO%281%2Fd%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n^{1+O(1/d)}" class="latex" title="n^{1+O(1/d)}" />. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   Hence we have shown that proving bounds <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1%2B%5Comega+%281%2Fd%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n^{1+\omega (1/d)}" class="latex" title="n^{1+\omega (1/d)}" /> for some depth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d" class="latex" title="d" /> suffices to prove <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n^{10}" class="latex" title="n^{10}" /> lower bounds for depth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="10" class="latex" title="10" />. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   <b>Chen and Tell.</b>. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   The above is not the most efficient way to build a tree! I am writing this post following their paper to understand what they do. As they say, the idea is quite simple. While above the size will be dominated by the input layer, we want to balance things so that every layer has roughly the same contribution. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   Let’s say we are aiming for size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1%2B%5Cepsilon+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n^{1+\epsilon }" class="latex" title="n^{1+\epsilon }" /> and let’s see what depth we can get. Let’s say now the size is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%28n%29%3Dn%5E%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="s(n)=n^{k}" class="latex" title="s(n)=n^{k}" />. Let us denote by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n_{i}" class="latex" title="n_{i}" /> the number of nodes at level <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="i=0" class="latex" title="i=0" /> being the root. The fan-in at level <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" /> is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28n%5E%7B1%2B%5Cepsilon+%7D%2Fn_%7Bi%7D%29%5E%7B1%2Fk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(n^{1+\epsilon }/n_{i})^{1/k}" class="latex" title="(n^{1+\epsilon }/n_{i})^{1/k}" /> so that the cost is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1%2B%5Cepsilon+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n^{1+\epsilon }" class="latex" title="n^{1+\epsilon }" /> as desired. We have the recursion <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_%7Bi%2B1%7D%3Dn_%7Bi%7D%5Ccdot+%28n%5E%7B1%2B%5Cepsilon+%7D%2Fn_%7Bi%7D%29%5E%7B1%2Fk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n_{i+1}=n_{i}\cdot (n^{1+\epsilon }/n_{i})^{1/k}" class="latex" title="n_{i+1}=n_{i}\cdot (n^{1+\epsilon }/n_{i})^{1/k}" />. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   The solution to this recursion is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_%7Bi%7D%3Dn%5E%7B%281%2B%5Cepsilon+%29%281-%281-1%2Fk%29%5E%7Bi%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n_{i}=n^{(1+\epsilon )(1-(1-1/k)^{i})}" class="latex" title="n_{i}=n^{(1+\epsilon )(1-(1-1/k)^{i})}" />, see below. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   So that’s it. We need to get to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> nodes. So if you set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%3DO%28k%5Clog+%281%2F%5Cepsilon+%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="i=O(k\log (1/\epsilon ))" class="latex" title="i=O(k\log (1/\epsilon ))" /> you get say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_%7Bi%7D%3Dn%5E%7B%281%2B%5Cepsilon+%29%281-%5Cepsilon+%5E%7B2%7D%29%7D%3En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n_{i}=n^{(1+\epsilon )(1-\epsilon ^{2})}&gt;n" class="latex" title="n_{i}=n^{(1+\epsilon )(1-\epsilon ^{2})}&gt;n" />. Going back to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D10&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="k=10" class="latex" title="k=10" />, we have exhibited circuits of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1%2B%5Cepsilon+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n^{1+\epsilon }" class="latex" title="n^{1+\epsilon }" /> and depth just <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Clog+1%2F%5Cepsilon+%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="O(\log 1/\epsilon )" class="latex" title="O(\log 1/\epsilon )" />. So proving stronger bounds than this would rule out circuits of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n^{10}" class="latex" title="n^{10}" /> and depth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="10" class="latex" title="10" />. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">   <b>My two cents.</b>. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   I am not sure I need more evidence that making progress on long-standing bounds in complexity theory is hard, but I do find it interesting to prove these links; we have quite a few by now! The fact that we have been stuck forever just short of proving “the whole thing” makes me think that these long-sought bounds may in fact be false. Would love to be proved wrong, but it’s 2019, this connection is proved by balancing a tree better, and you feel confident that P <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cne+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\ne " class="latex" title="\ne " /> NP?    </p>

<p>On the Importance of Disciplinary Pride for Multidisciplinary Collaboration</p>
<p>I am a big fan of collaborations, even if they <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2014/07/01/collaboration-competition-and-competition-within-collaboration/">come with their own challenges</a>. I always got further and enjoyed research much more because of my collaborators. I’m forever indebted to so many colleagues and dear, dear friends. Each and every one of them was better than me in some ways. To contribute, I had to remember my own strengths and bring them to the table. The premise of this post is that the same holds for collaboration between fields. It should be read as a call for theoreticians to bring the tools and the powerful way of thinking of TOC into collaborations. We shouldn’t be blind to the limitation of our field but obsessing on those limitations is misguided and would only limit our impact. Instead we should bring our best and trust on the other disciplines we collaborate with to do the same (allowing each to complement and compensate for the other).</p>
<p>The context in which these thoughts came to my mind is Algorithmic Fairness. In this and other areas on the interface between society and computing, true <a href="https://theorydish.blog/2018/11/01/simons-cluster-on-algorithmic-fairness/">collaboration is vital</a>. Not surprisingly, attending multidisciplinary programs on Algorithm Fairness, is a major part of my professional activities these days. And I love it – I get to learn so much from people and disciplines that have been thinking about fairness for many decades and centuries. In addition, the Humanities are simply splendid. Multidisciplinary collaborations come with even more challenges than other collaborations: the language, tools and perspectives are different. But for exactly the same reasons they can be even more rewarding. Nevertheless, my fear and the reason for this post is that my less experienced TOC colleagues might come out from those interdisciplinary meetings frustrated and might lose confidence in what TOC can contribute. It feels to me that <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/PDF/toc-sp2.pdf">old lessons</a> about the value of TOC need to be learned again. There is a lot to be proud of, and holding to this pride would in fact make us better collaborators not worse.</p>
<p>In the context of Algorithmic Fairness, we should definitely acknowledge (as we often do) that science exists within political structures, that algorithms are not objective and that mathematical definitions cannot replace social norms as expressed by policy makers. But let’s not take these as excuses for inaction and let’s not withdraw to the role of spectators. In this era of algorithms, other disciplines need us just as much as we need them .</p>

(title of this blog is due to Henry Baker who posted an article about this elsewhere)<br />
<br />
Amoeba finds approx solution to TSP in linear time:<a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-12-amoeba-approximate-solutions-np-hard-problem.html">here</a>.<br />
<br />
Over the years we have seen models of computation that claim to solve NPC or other hard problems quickly. I ask non-rhetorically and with and open mind how they have panned out.<br />
<br />
In no particular order:<br />
<br />
1) Parallelism. For solving problems faster YES. For speeding up how to solve NPC problems I think YES. For making P=NP somehow NO.  Even so, parallel computers have been a definite practical success.<br />
<br />
2) Quantum Computing. Will they factor large numbers anytime soon? Ever? Should we view the effort to build them as an awesome and insightful Physics experiment? Are there any problems that they are NOW doing faster? Is Quantum Crypto (I know, not the same thing) actually used? Will other things of interest come out of the study of quantum computing? It already has, see <a href="https://theoryofcomputing.org/articles/gs002/gs002.pdf">here</a>.<br />
<br />
3) DNA computing. Did that lead to practical solutions to NPC problems? I do not think it did. Did that lead to interesting math? Interesting biology? Interesting science?  I do not know.<br />
<br />
4) Autistic  computing for finding primes: see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2009/09/possibly-recruits-for-polymath-primes.html">here</a>. Oliver Sacks, the neurologist ,claimed that two autistic twin brothers could generate large primes quickly. This story was never put to a rigorous test and may not be quite right.<br />
<br />
5) Amoeba computing: Too early to tell. The article seems to say it succeeded on 8 cities<br />
<br />
The problem with all of these non-standard models of computing is SCALE.  And the more powerful classic computers get, the harder it is for these nonstandard models to compete.<br />
<br />
Are these models interesting even if they don't end up getting us fast algorithms? They can be:<br />
<br />
1) Do they lead to mathematics of interest? (Quantum- Yes, Parallelism- Yes)<br />
<br />
2) Did they inspire algorithms for classical computers? (Quantum- Yes)<br />
<br />
3) Do they give insight into other fields? (Quantum for Physics yes, DNA-computing for bio-??)<br />
<br />
4) Have they ACTUALLY sped up  up computations in meaningful ways for problems we care about (Parallelism  has)<br />
<br />
If  you know of any result which I missed<br />
<br />
 (e.g.,<br />
<br />
 Amoeba-computing giving insight into evolution,<br />
<br />
Autistic computing being used by the NSA to find primes,<br />
<br />
 DNA computing  leading to interesting mathematics)<br />
<br />
 then leave polite comments!<br />

Lucy Lu Wang is the lead author of a paper released this Friday on gender parity in computer science. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.07883.pdf">paper</a> is from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. The authors are Wang, Gabriel Stanovsky, Luca Weihs, and Oren Etzioni.  We will call them WSWE for short. </p>
<p>
Today we will discuss some of the issues this study raises.</p>
<p>
The paper was highlighted by the New York Times in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/technology/gender-gap-tech-computer-science.html">article</a> titled, “The Gender Gap in Computer Science Research Won’t Close for 100 Years.”  The news article begins with an equally sobering statement of this conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em>Women will not reach parity with men in writing published computer science research in this century if current trends hold, according to a study released on Friday. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
We are for gender-neutral opportunities and have always promoted this—see our earlier discussions <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/03/23/its-ada-lovelace-day/">here</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/10/29/absolute-firsts/">here</a>. We are for doing a better job in supporting women in computer science. The study by WSWE is an important paper that helps frame the problem. Quoting them:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The field has made more of an effort to reach a more balanced gender status. But the data seems to show that even with all the progress, we are still not making the change fast enough. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
I suggest that you might wish to read the paper. Unfortunately there are many papers with similar conclusions—see <a href="https://aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1301">this</a> by Natalie Schluter, for example. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Main Points </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Here are some points of the paper by WSWE:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>There is a measurable gap</i>. No one would, I believe, doubt this. But it is important to see that it is measurable. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>The gap is shrinking, but slowly</i>. Again this seems correct, but whether it is shrinking in all relevant measures of publication weight is still an issue.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>The predictions</i>. Perhaps it will not be closed for over a century. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>Modern technology allows such a study</i>. This is one aspect that we can all applaud. WSWE used automated tools that allowed this study to search millions of papers.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Issues </h2><p></p>
<p>
WSWE filtered a corpus of <b>2.87 million</b> papers tagged as in computer science.  The volume constrained their approaches to handling several basic issues.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" title="{\bullet}" /> How to tell the gender of an author?  They use first names and try to detect gender from that alone. This is not easy.  Not only can differently-gendered names in different nations or language groups have the same Romanized form, many names apply to both genders within those groups.  The names Taylor and Kelley are perfect examples pf the latter. </p>
<p>
WSWE used a statistical weighing method. So “Taylor,” for example, would be weighted as 55 percent female, 45 percent male.  The weightings come from a large database called <i>Gender API</i> compiled from government and social agencies not directly related to computer science. </p>
<p></p><p><br />
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" title="{\bullet}" /> Another issue concerns the prediction part of their paper. They attempt to extrapolate and guess when there will be parity between female and male authorship. </p>
<p>
As all predictions this is not easy. It is my main complaint with this and other papers on the gender-gap issue. They predict that parity will not be reached until 2167, in 168 years. An earlier <a href="https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/640548/gender-parity-computer-science-could-take-280-years/">study</a> puts the parity point at 280 years away.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I believe that a major issue is hiring by computer science departments and other institutions. A major CS department just hired <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%3E1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N&gt;1}" class="latex" title="{N&gt;1}" /> assistant professors, of which <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" /> were male. This is a problem. </p>
<p>
Should studies on the gender gap count all papers? Perhaps they should weight the papers by some citation indices. Are women writing more impactful papers? What percent of papers by gender have citations rate above X?—you get the idea. </p>
<p>
Finally I wonder if parity is the right goal? <b>How about aiming for more women papers than men</b>? Why not?</p>
<p></p><p><br />

<p>Spring semester is over, yay! To celebrate summer, I’ve compiled lecture notes from the graduate course COS 598D, a.k.a. “<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/optimization4machinelearning/home">optimization for machine learning</a>“.</p>
<p>The course is an aftermath of a few lectures and summer school tutorials given in various locations, in which  lectures goal of the course was to present the most useful methods and ideas in a rigorous-but-not-tedious way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suitable for a mathematically-prepared undergraduate student, and/or researcher beginning their endeavor into machine learning.</li>
<li>Focus on the important: we start with stochastic gradient descent for training deep neural networks.</li>
<li>Bring out the main ideas: i.e. projection-free methods, second-order optimization, the three main acceleration techniques, qualitatively discuss the advantages and applicability of each.</li>
<li>*short* proofs, that everyone can follow and extend in their future research. I prefer being off by a constant/log factor from the best known bound with a more insightful proof.</li>
<li>Not loose track of the goal: generalization/regret, rather than final accuracy. This means we talked about online learning, generalization and precision issues in ML.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is still work in progress, please feel free to send me typos/corrections, as well as other topics you’d like to see (on my todos already: lower bounds, quasi-convexity, and the homotopy method).</p>
<p>Note: zero-order/bandit optimization is an obvious topic that’s not address. The reason is purely subjective – it appears as a chapter in <a href="http://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu/">this textbook</a> (that also started as lecture notes!).</p>

Recently, Bravyi, Gosset, and König (Science, 2018) exhibited a search problem called the 2D Hidden Linear Function (2D HLF) problem that can be solved exactly by a constant-depth quantum circuit using bounded fan-in gates (or QNC^0 circuits), but cannot be solved by any constant-depth classical circuit using bounded fan-in AND, OR, and NOT gates (or NC^0 circuits). In other words, they exhibited a search problem in QNC^0 that is not in NC^0.

We strengthen their result by proving that the 2D HLF problem is not contained in AC^0, the class of classical, polynomial-size, constant-depth circuits over the gate set of unbounded fan-in AND and OR gates, and NOT gates. We also supplement this worst-case lower bound with an average-case result: There exists a simple distribution under which any AC^0 circuit (even of nearly exponential size) has exponentially small correlation with the 2D HLF problem. Our results are shown by constructing a new problem in QNC^0, which we call the Relaxed Parity Halving Problem, which is easier to work with. We prove our AC^0 lower bounds for this problem, and then show that it reduces to the 2D HLF problem.

As a step towards even stronger lower bounds, we present a search problem that we call the Parity Bending Problem, which is in QNC^0/qpoly (QNC^0 circuits that are allowed to start with a quantum state of their choice that is independent of the input), but is not even in AC^0[2] (the class AC^0 with unbounded fan-in XOR gates).

All the quantum circuits in our paper are simple, and the main difficulty lies in proving the classical lower bounds. For this we employ a host of techniques, including a refinement of H{\aa}stad's switching lemmas for multi-output circuits that may be of independent interest, the Razborov-Smolensky AC^0[2] lower bound, Vazirani's XOR lemma, and lower bounds for non-local games.</div>

<div class="content">
<p>As I mentioned in <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/06/20/portland-street-art.html">my previous post</a>, I just finished attending the Symposium on Computational Geometry in Portland. The <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/portals/lipics/index.php?semnr=16108">conference proceedings are open access through LIPIcs</a>.</p>

<p>The conference started on Tuesday (after some earlier social activities) with the best paper talk by Arnaud de Mesmay, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.27">Almost tight lower bounds for hard cutting problems in embedded graphs</a>” (with V. Cohen-Addad, É. Colin de Verdière, and D. Marx) proving that, to find the shortest set of cuts to slice a genus- surface into a disk, the exponent must depend linearly on  (assuming the exponential time hypothesis).</p>

<p>Several of the contributed talks from throughout the conference particularly caught my attention:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Shay Moran’s paper with A. Yehudayoff, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.51">On weak -nets and the Radon number</a>” concerned abstract convexity spaces where the convex sets are any set family closed under intersection. A space has Radon number  if every  points can be partitioned into two subsets whose convex hulls (smallest containing convex sets) intersect, and a point in the intersection is called a Radon point. Having bounded Radon number turns out to be equivalent to having weak -nets, subsets of points that (for a given measure on the space) intersect every large convex set.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mitchell Jones’ “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.41">Journey to the center of the point set</a>” (with Sariel Har-Peled) improved an old paper of mine on using Radon points to find points of high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centerpoint_(geometry)">Tukey depth</a> in high-dimensional point sets in time polynomial in the dimension, improving both the polynomial and the depth of the resulting points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sariel Har-Peled spoke on his work with Timothy Chan, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.23">Smallest -enclosing rectangle revisited</a>”. As well as shaving logs from the time bounds for finding rectangles that enclose a given number of points and minimize their area or perimeter, they found a general reduction from problems on  points to  problems on  points, allowing one to turn factors of  in the time bounds into factors of . Previously such reductions were only known for -point subset problems where the optimal solution lies among the  nearest neighbors of some input point, true for rectangle perimeter but not rectangle area.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Timothy Chan’s “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.20">Computing Shapley values in the plane</a>” concerns an interesting combination of game theory and computational geometry. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_value">Shapley value</a> is a method for assigning credit when multiple people collaborate to produce some value (given as input a function from subsets of people to the value of a subset). It can be defined by adding contributors one-by-one in a random order and setting each contributor’s Shapley value to the expected increase in value when that contributor is added. It sums to the total value and is the unique function with this property that obeys several other natural and desirable axioms for credit assignment. For arbitrary functions from subsets of  contributors to subset values, it takes time  to compute, but Timothy described polynomial time algorithms for cases when the value function has some geometric meaning, such as when it measures the area of the convex hull of a subset of  points. There’s probably a lot more to be done in the same direction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Patrick Schnider’s “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.56">Ham-Sandwich cuts and center transversals in subspaces</a>” has some partial results towards a conjectured generalization of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ham_sandwich_theorem">ham sandwich theorem</a>: given  probability distributions in -dimensional Euclidean space, it should be possible to find  hyperplanes whose checkerboard partition of space simultaneously bisects all of the distributions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jie Xue spoke on “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.60">Near-optimal algorithms for shortest paths in weighted unit-disk graphs</a>” (with Haitao Wang). Here “weighted” means that overlapping unit disks are connected by an edge whose length is the Euclidean distance between their centers. Previous methods obtained near-linear algorithms by using bichromatic closest pair data structures to simulate Dijkstra’s algorithm. Instead, Wang and Xue use a related relaxation algorithm that partitions the plane into a grid and at each step relaxes all edges between certain pairs of grid squares, using data structures for additively weighted nearest neighbors. By avoiding the overhead of closest pairs they shave several logs from the runtime.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arnaud de Mesmay spoke again towards the end of the conference on “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.49">The unbearable hardness of unknotting</a>”, with Yo’av Rieck, Eric Sedgwick, and Martin Tancer. They used a reduction from 3-satisfiability, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_link">Hopf links</a> for variables and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borromean_rings">Borromean links</a> for clauses (connected to each other by ribbons), to prove that it’s NP-complete to find an unlinked subset of a link with a maximum number of components. By a second level of replacement that doubles the strands of each link, they also showed that it’s NP-complete to find the minimum number of crossing changes or of Reidemeister moves to unlink a link or to unknot a knot.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>On Tuesday afternoon I went to the workshop on open problems. After the obligatory open problem session, we debated whether we should collect problems on <a href="https://cs.smith.edu/~jorourke/TOPP/">The Open Problems Project</a>, <a href="http://www.openproblemgarden.org/">The Open Problem Garden</a>, or some new system that, since it doesn’t exist, can be more perfect than anything that does. Then I switched to the Young Researcher’s Forum (unfortunately missing the open problem implementation challenge); at the YRF, my student Daniel Frishberg spoke about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06875">our work on using nearest neighbor chains to speed up greedy algorithms</a>.</p>

<p>The invited talks on Wednesday and Friday were by Sanjoy Dasgupta and Bruce Donald, respectively. Dasgupta spoke on using concepts from geometric data structures to interpret the neural structure of the olfactory system in fruit flies (and hopefully, eventually, vice versa: to use our understanding of neural structures to develop new data structures). For instance, the first three layers of neurons in this system appear to implement an “expand-and-sparsify” data structure that represents low-dimensional normalized vectors by randomly mapping them to much higher dimensional vectors and then listing as a set a smaller number of high-value coordinates. This appears to be closely analogous to known methods for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing">locality-sensitive hashing</a>.  Donald spoke on using geometric methods to represent and infer the shapes of proteins, and to design proteins with desired shapes and functions.</p>

<p>Wednesday evening was the conference banquet, at the famed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Ballroom_(Portland,_Oregon)">Crystal Ballroom</a>, conveniently located near Powell’s Books. Matthew Dickerson showed up (after many years absence from SoCG) and brought some musical family members for a live concert.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/portland/ShakySituation-m.jpg" alt="Marquee for Michael Dickerson and Shaky Situation" style="border-style: solid; border-color: black;" /></p>

<p>On Thursday afternoon I stopped by the workshop on algebraic methods where I had the pleasure of seing Josh Zahl give his talk on a whiteboard instead of using prepared slides. It was on methods for proving bounds on the number of incidences among geometric objects by combining naive bounds based on forbidden complete bipartite subgraphs of the incidence graphs, cuttings of space into smaller regions within which one applies these naive bounds, and cuttings of the objects into pieces in order to make the forbidden subgraphs smaller.</p>

<p>The conference business meeting was also Thursday, and ran very smoothly.
Next year SoCG will be in Zurich; the year after that, in Buffalo. We now have an officially incorporated society, <a href="http://www.computational-geometry.org/society/index.html">The Society for Computational Geometry</a>, so that we can maintain buffer funds for the conference from one year to the next; it will be supported by an increase of $30-$35 in non-student registration fees. And the attendees voted overwhelmingly in favor of both <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~irani/safetoc.html">the SafeTOC anti-harassment guidelines</a> and ensuring and better advertising the availability of childcare at future conferences.</p>

<p>The conference was dedicated to the memory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_M._Pollack">Ricky Pollack</a>, but it also included a celebration on Friday of a living computational geometer: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hershberger">John Hershberger</a>, who led the effort to bring SoCG to Oregon, and turned 60 just before the conference began. Happy birthday, John!</p>

The context is as follows: in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09353" class="liinternal">STOC 2018 paper</a> followed by a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08647" class="liinternal">COLT 2019 paper</a>, the following corruption model was discussed: stochastic bandits, except for <img src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-eda88fce4ab12a676aa4baf036291115_l3.png?resize=14%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="14" alt="C" class="ql-img-inline-formula " /> rounds which are adversarial. The state of the art bounds were of the form: optimal (or almost optimal) stochastic term plus <img src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-189063850ed2dd251e3453bcdf72bb1f_l3.png?resize=30%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="30" alt="K C" class="ql-img-inline-formula " />, and it was mentioned as an open problem whether <img src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a11b6676b92ebe2d33985ebf5d9107fe_l3.png?resize=30%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="30" alt="KC" class="ql-img-inline-formula " /> could be improved to <img src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-eda88fce4ab12a676aa4baf036291115_l3.png?resize=14%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="14" alt="C" class="ql-img-inline-formula " /> (there is a lower bound showing that <img src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-eda88fce4ab12a676aa4baf036291115_l3.png?resize=14%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="14" alt="C" class="ql-img-inline-formula " /> is necessary — when <img src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-7a63a8eb07aa9c2f39df62272d6a867e_l3.png?resize=92%2C20&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="20" width="92" alt="C = O(\sqrt{T})" class="ql-img-inline-formula " />). As was discussed in the comment section, it seemed that indeed this clean best of both worlds approach should certainly shed light on the corruption model. It turns out that this is indeed the case, and a one-line calculation resolves positively the open problem from the COLT paper. The formal result is as follows (recall the notation/definitions from <a href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2019/06/10/amazing-progress-in-adversarially-robust-stochastic-multi-armed-bandits/" class="liinternal">the previous blog post</a>):</p>

<p><em>Proof: In equation (1) let us apply Jensen over the corrupt rounds, this yields a term <img src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-aec148c42036e82bad7bbc28ce4df79f_l3.png?resize=53%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="18" width="53" alt="c \sqrt{K C}" class="ql-img-inline-formula " />.

<p>The sum of the second term on the right hand side is upper bounded by <img src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b9e1680c083d81bc4a40e096a27bda7b_l3.png?resize=109%2C28&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="28" width="109" alt="c^2 \sum_{i \neq i^*} \frac{\log(T)}{2 \Delta_i}" class="ql-img-inline-formula " />.
