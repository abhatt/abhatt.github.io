<div class="content">
We show that any Algebraic Branching Program (ABP) computing the polynomial $\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^n$ has at least $\Omega(n^2)$ vertices. This improves upon the lower bound of $\Omega(n\log n)$, which follows from the classical result of Baur and Strassen [Str73, BS83], and extends the results by Kumar [Kum19], which showed a quadratic lower bound  for $\text{homogeneous}$ ABPs computing the same polynomial.

Our proof relies on a notion of depth reduction which is reminiscent of similar statements in the context of matrix rigidity, and shows that any small enough ABP computing the polynomial $\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^n$ can be depth reduced to essentially a homogeneous ABP of the same size which computes the polynomial $\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^n + \varepsilon(\mathbf{x})$, for a structured ``error polynomial'' $\varepsilon(\mathbf{x})$. To complete the proof, we then observe that the lower bound in [Kum19] is robust enough and continues to hold for all polynomials $\sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^n + \varepsilon(\mathbf{x})$, where  $\varepsilon(\mathbf{x})$ has the appropriate structure.</div>

optimal worstcase behaviour. The paper is inspired by Strict Fibonacci Heaps
[1], where G. S. Brodal, G. Lagogiannis, and R. E. Tarjan implemented the heap
with DecreaseKey and Meld interface in assymptotically optimal worst case times
(based on key comparisons). In the paper [2], the ideas were elaborated and it
was shown that the same asymptotical times could be achieved with a strategy
loosing much less information from previous comparisons. There is big overhead
with maintainance of violation lists in these heaps. We propose simple
alternative reducing this overhead. It allows us to implement fast amortized
Fibonacci heaps, where user could call some methods in variants guaranting
worst case time. If he does so, the heaps are not guaranted to be Fibonacci
until an amortized version of a method is called. Of course we could call worst
case versions all the time, but as there is an overhead with the guarantee,
calling amortized versions is prefered choice if we are not concentrated on
complexity of the separate operation.
</p>
<p>We have shown, we could implement full DecreaseKey-Meld interface, but Meld
interface is not natural for these heaps, so if Meld is not needed, much
simpler implementation suffices. As I don't know application requiring Meld, we
would concentrate on noMeld variant, but we will show the changes could be
applied on Meld including variant as well. The papers [1], [2] shown the heaps
could be implemented on pointer machine model. For fast practical
implementations we would rather use arrays. Our goal is to reduce number of
pointer manipulations. Maintainance of ranks by pointers to rank lists would be
unnecessary overhead.

The Sitting
Closer to Friends than Enemies (SCFE) problem is to find an injection of the
vertex set of a given signed graph into a metric space such that for every pair
of incident edges with different signs the end vertices of the positive edge
are injected closer in the space than the end vertices of the negative edge.
Such an injection is called a valid distance drawing. In this document, we
study the SCFE problem in real trees (also known as $\mathbb{R}$-trees). We
show that a complete signed graph has a valid distance drawing in a real tree
if and only if its subgraph composed of all (and only) its positive edges is
strongly chordal. Furthermore, as an instrumental result, we show that the set
of strongly chordal graphs is equal to the set of graphs with an intersection
model of unit balls, proper balls, and balls in a real tree.

Woodruff</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11368">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>A pseudo-deterministic algorithm is a (randomized) algorithm which, when run
multiple times on the same input, with high probability outputs the same result
on all executions. Classic streaming algorithms, such as those for finding
heavy hitters, approximate counting, $\ell_2$ approximation, finding a nonzero
entry in a vector (for turnstile algorithms) are not pseudo-deterministic. For
example, in the instance of finding a nonzero entry in a vector, for any known
low-space algorithm $A$, there exists a stream $x$ so that running $A$ twice on
$x$ (using different randomness) would with high probability result in two
different entries as the output.
</p>
<p>In this work, we study whether it is inherent that these algorithms output
different values on different executions. That is, we ask whether these
problems have low-memory pseudo-deterministic algorithms. For instance, we show
that there is no low-memory pseudo-deterministic algorithm for finding a
nonzero entry in a vector (given in a turnstile fashion), and also that there
is no low-dimensional pseudo-deterministic sketching algorithm for $\ell_2$
norm estimation. We also exhibit problems which do have low memory
pseudo-deterministic algorithms but no low memory deterministic algorithm, such
as outputting a nonzero row of a matrix, or outputting a basis for the row-span
of a matrix.
</p>
<p>We also investigate multi-pseudo-deterministic algorithms: algorithms which
with high probability output one of a few options. We show the first lower
bounds for such algorithms. This implies that there are streaming problems such
that every low space algorithm for the problem must have inputs where there are
many valid outputs, all with a significant probability of being outputted.

e-commerce, and network security, hotspots are generally considered as a group
of vertices that are tightly connected owing to the similar characteristics,
such as common habits and location proximity. In this paper, we investigate the
formation of hotspots from an alternative perspective that considers the routes
along the network paths as the auxiliary information, and attempt to find the
route hotspots in large labeled networks. A route hotspot is a cohesive
subgraph that is covered by a set of routes, and these routes correspond to the
same sequential pattern consisting of vertices' labels. To the best of our
knowledge, the problem of Finding Route Hotspots in Large Labeled Networks has
not been tackled in the literature. However, it is challenging as counting the
number of hotspots in a network is #P-hard. Inspired by the observation that
the sizes of hotspots decrease with the increasing lengths of patterns, we
prove several anti-monotonicity properties of hotspots, and then develop a
scalable algorithm called FastRH that can use these properties to effectively
prune the patterns that cannot form any hotspots. In addition, to avoid the
duplicate computation overhead, we judiciously design an effective index
structure called RH-Index for storing the hotspot and pattern information
collectively, which also enables incremental updating and efficient query
processing. Our experimental results on real-world datasets clearly demonstrate
the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed methods.

the goal of minimizing the local edge connectivity of the remaining graph from
a given source to a sink. We show hardness of obtaining strictly unicriterion
approximations for this basic vertex interdiction problem. We also introduce
and study a general downgrading variant of the interdiction problem where the
capacity of an arc is a function of the subset of its endpoints that are
downgraded, and the goal is to minimize the downgraded capacity of a minimum
source-sink cut subject to a node downgrading budget. This models the case when
both ends of an arc must be downgraded to remove it, for example.
</p>
<p>For this generalization, we provide a bicriteria $(4,4)$-approximation that
downgrades nodes with total weight at most 4 times the budget and provides a
solution where the downgraded connectivity from the source to the sink is at
most 4 times that in an optimal solution. WE accomplish this with an LP
relaxation and round using a ball-growing algorithm based on the LP values. We
further generalize the downgrading problem to one where each vertex can be
downgraded to one of $k$ levels, and the arc capacities are functions of the
pairs of levels to which its ends are downgraded. We generalize our LP rounding
to get $(4k,4k)$-approximation for this case.

currently available assembled genomes come in a draft form. Such draft genomes
consist of a large number of genomic fragments (scaffolds), whose order and/or
orientation (i.e., strand) in the genome are unknown. There exist various
scaffold assembly methods, which attempt to determine the order and orientation
of scaffolds along the genome chromosomes. Some of these methods (e.g., based
on FISH physical mapping, chromatin conformation capture, etc.) can infer the
order of scaffolds, but not necessarily their orientation. This leads to a
special case of the scaffold orientation problem (i.e., deducing the
orientation of each scaffold) with a known order of the scaffolds.
</p>
<p>We address the problem of orientating ordered scaffolds as an optimization
problem based on given weighted orientations of scaffolds and their pairs
(e.g., coming from pair-end sequencing reads, long reads, or homologous
relations). We formalize this problem using notion of a scaffold graph (i.e., a
graph, where vertices correspond to the assembled contigs or scaffolds and
edges represent connections between them). We prove that this problem is
NP-hard, and present a polynomial-time algorithm for solving its special case,
where orientation of each scaffold is imposed relatively to at most two other
scaffolds. We further develop an FPT algorithm for the general case of the OOS
problem.

the shapes of ordinary objects is key to generating semantically plausible
variations of a given shape, transferring edits from one shape to another, and
many other applications in 3D content creation. The common approach of encoding
shapes as points in a high-dimensional latent feature space suggests treating
shape differences as vectors in that space. Instead, we treat shape differences
as primary objects in their own right and propose to encode them in their own
latent space. In a setting where the shapes themselves are encoded in terms of
fine-grained part hierarchies, we demonstrate that a separate encoding of shape
deltas or differences provides a principled way to deal with inhomogeneities in
the shape space due to different combinatorial part structures, while also
allowing for compactness in the representation, as well as edit abstraction and
transfer. Our approach is based on a conditional variational autoencoder for
encoding and decoding shape deltas, conditioned on a source shape. We
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in multiple shape
modification and generation tasks, and provide comparison and ablation studies
on the PartNet dataset, one of the largest publicly available 3D datasets.

evolutionary history of a given set of species. This leads to (rooted)
phylogenetic trees that "disagree" on triples of species, which we call
"conflict triples". An important subtask of computing consensus trees which is
interesting in its own regard is the enumeration of all conflicts exhibited by
a pair of phylogenetic trees (on the same set of $n$ taxa). As it is possible
that a significant part of the $n^3$ triples are in conflict, the trivial
${\Theta}(n^3)$-time algorithm that checks for each triple whether it
constitutes a conflict, was considered optimal. It turns out, however, that we
can do way better in the case that there are only few conflicts. In particular,
we show that we can enumerate all d conflict triples between a pair of
phylogenetic trees in $O(n + d)$ time. Since any deterministic algorithm has to
spend ${\Theta}(n)$ time reading the input and ${\Theta}(d)$ time writing the
output, no deterministic algorithm can solve this task faster than we do (up to

The
probably most well-known problem if this type is knapsack and many
generalizations of it have been studied in the literature like Two-dimensional
Geometric Knapsack (2DKP) and Unsplittable Flow on a Path (UFP). For the latter
two problems, recently the first polynomial time approximation algorithms with
better approximation ratios than 2 were presented [G\'alvez et al., FOCS
2017][Grandoni et al., STOC 2018].
</p>
<p>In this paper we break the barrier of 2 for the Storage Allocation Problem
(SAP) which is a natural intermediate problem between 2DKP and UFP. We are
given a path with capacitated edges and a set of tasks where each task has a
start vertex, an end vertex, a size, and a profit. We seek to select the most
profitable set of tasks that we can draw as non-overlapping rectangles
underneath the capacity profile of the edges where the height of each rectangle
equals the size of the corresponding task.
</p>
<p>This problem is motivated by settings of allocation resources like memory,
bandwidths, etc. where each request needs a contiguous portion of the resource.
The best known polynomial time approximation algorithm for SAP has an
approximation ratio of 2+epsilon$ [M\"omke and Wiese, ICALP 2015] and no better
quasi-polynomial time algorithm is known. We present a polynomial time (63/32)
&lt; 1.969-approximation algorithm for the case of uniform edge capacities and a
quasi-polynomial time (1.997)-approximation algorithm for non-uniform
quasi-polynomially bounded edge capacities. Finally, we show that under slight
resource augmentation we can obtain approximation ratios of 3/2 + epsilon in
polynomial time and 1 + epsilon in quasi-polynomial time, both for arbitrary
edge capacities.

matroids $\M_{1}=(V,\I_{1})$ and $\M_{2}=(V,\I_{2})$ defined over a common
ground set $V$, compute a set $S\in\I_{1}\cap\I_{2}$ of largest possible
cardinality, denoted by $r$. We consider this problem both in the setting where
each $\M_{i}$ is accessed through an independence oracle, i.e. a routine which
returns whether or not a set $S\in\I_{i}$ in $\indep$ time, and the setting
where each $\M_{i}$ is accessed through a rank oracle, i.e. a routine which
returns the size of the largest independent subset of $S$ in $\M_{i}$ in
$\rank$ time.
</p>
<p>In each setting we provide faster exact and approximate algorithms. Given an
independence oracle, we provide an exact $O(nr\log r \indep)$ time algorithm.
This improves upon the running time of $O(nr^{1.5} \indep)$ due to Cunningham
in 1986 and $\tilde{O}(n^{2} \indep+n^{3})$ due to Lee, Sidford, and Wong in
2015. We also provide two algorithms which compute a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximate
solution to matroid intersection running in times $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5}/\eps^{1.5}
\indep)$ and $\tilde{O}((n^{2}r^{-1}\epsilon^{-2}+r^{1.5}\epsilon^{-4.5})
\indep)$, respectively. These results improve upon the $O(nr/\eps \indep)$-time
algorithm of Cunningham as noted recently by Chekuri and Quanrud.
</p>
<p>Given a rank oracle, we provide algorithms with even better dependence on $n$
and $r$. We provide an $O(n\sqrt{r}\log n \rank)$-time exact algorithm and an
$O(n\epsilon^{-1}\log n \rank)$-time algorithm which obtains a
$(1-\eps)$-approximation to the matroid intersection problem. The former result
improves over the $\tilde{O}(nr \rankt+n^{3})$-time algorithm by Lee, Sidford,
and Wong. The rank oracle is of particular interest as the matroid intersection
problem with this oracle is a special case of the submodular function
minimization problem with an evaluation oracle.

field of applied mathematics with new applications and algorithmic developments
appearing rapidly. Two fundamental computations in this field are persistent
homology and zigzag homology. In this paper, we show how these computations in
the most general case reduce to finding a canonical form of a matrix associated
with a type-A quiver representation, which in turn can be computed using
factorizations of associated matrices. We show how to use arbitrary induced
maps on homology for computation, providing a framework that goes beyond the
capabilities of existing software for topological data analysis. Furthermore,
this framework offers multiple opportunities for parallelization which have not
been previously explored.

(Discrete Mathematics, 2019) proved that for any two point sets
$R$ and $B$ with $|R|=|B|$, the perfect matching that matches points of $R$
with points of $B$, and maximizes the total \emph{squared} Euclidean distance
of the matched pairs, verifies that all the disks induced by the matching have
a common point. Each pair of matched points $p\in R$ and $q\in B$ induces the
disk of smallest diameter that covers $p$ and $q$. Following this research
line, in this paper we consider the perfect matching that maximizes the total
Euclidean distance. First, we prove that this new matching for $R$ and $B$ does
not always ensure the common intersection property of the disks. Second, we
extend the study of this new matching for sets of $2n$ uncolored points in the
plane, where a matching is just a partition of the points into $n$ pairs. As
the main result, we prove that in this case all disks of the matching do have a
common point. This implies a big improvement on a conjecture of Andy Fingerhut
in 1995, about a maximum matching of $2n$ points in the plane.

point is not too sensitive to individual examples in the dataset. Specifically,
we consider the notions of uniform stability (Bousquet and Elisseeff, 2001) and
prediction privacy (Dwork and Feldman, 2018). Previous work on these notions
shows how they can be achieved in the standard PAC model via simple aggregation
of models trained on disjoint subsets of data. Unfortunately, this approach
leads to a significant overhead in terms of sample complexity. Here we
demonstrate several general approaches to stable and private prediction that
either eliminate or significantly reduce the overhead. Specifically, we
demonstrate that for any class $C$ of VC dimension $d$ there exists a
$\gamma$-uniformly stable algorithm for learning $C$ with excess error $\alpha$
using $\tilde O(d/(\alpha\gamma) + d/\alpha^2)$ samples. We also show that this
bound is nearly tight. For $\epsilon$-differentially private prediction we give
two new algorithms: one using $\tilde O(d/(\alpha^2\epsilon))$ samples and
another one using $\tilde O(d^2/(\alpha\epsilon) + d/\alpha^2)$ samples. The
best previously known bounds for these problems are $O(d/(\alpha^2\gamma))$ and
$O(d/(\alpha^3\epsilon))$, respectively.

<p><strong>Scott’s Introduction:</strong> Happy Thanksgiving!  Please join me in giving thanks for the beautiful post below, by friend-of-the-blog <a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~greg/">Greg Kuperberg</a>, which tells a mathematical story that stretches from the 200s BC all the way to Google’s quantum supremacy result last month.</p>



<h2>Archimedes’ other principle and quantum supremacy</h2>



<p>by Greg Kuperberg</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> UC Davis is <a href="https://recruit.ucdavis.edu/JPF03248">hiring in CS theory</a>! Scott offered me free ad space if I wrote a guest post, so here we are.  The position is in all areas of CS theory, including QC theory although the search is not limited to that.</p>



<p>In this post, I wear the hat of a pure mathematician in a box provided by Archimedes.  I thus set aside what everyone else thinks is important about Google’s 53-qubit quantum supremacy experiment, that it is a dramatic milestone in quantum computing technology.  That’s only news about the physical world, whose significance pales in comparison to the Platonic world of mathematical objects.  In my happy world, I like quantum supremacy as a demonstration of a beautiful coincidence in mathematics that has been known for more than 2000 years in a special case. The single-qubit case was discovered by Archimedes, duh.  As Scott mentions in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-since-Democritus-Aaronson/dp/0521199565/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=quantum+computing+since+democritus&amp;qid=1574801358&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em></a>, Bill Wootters stated the general result in a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01883491">1990 paper</a>, but Wootters credits a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01019475">1974 paper</a> by the Czech physicist Stanislav Sýkora.  I learned of it in the substantially more general context of symplectic geometric that mathematicians developed independently between Sýkora’s prescient paper and Wootters’ more widely known citation.  Much as I would like to clobber you with highly abstract mathematics, I will wait for some other time.</p>



<p>Suppose that you pick a pure state \(|\psi\rangle\) in the Hilbert space \(\mathbb{C}^d\) of a \(d\)-dimensional qudit, and then make many copies and fully measure each one, so that you sample many times from some distribution \(\mu\) on the \(d\) outcomes.  You can think of such a distribution \(\mu\) as a classical randomized state on a digit of size \(d\).  The set of all randomized states on a \(d\)-digit makes a \((d-1)\)-dimensional simplex \(\Delta^{d-1}\) in the orthant \(\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^d\).  The coincidence is that if \(|\psi\rangle\) is uniformly random in the unit sphere in \(\mathbb{C}^d\), then \(\mu\) is uniformly random in \(\Delta^{d-1}\).  I will call it the Copenhagen map, since it expresses the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics that amplitudes yield probabilities.  Here is a diagram of the Copenhagen map of a qutrit, except with the laughable simplification of the 5-sphere in \(\mathbb{C}^3\) drawn as a 2-sphere. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/f1-qutrit.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>If you pretend to be a bad probability student, then you might not be surprised by this coincidence, because you might suppose that all probability distributions are uniform other than treacherous exceptions to your intuition.  However, the principle is certainly not true for a “rebit” (a qubit with real amplitudes) or for higher-dimensional “redits.”  With real amplitudes, the probability density goes to infinity at the sides of the simplex \(\Delta^{d-1}\) and is even more favored at the corners.  It also doesn’t work for mixed qudit states; the projection then favors the middle of \(\Delta^{d-1}\). </p>



<h3>Archimedes’ theorem</h3>



<p> The theorem of Archimedes is that a natural projection from the unit sphere to a circumscribing vertical cylinder preserves area.  The projection is the second one that you might think of: Project radially from a vertical axis rather than radially in all three directions.  Since Archimedes was a remarkably prescient mathematician, he was looking ahead to the Bloch sphere of pure qubit states \(|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\) written in density operator form.  If you measure \(|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\) in the computational basis, you get a randomized bit state \(\mu\) somewhere on the interval from guaranteed 0 to guaranteed 1. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/f2-bloch.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>This transformation from a quantum state to a classical randomized state is a linear projection to a vertical axis.  It is the same as Archimedes’ projection, except without the angle information.  It doesn’t preserve dimension, but it does preserve measure (area or length, whatever) up to a factor of \(2\pi\).  In particular, it takes a uniformly random \(|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\) to a uniformly random \(\mu\).</p>



<p>Archimedes’ projection is also known as the Lambert cylindrical map of the world.  This is the map that squishes Greenland along with the top of North America and Eurasia to give them proportionate area. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/f3-lambert.jpg" alt="" /></figure>



<p>(I forgive Lambert if he didn’t give prior credit to Archimedes.  There was no Internet back then to easily find out who did what first.)  Here is a calculus-based proof of Archimedes’ theorem: In spherical coordinates, imagine an annular strip on the sphere at a polar angle of \(\theta\).  (The polar angle is the angle from vertical in spherical coordinates, as depicted in red in the Bloch sphere diagram.)   The strip has a radius of \(\sin\theta\), which makes it shorter than its unit radius friend on the cylinder.  But it’s also tilted from vertical by an angle of \(\frac{\pi}2-\theta\), which makes it wider by a factor of \(1/(\sin \theta)\) than the height of its projection onto the \(z\) axis.  The two factors exactly cancel out, making the area of the strip exactly proportional to the length of its projection onto the \(z\) axis.  This is a coincidence which is special to the 2-sphere in 3 dimensions.  As a corollary, we get that the surface area of a unit sphere is \(4\pi\), the same as an open cylinder with radius 1 and height 2.  If you want to step through this in even more detail, Scott mentioned to me an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNcFjFmqEc8">action video</a> which is vastly spiffier than anything that I could ever make.</p>



<p>The projection of the Bloch sphere onto an interval also shows what goes wrong if you try this with a rebit.  The pure rebit states — again expressed in density operator form \(|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\) are a great circle in the Bloch sphere.  If you linearly project a circle onto an interval, then the length of the circle is clearly bunched up at the ends of the interval and the projected measure on the interval is not uniform. </p>



<h3>Sýkora’s generalization</h3>



<p> It is a neat coincidence that the Copenhagen map of a qubit preserves measure, but a proof that relies on Archimedes’ theorem seems to depend on the special geometry of the Bloch sphere of a qubit.  That the higher-dimensional Copenhagen map also preserves measure is downright eerie.  Scott challenged me to write an intuitive explanation.  I  remembered two different (but similar) proofs, neither of which is original to me. Scott and I disagree as to which proof is nicer.</p>



<p>As a first step of the first proof, it is easy to show that the Copenhagen map \(p = |z|^2\) for a single amplitude \(z\) preserves measure as a function from the complex plane \(\mathbb{C}\) to the ray \(\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}\).  The region in the complex numbers \(\mathbb{C}\) where the length of \(z\) is between \(a\) and \(b\), or \(a \le |z| \le b\), is \(\pi(b^2 – a^2)\).  The corresponding interval for the probability is \(a^2 \le p \le b^2\), which thus has length \(b^2-a^2\).  That’s all, we’ve proved it!  More precisely, the area of any circularly symmetric region in \(\mathbb{C}\) is \(\pi\) times the length of its projection onto \(\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}\). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/f4-washer.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>The second step is to show the same thing for the Copenhagen map from the \(d\)-qudit Hilbert space \(\mathbb{C}^d\) to the \(d\)-digit orthant \(\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^d\), again without unit normalization.  It’s also measure-preserving, up to a factor of \(\pi^d\) this time, because it’s the same thing in each coordinate separately.  To be precise, the volume ratio holds for any region in \(\mathbb{C}^d\) that is invariant under separately rotating each of the \(d\) phases. (Because you can approximate any such region with a union of products of thin annuli.)</p>



<p>The third and final step is the paint principle for comparing surface areas.  If you paint the hoods of two cars with the same thin layer of paint and you used the same volume of paint for each one, then you can conclude that the two car hoods have nearly same area.  In our case, the Copenhagen map takes the region \[ 1 \le |z_0|^2 + |z_1|^2 + \cdots + |z_{d-1}|^2 \le 1+\epsilon \] in \(\mathbb{C}^d\) to the region \[ 1 \le p_0 + p_1 + \cdots + p_{d-1} \le 1+\epsilon \] in the orthant \(\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^d\).  The former is the unit sphere \(S^{2d-1}\) in \(\mathbb{C}^d\) painted to a thickness of roughly \(\epsilon/2\).  The latter is the probability simplex \(\Delta^{n-1}\) painted to a thickness of exactly \(\epsilon\). Taking the limit \(\epsilon \to 0\), the Copenhagen map from \(S^{2d-1}\) to \(\Delta^{n-1}\) preserves measure up to a factor of \(2\pi^n\).</p>



<p>You might wonder “why” this argument works even if you accept that it does work.  The key is that the exponent 2 appears in two different ways: as the dimension of the complex numbers, and as the exponent used to set probabilities and define spheres.  If we try the same argument with real amplitudes, then the volume between “spheres” of radius \(a\) and \(b\) is just \(2(b-a)\), which does not match the length \(b^2-a^2\).  The Copenhagen map for a single real amplitude is the parabola \(p = x^2\), which clearly distorts length since it is not linear.  The higher-dimensional real Copenhagen map similarly distorts volumes, whether or not you restrict to unit-length states.</p>



<p>If you’re a bitter-ender who still wants Archimedes’ theorem for real amplitudes, then you might consider the variant formula \(p = |x|\) to obtain a probability \(p\) from a “quantum amplitude” \(x\).  Then the “Copenhagen” map does preserve measure, but for the trivial reason that \(x = \pm p\) is not really a quantum amplitude, it is a probability with a vestigial sign.  Also the unit “sphere” in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) is not really a sphere in this theory, it is a hyperoctahedron.  The only “unitary” operators that preserve the unit hyperoctahedron are signed permutation matrices.  You can only use them for reversible classical computing or symbolic dynamics; they don’t have the strength of true quantum computing or quantum mechanics.</p>



<p>The fact that the Copenhagen map preserves measure also yields a bonus calculation of the volume of the unit ball in \(2d\) real dimensions, if we interpret that as \(d\) complex dimensions.  The ball \[ |z_0|^2 + |z_1|^2 + \cdots + |z_{d-1}|^2 \le 1 \] in \(\mathbb{C}^d\) is sent to a different simplex \[ p_0 + p_1 + \cdots + p_{d-1} \le 1 \] in \(\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^d\).  If we recall that the volume of a \(d\)-dimensional pyramid is \(\frac1d\) times base times height and calculate by induction on \(d\), we get that this simplex has volume \(\frac1{d!}\).  Thus, the volume of the \(2d\)-dimensional unit ball is \(\frac{\pi^d}{d!}\).</p>



<p>You might ask whether the volume of a \(d\)-dimensional unit ball is always \(\frac{\pi^{d/2}}{(d/2)!}\) for both \(d\) even and odd.  The answer is yes if we interpret factorials using the gamma function formula \(x! = \Gamma(x+1)\) and look up that \(\frac12! = \Gamma(\frac32) = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}2\).  The gamma function was discovered by Euler as a solution to the question of defining fractional factorials, but the notation \(\Gamma(x)\) and the cumbersome shift by 1 is due to Legendre.  Although Wikipedia says that no one knows why Legendre defined it this way, I wonder if his goal was to do what the Catholic church later did for itself in 1978: It put a Pole at the origin.</p>



<p>(Scott wanted to censor this joke. In response, I express my loyalty to my nation of birth by quoting the opening of the Polish national anthem: “Poland has not yet died, so long as we still live!”  I thought at first that Stanislav Sýkora is Polish since Stanisław and Sikora are both common Polish names, but his name has Czech spelling and he is Czech. Well, the Czechs are cool too.)</p>



<p>Sýkora’s 1974 proof of the generalized Archimedes’ theorem is different from this one.  He calculates multivariate moments of the space of unit states \(S^{2d-1} \subseteq \mathbb{C}^d\), and confirms that they match the moments in the probability simplex \(\Delta^{d-1}\).  There are inevitably various proofs of this result, and I will give another one. </p>



<h3>Another proof, and quantum supremacy</h3>



<p>There is a well-known and very useful algorithm to generate a random point on the unit sphere in either \(\mathbb{R}^d\) or \(\mathbb{C}^d\), and a similar algorithm to generate a random point in a simplex.  In the former algorithm, we make each real coordinate \(x\) into an independent Gaussian random variable with density proportional to \(e^{-x^2}\;dx\), and then rescale the result to unit length.  Since the exponents combine as \[ e^{-x_0^2}e^{-x_1^2}\cdots e^{-x_{d-1}^2} =       e^{-(x_0^2 + x_1^2 + \cdots + x_{d-1}^2)}, \] we learn that the total exponent is spherically symmetric.  Therefore after rescaling, the result is a uniformly random point on the unit sphere \(S^{d-1} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d\).  Similarly, the other algorithm generates a point in the orthant \(\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^d\) by making each real coordinate \(p \ge 0\) an independent random variable with exponential distribution \(e^{-p}\;dp\).  This time we rescale the vector until its sum is 1.  This algorithm likewise produces a uniformly random point in the simplex \(\Delta^{d-1} \subseteq \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^d\) because the total exponent of the product \[ e^{-p_0}e^{-p_1}\cdots e^{-p_{d-1}} =       e^{-(p_0 + p_1 + \cdots + p_{d-1})} \] only depends on the sum of the coordinates.  Wootters describes both of these algorithms in his 1990 paper, but instead of relating them to give his own proof of the generalized Archimedes’ theorem, he cites Sýkora.</p>



<p>The gist of the proof is that the Copenhagen map takes the Gaussian algorithm to the exponential algorithm.  Explicitly, the Gaussian probability density for a single complex amplitude \[ z = x+iy = re^{i\theta} \] can be converted from Cartesian to polar coordinate as follows: \[ \frac{e^{-|z|^2}\;dx\;dy}{\pi} = \frac{e^{-r^2}r\;dr\;d\theta}{\pi}. \] I have included the factor of \(r\) that is naturally present in an area integral in polar coordinates.  We will need it, and it is another way to see that the theorem relies on the fact that the complex numbers are two-dimensional.  To complete the proof, we substitute \(p = r^2\) and remember that \(dp = 2r\;dr\), and then integrate over \(\theta\) (trivially, since the integrand does not depend on \(\theta\)).  The density simplifies to \(e^{-p}\;dp\), which is exactly the exponential distribution for a real variable \(p \ge 0\).  Since the Copenhagen map takes the Gaussian algorithm to the exponential algorithm, and since each algorithm produces a uniformly random point, the Copenhagen map must preserve uniform measure.  (Scott likes this proof better because it is algorithmic, and because it is probabilistic.)</p>



<p>Now about quantum supremacy.  You might think that a random chosen quantum circuit on \(n\) qubits produces a nearly uniformly random quantum state \(|\psi\rangle\) in their joint Hilbert space, but it’s not quite not that simple.  When \(n=53\), or otherwise as \(n \to \infty\), a manageable random circuit is not nearly creative enough to either reach or approximate most of the unit states in the colossal Hilbert space of dimension \(d = 2^n\).  The state \(|\psi\rangle\) that you get from (say) a polynomial-sized circuit resembles a fully random state in various statistical and computational respects, both proven and conjectured.  As a result, if you measure the qubits in the computational basis, you get a randomized state on \(n\) bits that resembles a uniformly random point in \(\Delta^{2^n-1}\).</p>



<p>If you choose \(d\) probabilities, and if each one is an independent exponential random variable, then the law of large numbers says that the sum (which you use for rescaling) is close to \(d\) when \(d\) is large. When \(d\) is really big like \(2^{53}\), a histogram of the probabilities of the bit strings of a supremacy experiment looks like an exponential curve \(f(p) \propto e^{-pd}\).  In a sense, the statistical distribution of the bit strings is almost the same almost every time, independent of which random quantum circuit you choose to generate them.  The catch is that the position of any given bit string does depend on the circuit and is highly scrambled.  I picture it in my mind like this: </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/f5-samples.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>

It is thought to be computationally intractable to calculate where each bit string lands on this exponential curve, or even where just one of them does.  (The exponential curve is attenuated by noise in the actual experiment, but it’s the same principle.)  That is one reason that random quantum circuits are supreme.</p>

randomized decoding algorithm that, given an index $i$ and a received word $w$
close to an encoding of a message $x$, outputs $x_i$ by querying only at most
$q$ coordinates of $w$. Understanding the tradeoffs between the dimension,
length and query complexity of LDCs is a fascinating and unresolved research
challenge. In particular, for $3$-query binary LDCs of dimension $k$ and length
$n$, the best known bounds are: $2^{k^{o(1)}} \geq n \geq \tilde{\Omega}(k^2)$.
</p>
<p>In this work, we take a second look at binary $3$-query LDCs. We investigate
a class of 3-uniform hypergraphs that are equivalent to strong binary 3-query
LDCs. We prove an upper bound on the number of edges in these hypergraphs,
reproducing the known lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(k^2)$ for the length of
strong $3$-query LDCs. In contrast to previous work, our techniques are purely
combinatorial and do not rely on a direct reduction to $2$-query LDCs, opening
up a potentially different approach to analyzing 3-query LDCs.

<p><b>Authors: </b>Noujan Pashanasangi, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Seshadhri:C=.html">C. Seshadhri</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.10616">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>Subgraph counting is a fundamental task in network analysis. Typically,
algorithmic work is on total counting, where we wish to count the total
frequency of a (small) pattern subgraph in a large input data set. But many
applications require local counts (also called vertex orbit counts) wherein,
for every vertex $v$ of the input graph, one needs the count of the pattern
subgraph involving $v$. This provides a rich set of vertex features that can be
used in machine learning tasks, especially classification and clustering. But
getting local counts is extremely challenging. Even the easier problem of
getting total counts has received much research attention. Local counts require
algorithms that get much finer grained information, and the sheer output size
makes it difficult to design scalable algorithms.
</p>
<p>We present EVOKE, a scalable algorithm that can determine vertex orbits
counts for all 5-vertex pattern subgraphs. In other words, EVOKE exactly
determines, for every vertex $v$ of the input graph and every 5-vertex subgraph
$H$, the number of copies of $H$ that $v$ participates in. EVOKE can process
graphs with tens of millions of edges, within an hour on a commodity machine.
EVOKE is typically hundreds of times faster than previous state of the art
algorithms, and gets results on datasets beyond the reach of previous methods.
</p>
<p>Theoretically, we generalize a recent "graph cutting" framework to get vertex
orbit counts. This framework generate a collection of polynomial equations
relating vertex orbit counts of larger subgraphs to those of smaller subgraphs.
EVOKE carefully exploits the structure among these equations to rapidly count.
We prove and empirically validate that EVOKE only has a small constant factor
overhead over the best (total) 5-vertex subgraph counter.

Lock proposed five variants of the graph coloring game and left open the
question of PSPACE-hardness related to them. In this paper, we prove that these

signal for further analysis of foundational roots of (possible) superiority of
some quantum algorithms over the corresponding classical algorithms. This note
is a step in this direction. We start with critical analysis of rather common
reference to entanglement and quantum nonlocality as the basic sources of
quantum superiority. We elevate the role of the Bohr's {\it principle of
complementarity}\footnote{} (PCOM) by interpreting the Bell-experiments as
statistical tests of this principle. (Our analysis also includes comparison of
classical vs genuine quantum entanglements.) After a brief presentation of PCOM
and endowing it with the information interpretation, we analyze its
computational counterpart. The main implication of PCOM is that by using the
quantum representation of probability, one need not compute the joint
probability distribution (jpd) for observables involved in the process of
computation. Jpd's calculation is exponentially time consuming. Consequently,
classical probabilistic algorithms involving calculation of jpd for $n$ random
variables can be over-performed by quantum algorithms (for big values of $n).$
Quantum algorithms are based on quantum probability calculus. It is crucial
that the latter modifies the classical formula of total probability (FTP).
Probability inference based on the quantum version of FTP leads to constructive
interference of probabilities increasing probabilities of some events. We also
stress the role the basic feature of the genuine quantum superposition
comparing with the classical wave superposition: generation of discrete events
in measurements on superposition states. Finally, the problem of superiority of
quantum computations is coupled with the quantum measurement problem and
linearity of dynamics of the quantum state update.

result provides a surprising converse to known lower bounds against all linear
programming relaxations of Max-Cut, and hence resolves the extension complexity
of approximate Max-Cut for approximation factors close to $\frac{1}{2}$ (up to
the function $\varepsilon'(\varepsilon)$). Previously, only semidefinite
programs and spectral methods were known to yield approximation factors better
than $\frac 12$ for Max-Cut in time $2^{o(n)}$. We also separate the power of
Sherali-Adams versus Lovasz-Schrijver hierarchies for approximating Max-Cut,
since it is known that $(\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon)$ approximation of Max Cut
requires $\Omega_\varepsilon (n)$ rounds in the Lovasz-Schrijver hierarchy.

<p>We also provide a subexponential time approximation for Khot's Unique Games

some $\varepsilon'( \varepsilon) &gt;0$, where $q$ is the alphabet size. Such
guarantees are qualitatively similar to those of previous subexponential-time
algorithms for Unique Games but our algorithm does not rely on semidefinite
programming or subspace enumeration techniques.

<div class="content">
<p>I talked briefly about how to get from one 3-coloring of a grid graph to another by changing one vertex color at a time, in <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/10/16/from-one-fold.html">a recent blog post about analogous problems for origami folding patterns</a>. It turns out that this problem of reconfiguring 3-colorings has been treated in much greater generality in the 2007 doctoral dissertation of Luis Cereceda, “<a href="http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/131/">Mixing graph colourings</a>”, as I discovered when I read the dissertation in the process of writing a new Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereceda%27s_conjecture">Cereceda’s conjecture</a>, the conjecture that the space of -colorings of -degenerate graphs (under moves that change the color of one vertex at a time) has at most quadratic diameter. Here’s an illustration from the new article showing the space of 3-colorings of a path graph:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/path-3-colorings.svg" alt="The space of 3-colorings of a path graph" /></p>

<p>Cereceda proved that the following properties of a graph are equivalent:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It has a connected space of 3-colorings.</li>
  <li>Every 3-coloring has a height function.</li>
  <li>It is bipartite and does not have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_homomorphism">retraction</a> onto a 6-cycle.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we consider the three colors to be used for 3-colorings to be the numbers 0, 1, and 2 (mod 3) then a height function can be defined as an assignment of integers (not mod 3) to the vertices, such that taking them mod 3 produces the given coloring, and such that adjacent vertices have heights that differ by . If it exists for a given coloring, it can be constructed easily by choosing the height of one vertex arbitrarily and then using the  requirement for adjacent heights to propagate this choice to neighbors in the graph until every vertex has a height. What can go wrong is that this propagation somehow leaves two adjacent vertices with heights that are too far apart. For instance, if the colors around a 6-cycle have the cyclic order 0–1–2–0–1–2 then you will come back to the start six units higher than you started.</p>

<p>Continuing to explain the terms in Cereceda’s equivalence, a retraction is a mapping from the vertices of the given graph onto a 6-cycle subgraph of the same graph, with the property that adjacent vertices of the graph are mapped to adjacent vertices of the 6-cycle. When a retraction exists, any coloring of the 6-cycle can be pulled back to a coloring of the original graph (coloring each vertex with the color of the 6-cycle vertex it is mapped to), and the bad 3-coloring of the 6-cycle described above leads to a bad 3-coloring of the original graph. But this turns out to be the only thing that can go wrong.</p>

<p>It’s also possible to construct in polynomial time the shortest sequence of color changes to go from one 3-coloring to another, whenever the space of colorings is connected. Cereceda almost finds this algorithm but misses a small trick and ends up stating its existence only as a conjecture. As I explained in my previous post, if you choose the correct offset for the height functions of the two colorings, you can find this shortest sequence by greedily changing the color at a vertex of one color where the current height is farthest from the goal height. The trick that Cereceda misses is that if you don’t know the correct offset between the two height functions, you can just try them all (or more quickly use a median algorithm to find the optimal offset and the distance between colorings in linear time).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as Cereceda proved, finding a retraction onto a 6-cycle is -complete and therefore testing the connectivity of the space of 3-colorings (and the applicability of the height-based shortest reconfiguration algorithm) is -complete. For instance, I’m pretty sure the 10-vertex Möbius ladder shown below has height functions for all its 3-colorings, and does not have a retraction onto a 6-cycle, but I don’t know of an elegant way to prove this, and -completeness suggests that not all graphs have elegant proofs for this. This graph has lots of 6-cycles, for instance formed by any diagonal and the path around the outer cycle connecting its two endpoints. But trying to produce a retraction by folding it flat across a diagonal doesn’t work because it would map some edges to non-edges, and nothing else seems to work either.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/M%C3%B6bius-ladder-10.svg" alt="A 10-vertex Möbius ladder" /></p>

<p>To save this post from being content-free, I want to describe a more easily recognized family of graphs that meets Cereceda’s criterion, and does have height functions for all its 3-colorings (so we can quickly find the shortest reconfiguration sequences in these graphs). It is the class of graphs in which the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_space">cycle space</a> is generated by the 4-cycles, or in other words the graphs in which there exists a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_basis">cycle basis</a> consisting only of 4-cycles. These graphs can be recognized simply by doing some mod-2 linear algebra to test whether the space generated by the 4-cycles has the same dimension as the cycle space. For instance, the Möbius ladder above is not in this class because the dimension of its cycle space (the number of edges beyond the ones in a spanning forest) is six but its number of 4-cycles (the cycles between two consecutive diagonals) is only five. Despite this example, the graphs generated by 4-cycles include a lot of natural classes of graphs that we might want to reconfigure 3-colorings of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trees</li>
  <li>Rectangular grid graphs and higher-dimensional hyperrectangular grid graphs</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaregraph">Squaregraphs</a></li>
  <li>The dual graphs of simple line arrangements</li>
  <li>Complete bipartite graphs</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chordal_bipartite_graph">Chordal bipartite graphs</a></li>
  <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product_of_graphs">Cartesian products</a> of other graphs generated by 4-cycles</li>
</ul>

<p>To prove that Cartesian products preserve the property of being generated by 4-cycles, consider any cycle  in the product graph; we want to represent it as a mod-2 sum of 4-cycles. If two consecutive edges of  come from the two different factors, then the product of these edges is a 4-cycle, and adding this 4-cycle to  swaps the order of the two edges within . By repeated swaps we can segregate all the edges from the two factors from each other, changing  into two cycles, one from each factor, that meet at a common vertex. Then we can represent the two cycles separately within the two factors.</p>

<p>It’s straightforward to see that when 4-cycles generate the -homology of a graph, then height functions always exist, because the height difference around any cycle is the sum of the height differences of the 4-cycles generating it, which are all zero. But here by using the binary cycle space we’re looking at the -homology, which might be a different thing. There could be graphs whose -homology is generated by 4-cycles but whose -homology isn’t. For instance I think that adding one bipartite edge to the 10-vertex Möbius ladder produces an example of this phenomenon. So we need a proof that -homology is good enough. Or in simpler terms, when the cycle space is generated by 4-cycles, all 3-colorings have height functions.</p>

<p>We’ll prove this by contradiction, so let’s suppose that we have the smallest possible counterexample. That is, we have a graph , a 3-coloring of , and a cycle  in , such that the cycle space of  is generated by 4-cycles but going around  using the  rule to propagate heights produces a different height than you started with. By “smallest” I mean first, that  is as short as possible, second, that for that length of  the rest of  has as few vertices as possible, and third, that the number of 4-cycles in the representation of  is as small as possible.</p>

<p>Then  cannot have any chords, because if it did then a chord plus one of the two segments of  connecting the chord endpoints would form a shorter cycle with the same inconsistent heights. Because we are assuming that  is generated by 4-cycles, consider any set  of 4-cycles whose sum is . That is, each edge of  appears an odd number of times in cycles of , and each other edge of  appears an even number of times (possibly zero). Each 4-cycle in  must have a coloring of the form ––– or ––– for some colors , , and . If at least one of the two -colored vertices does not belong to , form a smaller graph  by merging these two -colored vertices. This merger does not change  or the coloring, so  stays a bad cycle. And it doesn’t change the property of  that it is generated by 4-cycles, because any cycle in the merged graph can be lifted to a cycle in the unmerged graph (possibly passing through –– in the merged 4-cycle and possibly not simple), represented by 4-cycles in  itself, and then merged back down to get a representation in the smaller graph. But because we’re assuming  was the smallest possible counterexample, this shrinkage can’t happen, so all of the 4-cycles in  have both -vertices in .</p>

<p>Now if we have a 4-cycle with two -vertices in , at least one of the other two vertices does not belong to , because  must be longer than four edges (else it would not have a bad coloring) and we’ve already ruled out the possibility that  has the chords that would be needed to make a 4-cycle using vertices only from . Let  be this vertex outside of , so we have a path –– connecting the two -vertices in . One of two things can happen: First, the two -vertices might only be two units apart in . But then, replacing the two-edge path between them by the path through  produces a new bad cycle of the same length, in the same graph , representable by a smaller set of 4-cycles. This contradicts our choice of  and  as being the smallest possible counterexample. Second, when the two -vertices are farther apart in , there are two cycles formed by path –– and by one of the two paths in  connecting the same two -vertices. Both of these cycles are shorter than , and at least one of them continues to have a bad coloring. So again we have found a smaller counterexample and a contradiction.</p>

<p>This case analysis leading in all cases to a contradiction shows that a smallest counterexample cannot exist, and therefore that all graphs generated by 4-cycles have height functions for all of their 3-colorings.</p>

The Exponential-Time Hypothesis ($ETH$) is a strengthening of the $\mathcal{P} \neq \mathcal{NP}$ conjecture, stating that $3\text{-}SAT$ on $n$ variables cannot be solved in time $2^{\epsilon\cdot n}$, for some $\epsilon&gt;0$. In recent years, analogous hypotheses that are ``exponentially-strong'' forms of other classical complexity conjectures (such as $\mathcal{NP}\not\subseteq\mathcal{BPP}$ or $co\text{-}\mathcal{NP}\not\subseteq \mathcal{NP}$) have also been considered. These Exponential-Time Hypotheses have been widely influential across different areas of complexity theory. However, their connections to *derandomization and circuit lower bounds* have yet to be systematically studied. Such study is indeed the focus of the current work, and we prove a sequence of results demonstrating that *the connections between exponential-time hypotheses, derandomization, and circuit lower bounds are remarkably strong*.

First, we show that if $3\text{-}SAT$ (or even $TQBF$) cannot be solved by probabilistic algorithms that run in time $2^{n/\mathrm{polylog}(n)}$, then $\mathcal{BPP}$ can be deterministically simulated ``on average case'' in (nearly-)polynomial-time (i.e., in time $n^{\mathrm{polyloglog}(n)}$). This result addresses a long-standing lacuna in uniform ``hardness-to-randomness'' results, which did not previously extend to such parameter settings. Moreover, we extend this result to support an ``almost-always'' derandomization conclusion from an ``almost-always'' lower bound hypothesis.

Secondly, we show that *disproving* certain exponential-time hypotheses requires proving breakthrough circuit lower bounds. In particular, if $CircuitSAT$ for circuits over $n$ bits of size $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ can be solved by *probabilistic algorithms* in time $2^{n/\mathrm{polylog}(n)}$, then $\mathcal{BPE}$ does not have circuits of quasilinear size. The main novel feature of this result is that we only assume the existence of a *randomized* circuit-analysis algorithm, whereas previous similar results crucially relied on the hypothesis that the circuit-analysis algorithm does not use randomness.

Thirdly, we show that a very weak exponential-time hypothesis is closely-related to the classical question of whether derandomization and circuit lower bounds are *equivalent*. Specifically, we show two-way implications between the hypothesis that the foregoing equivalence holds and the hypothesis that $\mathcal{E}$ cannot be decided by ``small'' circuits that are *uniformly generated* by relatively-efficient non-deterministic machines. This highlights a sufficient-and-necessary path for progress towards proving that derandomization and circuit lower bounds are indeed equivalent.</div>
