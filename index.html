We study the fundamental challenge of exhibiting explicit functions that have small correlation with low-degree polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_{2}$. Our main contributions include:

1. In STOC 2020, CHHLZ introduced a new technique to prove correlation bounds. Using their technique they established new correlation bounds for low-degree polynomials. They conjectured that their technique generalizes to higher degree polynomials as well. We give a counterexample to their conjecture, in fact ruling out weaker parameters and showing what they prove is essentially the best possible. 

2. We advocate an alternative approach for proving correlation bounds with the central “mod functions,” consisting of proving two steps: (I) the polynomials that maximize correlation are symmetric, and (II) symmetric polynomials have small correlation. Contrary to related results in the literature, we conjecture that (I) is true. We argue that this approach is not affected by existing “barrier results.”

3. We prove our conjecture for quadratic polynomials. Specifically, we determine the maximum possible correlation between quadratic polynomials modulo 2 and the functions $(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})\to z^{\sum x_{i}}$ for any $z$ on the complex unit circle; and show that it is achieved by symmetric polynomials. To obtain our results we develop a new proof technique: we express correlation in terms of directional derivatives and analyze it by slowly restricting the direction.

4. We make partial progress on the conjecture for cubic polynomials, in particular proving tight correlation bounds for cubic polynomials whose degree-3 part is symmetric.</div>

if for any two vertices $u,v \in V(G)$, there exists a vertex $w \in S$ such
that $d(w,u) \neq d(w,v)$. The {\sc Metric Dimension} problem takes as input a
graph $G$ and a positive integer $k$, and asks whether there exists a resolving
set of size at most $k$. This problem was introduced in the 1970s and is known
to be NP-hard~[GT~61 in Garey and Johnson's book]. In the realm of
parameterized complexity, Hartung and Nichterlein~[CCC~2013] proved that the
problem is W[2]-hard when parameterized by the natural parameter $k$. They also
observed that it is FPT when parameterized by the vertex cover number and asked
about its complexity under \emph{smaller} parameters, in particular the
feedback vertex set number. We answer this question by proving that {\sc Metric
Dimension} is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the feedback vertex set number.
This also improves the result of Bonnet and Purohit~[IPEC 2019] which states
that the problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by the treewidth. Regarding the
parameterization by the vertex cover number, we prove that {\sc Metric
Dimension} does not admit a polynomial kernel under this parameterization
unless $NP\subseteq coNP/poly$. We observe that a similar result holds when the
parameter is the distance to clique. On the positive side, we show that {\sc
Metric Dimension} is FPT when parameterized by either the distance to cluster
or the distance to co-cluster, both of which are smaller parameters than the
vertex cover number.

disjoint simply-connected closed regions and a one-to-one mapping of the
vertices of $G$ to points such that two vertices are adjacent in $G$ if and
only if the line segment connecting the two corresponding points does not
intersect any obstacle. The obstacle number of a graph is the smallest number
of obstacles in an obstacle representation of the graph in the plane such that
all obstacles are simple polygons.
</p>
<p>It is known that the obstacle number of each $n$-vertex graph is $O(n \log
n)$ [Balko, Cibulka, and Valtr, 2018] and that there are $n$-vertex graphs
whose obstacle number is $\Omega(n/(\log\log n)^2)$ [Dujmovi\'c and Morin,
2015]. We improve this lower bound to $\Omega(n/\log\log n)$ for simple
polygons and to $\Omega(n)$ for convex polygons.
</p>
<p>To obtain these stronger bounds, we improve known estimates on the number of
$n$-vertex graphs with bounded obstacle number, solving a conjecture by
Dujmovi\'c and Morin. We also show that if the drawing of some $n$-vertex graph
is given as part of the input, then for some drawings $\Omega(n^2)$ obstacles
are required to turn them into an obstacle representation of the graph. Our
bounds are asymptotically tight in several instances.
</p>
<p>We complement these combinatorial bounds by two complexity results. First, we
show that computing the obstacle number of a graph $G$ is fixed-parameter
tractable in the vertex cover number of $G$. Second, we show that, given a
graph $G$ and a simple polygon $P$, it is NP-hard to decide whether $G$ admits
an obstacle representation using $P$ as the only obstacle.

data: (i) $\textit{verification}$, where the task is to check if a purported
causal graph is correct, and (ii) $\textit{search}$, where the task is to
recover the correct causal graph. For both, we wish to minimize the number of
interventions performed. For the first problem, we give a characterization of a
minimal sized set of atomic interventions that is necessary and sufficient to
check the correctness of a claimed causal graph. Our characterization uses the
notion of $\textit{covered edges}$, which enables us to obtain simple proofs
and also easily reason about earlier results. We also generalize our results to
the settings of bounded size interventions and node-dependent interventional
costs. For all the above settings, we provide the first known provable
algorithms for efficiently computing (near)-optimal verifying sets on general
graphs. For the second problem, we give a simple adaptive algorithm based on
graph separators that produces an atomic intervention set which fully orients
any essential graph while using $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ times the optimal number
of interventions needed to $\textit{verify}$ (verifying size) the underlying
DAG on $n$ vertices. This approximation is tight as $\textit{any}$ search
algorithm on an essential line graph has worst case approximation ratio of
$\Omega(\log n)$ with respect to the verifying size. With bounded size
interventions, each of size $\leq k$, our algorithm gives an $\mathcal{O}(\log
n \cdot \log \log k)$ factor approximation. Our result is the first known
algorithm that gives a non-trivial approximation guarantee to the verifying
size on general unweighted graphs and with bounded size interventions.

learning-augmented online algorithm which incorporates predictions in a

<p>In this study, we particularly begin investigating the classical online

actual request in the OLTSP, associated with its arrival time and position, may
not coincide with the predicted ones, which, as imagined, leads to a
troublesome situation. Our main result is to study different prediction models
and design algorithms to improve the best-known results in the different
settings. Moreover, we generalize the proposed results to the online
dial-a-ride problem.

The intermediate shapes gradually reduce the Hausdorff distance to the goal

conceptually simple and apply to shapes with multiple components and/or holes.
We prove some basic properties relating to continuity, containment, and area.
Then we give an experimental analysis that includes the two new morphs and a
recently introduced abstract morph that is also based on the Hausdorff distance
(Van Kreveld et al. Between shapes, using the Hausdorff distance. Computational

development throughout the morph, and also the number of components and holes.

Each
vertex $s\in S$ is a server with individual capacity $b_s$. The vertices $r\in
R$ are requests that arrive online and must be assigned instantly to an
eligible server. The goal is to maximize the size of the constructed matching.
We assume that $G$ is a $(k,d)$-graph~\cite{NW}, where $k$ specifies a lower
bound on the degree of each server and $d$ is an upper bound on the degree of
each request. This setting models matching problems in timely applications.
</p>
<p>We present tight upper and lower bounds on the performance of deterministic
online algorithms. In particular, we develop a new online algorithm via a
primal-dual analysis. The optimal competitive ratio tends to~1, for arbitrary
$k\geq d$, as the server capacities increase. Hence, nearly optimal solutions
can be computed online. Our results also hold for the vertex-weighted problem
extension, and thus for AdWords and auction problems in which each bidder
issues individual, equally valued bids.
</p>
<p>Our bounds improve the previous best competitive ratios. The asymptotic
competitiveness of~1 is a significant improvement over the previous factor of
$1-1/e^{k/d}$, for the interesting range where $k/d\geq 1$ is small. Recall
that $1-1/e\approx 0.63$. Matching problems that admit a competitive ratio
arbitrarily close to~1 are rare. Prior results rely on randomization or
probabilistic input models.

with probability 1 asynchronously, even against an omniscient, computationally
unbounded adversary that can adaptively \emph{corrupt} up to $f&lt;n/3$ parties.
Moreover, the problem is insoluble with $f\geq n/3$ corruptions. However,
Bracha's 1984 protocol achieved $f&lt;n/3$ resilience at the cost of exponential
expected latency $2^{\Theta(n)}$, a bound that has never been improved in this
model with $f=\lfloor (n-1)/3 \rfloor$ corruptions.
</p>
<p>In this paper we prove that Byzantine Agreement in the asynchronous, full
information model can be solved with probability 1 against an adaptive
adversary that can corrupt $f&lt;n/3$ parties, while incurring only polynomial
latency with high probability. Our protocol follows earlier polynomial latency
protocols of King and Saia and Huang, Pettie, and Zhu, which had suboptimal
resilience, namely $f \approx n/10^9$ and $f&lt;n/4$, respectively.
</p>
<p>Resilience $f=(n-1)/3$ is uniquely difficult as this is the point at which
the influence of the Byzantine and honest players are of roughly equal
strength. The core technical problem we solve is to design a collective
coin-flipping protocol that eventually lets us flip a coin with an unambiguous
outcome. In the beginning the influence of the Byzantine players is too
powerful to overcome and they can essentially fix the coin's behavior at will.
We guarantee that after just a polynomial number of executions of the
coin-flipping protocol, either (a) the Byzantine players fail to fix the
behavior of the coin (thereby ending the game) or (b) we can ``blacklist''
players such that the blacklisting rate for Byzantine players is at least as
large as the blacklisting rate for good players. The blacklisting criterion is
based on a simple statistical test of fraud detection.

satisfying assignments in the random $k$-SAT model when the density of the
formula scales exponentially with $k$. The best previously known sampling
algorithm for the random $k$-SAT model applies when the density $\alpha=m/n$ of
the formula is less than $2^{k/300}$ and runs in time $n^{\exp(\Theta(k))}$
(Galanis, Goldberg, Guo and Yang, SIAM J. Comput., 2021). Here $n$ is the
number of variables and $m$ is the number of clauses. Our algorithm achieves a
significantly faster running time of $n^{1 + o_k(1)}$ and samples satisfying
assignments up to density $\alpha\leq 2^{rk}$ for $r = 0.1402$.
</p>
<p>The main challenge in our setting is the presence of many variables with
unbounded degree, which causes significant correlations within the formula and
impedes the application of relevant Markov chain methods from the
bounded-degree setting (Feng, Guo, Yin and Zhang, J. ACM, 2021; Jain, Pham and
Vuong, 2021). Our main technical contribution is a novel approach to bound the
sum of influences in the $k$-SAT model which turns out to be robust against the
presence of high-degree variables. This allows us to apply the spectral
independence framework and obtain fast mixing results of a uniform-block
Glauber dynamics on a carefully selected subset of the variables. The final key
ingredient in our method is to take advantage of the sparsity of
logarithmic-sized connected sets and the expansion properties of the random
formula, and establish relevant properties of the set of satisfying assignments
that enable the fast simulation of this Glauber dynamics.

most well-studied computational problems in Computer Science. While neither
problem is thought to be in $\texttt{PTIME},$ much work is done on
$\texttt{PTIME}$ approximations to both problems. Two such historically
important approximations are the $k$-consistency algorithm for CSP and the
$k$-Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm for SI, both of which are based on propagating
local partial solutions. The limitations of these algorithms are well-known;
$k$-consistency can solve precisely those CSPs of bounded width and
$k$-Weisfeiler-Leman can only distinguish structures which differ on properties
definable in $C^k$. In this paper, we introduce a novel sheaf-theoretic
approach to CSP and SI and their approximations. We show that both problems can
be viewed as deciding the existence of global sections of presheaves,
$\mathcal{H}_k(A,B)$ and $\mathcal{I}_k(A,B)$ and that the success of the
$k$-consistency and $k$-Weisfeiler-Leman algorithms correspond to the existence
of certain efficiently computable subpresheaves of these. Furthermore, building
on work of Abramsky and others in quantum foundations, we show how to use
\v{C}ech cohomology in $\mathcal{H}_k(A,B)$ and $\mathcal{I}_k(A,B)$ to detect
obstructions to the existence of the desired global sections and derive new
efficient cohomological algorithms extending $k$-consistency and
$k$-Weisfeiler-Leman. We show that cohomological $k$-consistency can solve
systems of equations over all finite rings and that cohomological
Weisfeiler-Leman can distinguish positive and negative instances of the
Cai-F\"urer-Immerman property over several important classes of structures.

computing under uncertainty in which an algorithm can query unknown data. Our
aim is to minimize the number of queries needed to solve the minimum spanning
tree problem, a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem that has been
central also to the research area of explorable uncertainty. For all integral
$\gamma\ge 2$, we present algorithms that are $\gamma$-robust and
$(1+\frac{1}{\gamma})$-consistent, meaning that they use at most $\gamma OPT$
queries if the predictions are arbitrarily wrong and at most
$(1+\frac{1}{\gamma})OPT$ queries if the predictions are correct, where $OPT$
is the optimal number of queries for the given instance. Moreover, we show that
this trade-off is best possible. Furthermore, we argue that a suitably defined
hop distance is a useful measure for the amount of prediction error and design
algorithms with performance guarantees that degrade smoothly with the hop
distance. We also show that the predictions are PAC-learnable in our model. Our
results demonstrate that untrusted predictions can circumvent the known lower
bound of~$2$, without any degradation of the worst-case ratio. To obtain our
results, we provide new structural insights for the minimum spanning tree
problem that might be useful in the context of query-based algorithms
regardless of predictions. In particular, we generalize the concept of witness
sets -- the key to lower-bounding the optimum -- by proposing novel global
witness set structures and completely new ways of adaptively using those.

complexity theory. In the quantum case, every elementary gate must be unitary.
This restriction makes it unclear whether the power of space-bounded
computation changes by allowing intermediate measurement. In the bounded error
case, Fefferman and Remscrim [STOC 2021, pp.1343--1356] and Girish, Raz and
Zhan~[ICALP 2021, pp.73:1--73:20] recently provided the break-through results
that the power does not change. This paper shows that a similar result holds
for space-bounded quantum computation with postselection. Namely, it is proved
possible to eliminate intermediate postselections and measurements in the
space-bounded quantum computation in the bounded-error setting. Our result
strengthens the recent result by Le Gall, Nishimura and Yakaryilmaz~[TQC 2021,
pp.10:1--10:17] that logarithmic-space bounded-error quantum computation with
intermediate postselections and measurements is equivalent in computational
power to logarithmic-space unbounded-error probabilistic computation. As an
application, it is shown that bounded-error space-bounded one-clean qubit
computation (DQC1) with postselection is equivalent in computational power to
unbounded-error space-bounded probabilistic computation, and the computational
supremacy of the bounded-error space-bounded DQC1 is interpreted in
complexity-theoretic terms.

city logistics and manufacturing environments, due to its direct relevance to
operational cost. Most existing literature have investigated the conventional
3D-BPP, in which the shape of items are typically considered as regular shapes,
e.g., rectangular-shaped rigid boxes or cylindrical-shaped containers. However,
3D-BPP for non-rectangular shaped items are quite common in varies delivery
schemes, especially in fresh food delivery, and few published studies focusing
on these issues. In this paper, we address a novel 3D-BPP variant in which the
shape changing factor of non-rectangular and deformable items is incorporated
to further enhance the loading efficiency and reduce the operational cost of
related companies. Motivated by the compression process of item-loading, we
propose a constructive heuristic (i.e., an improved dynamic-volume-based
packing algorithm) to solve the studied problem. Experimental results over a
set of randomly generated instances reveal that considering shape changing
factor is indeed able to achieve higher space utilization than that of
conventional schemes, thereby has potential to save packaging and delivering
cost, as well as enhance operation efficiency.

points to be clustered lie in a metric space, and no candidate centers are
specified. We call such problems "continuous", to distinguish from "discrete"
clustering where candidate centers are specified. For many objectives, one can
reduce the continuous case to the discrete case, and use an
$\alpha$-approximation algorithm for the discrete case to get a
$\beta\alpha$-approximation for the continuous case, where $\beta$ depends on
the objective: e.g. for $k$-median, $\beta = 2$, and for $k$-means, $\beta =
4$. Our motivating question is whether this gap of $\beta$ is inherent, or are
there better algorithms for continuous clustering than simply reducing to the
discrete case? In a recent SODA 2021 paper, Cohen-Addad, Karthik, and Lee prove
a factor-$2$ and a factor-$4$ hardness, respectively, for continuous $k$-median
and $k$-means, even when the number of centers $k$ is a constant. The discrete
case for a constant $k$ is exactly solvable in polytime, so the $\beta$ loss
seems unavoidable in some regimes.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we approach continuous clustering via the round-or-cut
framework. For four continuous clustering problems, we outperform the reduction
to the discrete case. Notably, for the problem $\lambda$-UFL, where $\beta = 2$
and the discrete case has a hardness of $1.27$, we obtain an approximation
ratio of $2.32 &lt; 2 \times 1.27$ for the continuous case. Also, for continuous
$k$-means, where the best known approximation ratio for the discrete case is
$9$, we obtain an approximation ratio of $32 &lt; 4 \times 9$. The key challenge
is that most algorithms for discrete clustering, including the state of the
art, depend on linear programs that become infinite-sized in the continuous
case. To overcome this, we design new linear programs for the continuous case
which are amenable to the round-or-cut framework.

characters are drawn from two different alphabets, where one is considered to
be the alphabet of static characters and the other to be the alphabet of
parameter characters. Two parameterized strings are a parameterized match if
there is a bijection over all characters such that the bijection transforms one
string to the other while keeping the static characters (i.e., it behaves as
the identity on the static alphabet). Ganguly et al.~[SODA'2017] proposed the
parameterized Burrows--Wheeler transform (PBWT) as a variant of the
Burrows--Wheeler transform for space-efficient parameterized pattern matching.
In this paper, we propose an algorithm for computing the PBWT online by reading
the characters of a given input string one-by-one from right to left. Our
algorithm works in $O(|\Pi| \log n / \log \log n)$ amortized time for each
input character, where $n$, $\Sigma$, and $\Pi$ denote the size of the input
string, and the alphabets of the static and parameter characters, respectively.

<p><b>Authors: </b>Adrián Goga, Andrej Baláž <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.15097">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>We propose a new technique for creating a space-efficient index for large
repetitive text collections, such as pangenomic databases containing sequences
of many individuals from the same species. We combine two recent techniques
from this area: Wheeler graphs (Gagie et al., 2017) and prefix-free parsing
(PFP, Boucher et al., 2019). Wheeler graphs (WGs) are a general framework
encompassing several indexes based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT), such
as the FM-index. Wheeler graphs admit a succinct representation which can be
further compacted by employing the idea of tunnelling, which exploits
redundancies in the form of parallel, equally-labelled paths called blocks that
can be merged into a single path. The problem of finding the optimal set of
blocks for tunnelling, i.e. the one that minimizes the size of the resulting
WG, is known to be NP-complete and remains the most computationally challenging
part of the tunnelling process.
</p>
<p>To find an adequate set of blocks in less time, we propose a new method based
on the prefix-free parsing (PFP). The idea of PFP is to divide the input text
into phrases of roughly equal sizes that overlap by a fixed number of
characters. The original text is represented by a sequence of phrase ranks (the
parse) and a list of all used phrases (the dictionary). In repetitive texts,
the PFP of the text is generally much shorter than the original. To speed up
the block selection for tunnelling, we apply the PFP to obtain the parse and
the dictionary of the text, tunnel the WG of the parse using existing
heuristics and subsequently use this tunnelled parse to construct a compact WG
of the original text. Compared with constructing a WG from the original text
without PFP, our method is much faster and uses less memory on collections of
pangenomic sequences. Therefore, our method enables the use of WGs as a
pangenomic reference for real-world datasets.

is, hereditary graph classes in which the treewidth can only be large due to
the presence of a large clique, with the goal of understanding the extent to
which this property has useful algorithmic implications for the Independent Set
and related problems. In the previous paper of the series [Dallard,
Milani\v{c}, and \v{S}torgel, Treewidth versus clique number. II.
Tree-independence number], we introduced the tree-independence number, a
min-max graph invariant related to tree decompositions. Bounded
tree-independence number implies both $(\mathrm{tw},\omega)$-boundedness and
the existence of a polynomial-time algorithm for the Maximum Weight Independent
Set problem, provided that the input graph is given together with a tree
decomposition with bounded independence number.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we consider six graph containment relations and for each of
them characterize the graphs $H$ for which any graph excluding $H$ with respect
to the relation admits a tree decomposition with bounded independence number.
The induced minor relation is of particular interest: we show that excluding
either a $K_5$ minus an edge or the $4$-wheel implies the existence of a tree
decomposition in which every bag is a clique plus at most $3$ vertices, while
excluding a complete bipartite graph $K_{2,q}$ implies the existence of a tree
decomposition with independence number at most $2(q-1)$. Our constructive
proofs are obtained using a variety of tools, including $\ell$-refined tree
decompositions, SPQR trees, and potential maximal cliques. They imply
polynomial-time algorithms for the Independent Set and related problems in an
infinite family of graph classes; in particular, the results apply to the class
of $1$-perfectly orientable graphs, answering a question of Beisegel,
Chudnovsky, Gurvich, Milani\v{c}, and Servatius from 2019.

obtain an analogue of treewidth for edge cuts. Unfortunately, in spite of its
desirable structural properties, it turned out that tree-cut width falls short
as an edge-cut based alternative to treewidth in algorithmic aspects. This has
led to the very recent introduction of a simple edge-based parameter called
edge-cut width [WG 2022], which has precisely the algorithmic applications one
would expect from an analogue of treewidth for edge cuts, but does not have the
desired structural properties. In this paper, we study a variant of tree-cut
width obtained by changing the threshold for so-called thin nodes in tree-cut
decompositions from 2 to 1. We show that this "slim tree-cut width" satisfies
all the requirements of an edge-cut based analogue of treewidth, both
structural and algorithmic, while being less restrictive than edge-cut width.
Our results also include an alternative characterization of slim tree-cut width
via an easy-to-use spanning-tree decomposition akin to the one used for
edge-cut width, a characterization of slim tree-cut width in terms of forbidden
immersions as well as approximation algorithm for computing the parameter.

Terminals (which, given a graph $G$ and a set of $k$ terminals, asks whether
there exist $\binom{k}{2}$ shortest paths, each joining a distinct pair of
terminals such that these paths cover $G$). Moreover, this implies that the

the following query: Query$(s,t,e)$ -- find the length of shortest path from a
fixed source $s$ to any destination vertex $t$ while avoiding any edge $e$. We
design a deterministic algorithm that builds such an oracle in
$\tilde{O}(m\sqrt n)$ time. Our oracle uses $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt n)$ space and can
answer queries in $\tilde{O}(1)$ time. Our oracle is an improvement of the work
of Bil\`{o} et al. (ESA 2021) in the preprocessing time, which constructs the
first deterministic oracle for this problem in $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt n+n^2)$ time.
</p>
<p>Using our distance oracle, we also solve the {\em single source replacement
path problem} (SSR problem). Chechik and Cohen (SODA 2019) designed a
randomized combinatorial algorithm to solve the SSR problem. The running time
of their algorithm is $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt n + n^2)$. In this paper, we show that
the SSR problem can be solved in $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt n + |\mathcal{R}|)$ time,
where $\mathcal{R}$ is the output set of the SSR problem in $G$. Our SSR
algorithm is optimal (upto polylogarithmic factor) as there is a conditional
lower bound of $\Omega(m\sqrt n)$ for any combinatorial algorithm that solves
this problem.

Tóth</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.14911">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>Given a set $S$ of $n$ points in the plane and a parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$, a
Euclidean $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanner is a geometric graph $G=(S,E)$ that
contains a path of weight at most $(1+\varepsilon)\|pq\|_2$ for all $p,q\in S$.
We show that the minimum weight of a Euclidean $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanner for
$n$ points in the unit square $[0,1]^2$ is $O(\varepsilon^{-3/2}\,\sqrt{n})$,
and this bound is the best possible. The upper bound is based on a new spanner
algorithm that sparsifies Yao-graphs. It improves upon the baseline
$O(\varepsilon^{-2}\sqrt{n})$, obtained by combining a tight bound for the
weight of an MST and a tight bound for the lightness of Euclidean
$(1+\varepsilon)$-spanners, which is the ratio of the spanner weight to the
weight of the MST. The result generalizes to $d$-space for all $d\in
\mathbb{N}$: The minimum weight of a Euclidean $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanner for
$n$ points in the unit cube $[0,1]^d$ is
$O_d(\varepsilon^{(1-d^2)/d}n^{(d-1)/d})$, and this bound is the best possible.
</p>
<p>For the $n\times n$ section of the integer lattice, we show that the minimum
weight of a Euclidean $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanner is between
$\Omega(\varepsilon^{-3/4}n^2)$ and $O(\varepsilon^{-1}\log(\varepsilon^{-1})\,
n^2)$. These bounds become $\Omega(\varepsilon^{-3/4}\sqrt{n})$ and
$O(\varepsilon^{-1}\log (\varepsilon^{-1})\sqrt{n})$ when scaled to a grid of
$n$ points in the unit square.

crossing-angles do not impair the readability of a graph drawing, RAC (Right
Angle Crossing) drawings were introduced to address the problem of producing
readable representations of non-planar graphs by supporting the optimal case in
which all crossings form 90{\deg} angles. In this work, we make progress on the
problem of finding RAC drawings of graphs of low degree. In this context, a
long-standing open question asks whether all degree-3 graphs admit
straight-line RAC drawings. This question has been positively answered for the
Hamiltonian degree-3 graphs. We improve on this result by extending to the
class of 3-edge-colorable degree-3 graphs. When each edge is allowed to have
one bend, we prove that degree-4 graphs admit such RAC drawings, a result which
was previously known only for degree-3 graphs. Finally, we show that
7-edge-colorable degree-7 graphs admit RAC drawings with two bends per edge.
This improves over the previous result on degree-6 graphs.

nations on a spherical map and edges are shared curve segments or points
between nations. We present an explicit fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for
recognizing map graphs parameterized by treewidth. The algorithm has time
complexity that is linear in the size of the graph and, if the input is a
yes-instance, it reports a certificate in the form of a so-called witness.
Furthermore, this result is developed within a more general algorithmic
framework that allows to test, for any $k$, if the input graph admits a $k$-map
(where at most $k$ nations meet at a common point) or a hole-free~$k$-map
(where each point of the sphere is covered by at least one nation). We point
out that, although bounding the treewidth of the input graph also bounds the
size of its largest clique, the latter alone does not seem to be a strong
enough structural limitation to obtain an efficient time complexity. In fact,
while the largest clique in a $k$-map graph is $\lfloor 3k/2 \rfloor$, the
recognition of $k$-map graphs is still open for any fixed $k \ge 5$.

Deep learning models often exhibit <strong>consistent</strong> patterns of errors. These errors tend to correspond to hard subpopulations in the data they are deployed on. How can we go about detecting such hard subpopulations, and moreover doing so at scale? Our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14754">recent paper</a> is motivated by this very aim, and presents a framework for automatic distillation and surfacing of a model’s failure modes.

<p>Despite the success of deep learning models at a wide range of classification tasks, they are prone to failing—often by underperforming on “hard” subpopulations corresponding to inputs that were consistently mislabelled, corrupted, or simply underrepresented in the training set. This problem is exacerbated when, as is often the case in practice, deployment conditions deviate from the training distribution. In these cases, the model may have learned (spurious) correlations on the training set that are not predictive on the distribution it is deployed on.</p>

<p>To make this more concrete, consider the task of predicting age (old vs young) based on the CelebA dataset of celebrity face images. It turns out that in this dataset, young women and old men are overrepresented, and thus a model trained on CelebA is likely to leverage the resulting correlation between age and gender in its predictions. Of course, as this correlation does not hold at large, this model would then struggle on inputs representing old women and young men.</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/corr-errs/images/celeba_summary.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="CelebA-Summary" /></p>

<p>How could we go about identifying these types of model errors? Specifically, for this case, how might we identify that it is the spurious age-gender correlation that is driving these failures?</p>

<p>One option is to manually examine either the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11295">dataset</a> or the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04596">model itself</a> to identify specific failure modes. Such approaches, however, can be quite labor-intensive, and thus are difficult to scale. Alternatively, one can try to automatically identify and intervene on hard training examples, such as by directly <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09044">upweighting inputs</a> that were misclassified early in training or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12317">training a second model</a> to adversarially identify misclassified instances. However, these approaches also do not fully hit the mark. Specifically, they are not designed to elicit simple, human-interpretable patterns that underlie hard subpopulations (even when these exist). Thus, while such methods are automatic (and certainly scalable), they do not necessarily translate into the type of understanding needed to remedy the underlying data problem.</p>

<p>The framework developed in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14754">recent work</a> intends to bridge this gap between scalability and interpretability. In particular, it enables us to surface subpopulations of hard examples with respect to a given model in a way that is not only automatic, but also naturally suggests an intervention meant to fix them.</p>

<h2 id="capturing-failure-modes-as-latent-space-directions">Capturing Failure Modes as Latent Space Directions</h2>
<p>At a high level, our approach aims to model failure modes as <em>directions</em> within a latent space. In the context of the CelebA example we described above, this would correspond to identifying a (separate) direction for each class (old/young) such that the easier examples (“old man”/”young women”) lie in one direction, and the harder examples (“old women”/”young man”) lie in the opposite one. As a result, each such direction would end up capturing the axis of the specific failure mode (here, gender) that the model struggles with.</p>

<p>But how can we learn such a direction to begin with? The key intuition is that, whenever the pattern of errors we aim to capture corresponds to a global failure mode, such as a spurious correlation, the model will make these errors <em>consistently</em>. In other words, the incorrectly classified inputs will share features. As a result, we can capture the pattern behind these mistakes by training a classifier on the feature embedding, which <em>predicts</em> when the model is likely to make an error on a given input.</p>

<p>More specifically, in our framework we train for each class (using a held-out validation set) a linear support vector machine (SVM) that predicts the errors of the original model. The decision boundary of this SVM then establishes a <em>hyperplane</em> separating the correct from the incorrect examples. Moreover, the vector orthogonal to this decision boundary (the normal vector of the hyperplane) represents the direction of the captured failure mode that we are seeking. Indeed, the more aligned an example is with the identified direction, the harder (or easier) the example was for the original model—this is exactly what we needed!</p>

<p>Of course, to make sure this trained SVM can indeed capture the features shared by the errors, we need a suitable featurization for the inputs. In our (image) context, we use <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00020.pdf">CLIP</a>, which embeds both vision and language together using contrastive learning. (As we will see below, using this embedding space has the added benefit of enabling us to automatically caption the captured failure modes, too!)</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/corr-errs/images/updated_summary_fig.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="Summary" /></p>
<div class="footnote">
Given our original model, for each class (here, ``old"), we train a SVM on a shared vision/language latent space to predict whether the original model would have classified an input correctly. We then extract a direction (in gray) for the captured failure mode, as the vector orthogonal to the corresponding learned hyperplane. Since the original model struggles on ``old female" faces, the SVM learns to use gender to separate the incorrect (shown in red) vs. correct (shown in green) examples.
</div>

<p><strong>Identifying the gender spurious correlation in CelebA</strong>: Let’s return to our example of identifying age for CelebA faces in the presence of a spurious correlation with gender, and apply our framework as described above. The plot below depicts the fraction of test images within each class that are of the minority gender when ordering the images by either their SVM decision value, or by our baseline of using the model’s confidences. We can see that the SVM directions indeed capture the gender-age spurious association, as intended.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<h3 id="interpreting-the-extracted-failure-mode">Interpreting the extracted failure mode</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve distilled the model’s failure modes as directions within the latent space, how can we understand what these failure modes entail exactly?</p>

<p><strong>Most Aligned Examples.</strong> One approach is to simply surface the examples whose normalized embeddings are most aligned (or anti-aligned) with the extracted direction. These are the images with the most positive or negative SVM <em>decision value</em> (which is proportional to the signed distance from the decision boundary). In doing so, we surface the prototypical examples representing the “most correct” and “most incorrect” examples.</p>

<p><strong>Automatic Captioning.</strong> We can, however, go one step further by automatically captioning the extracted failure mode, leveraging the fact that the SVM was trained on a shared vision/language embedding space. Recall that CLIP embeds both images <em>and</em> language into the same latent space. Thus, just as we surfaced the most aligned <em>images</em> above, we can surface the most aligned <em>captions</em> (from some pre-specified set of captions) whose normalized text embedding matches the extracted direction. More details can be found in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14754">paper</a>.</p>

<p>Both techniques are shown below on our running CelebA example. As we can see, images farthest from the SVM decision boundary indeed exemplify the hardest (“old woman”) or the easiest (“old man”) examples. The captions also reflect the corresponding categories.</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/corr-errs/figures/celeba_most_extreme_examples.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="CelebA-Examples" /></p>

<h2 id="man-with-a-fish-discovering-failure-modes-in-the-imagenet-dataset">Man with a Fish: Discovering Failure Modes in the ImageNet Dataset</h2>
<p>In the CelebA example we were considering so far, the dataset contained a <em>known</em>, planted spurious correlation (i.e., gender). How will our framework fare when this is not necessarily the case? To study this, let’s apply our framework to the ImageNet dataset (and see our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14754">paper</a> for more examples).</p>

<p>What does our framework flag? A broad range of interpretable failure modes—from color biases (e.g., the model struggles on red wolves with white winter coats) to reliance on co-occurring objects (e.g., the model more easily classifies the tench fish in the presence of a person).</p>

<div style="overflow: auto; text-align: center;" id="bias_examples_widget"></div>
<div class="footnote">
     Images and captions with the most positive or negative SVM decision values for a given ImageNet class. (Click the thumbnails on the left to explore)
</div>

<p>Are the flagged subpopulations actually challenging for the original model? To check this, we would ideally compare the difference in test accuracy between the “easy” and “hard” subpopulations proposed by our framework. For example, in the above example of the tench fish, we would hope that tenches described by the “easy” caption (“a photo of an orange fish with a person”) have a higher accuracy on held-out examples than those described by the “hard” caption (“a photo of a close-up fish”).</p>

<p>However, we do not have annotations for the sub-groups of ImageNet necessary to execute this measurement directly. Still, as a proxy, we can use the CLIP shared vision/language embedding space to <em>approximate</em> these sub-group accuracies. So, for example, to evaluate the model’s performance on people with orange fish, we simply check its accuracy on the images whose CLIP embeddings are closest (in cosine distance) to the embedded SVM caption “a photo of an orange fish with a person”.</p>

<p>Performing this kind of evaluation for all the 1000 of ImageNet classes, we find that the original model’s accuracy on the images closest to the “hard caption” is consistently (and significantly) lower than those closest to the “easy caption.” In other words, our framework successfully surfaces the patterns of failure modes. Furthermore, as we describe in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14754">paper</a>, these surfaced patterns guide effective interventions too.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this post, we introduced a framework for automatically identifying and captioning coherent subpopulations that are especially hard, or easy, for a given model to classify. In particular, our framework harnesses (linear) classifiers to distill the model’s failure modes as meaningful directions in the latent space. Our framework was able to surface challenging subpopulations in widely used datasets such as ImageNet: check out our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14754">paper</a> for even more examples (and datasets)!</p>

<p>Overall, we view our methodology as a first step toward building a toolkit for scalable dataset exploration and debiasing—we believe, however, that there is much more to do. For example, we consider only relatively straightforward data interventions (such as upweighting and filtering). Can we come up with more sophisticated interventions to improve the model’s performance on the identified subpopulations? In particular, given all the recent enormous progress on text-to-image generation, one especially  promising approach to explore here could be to generate new data that is tailored to the model’s weaknesses (for example, by using <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/papers/dall-e-2.pdf">DALL-E 2</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.11487.pdf">ImageGen</a>).</p></div>

<p>You may have played with a paper yoyo, a strip of paper wrapped around a stick so that when you flick it with your wrist, it extends outward into a long tube. Here’s one, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Arcade_Paper_Laser,_August_8th_2016.jpeg">the only example I could find on Wikimedia Commons</a>:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/paper-yoyo.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Arcade Paper Laser, public domain image by Zhonghua88, 8 August 2016, from Wikimedia Commons" /></p>

<p>If you’ve used one, then the way they work is simple and intuitive. But if you know a little bit about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_of_paper_folding">mathematics of paper folding</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developable_surface">developable surfaces</a>, and think about it, it starts to seem a little strange.</p>

<p>Paper can bend or fold, but not stretch. When a flat sheet of paper is bent into a smooth but not flat surface (as it is in all states of the paper yoyo), it bends along straight “bend lines” that extend all the way across the surface, and that are forced to remain straight. You may be familiar with the way that a slice of pizza will droop if you try to hold it flat from its crust, but will remain straight if you bend it lengthwise: the bend lines are holding it in a rigid shape. Or, if you roll a poster into a cylinder, you can wave it around like a light saber, again making it much more rigid than the unrolled poster (at least until you hit it into something hard enough to crumple it).</p>

<p>In the rolled-up state of the paper yoyo, it’s again rolled into a cylinder, with bend lines parallel to the cylinder axis. If we mark some of those bend lines and unroll it flat, it might look something like this:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/paper-yoyo-rolled.svg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Bend lines in a rolled paper yoyo" /></p>

<p>But then, what happens when you extend it? The paper cannot stretch from its rectangular shape into a parallelogram. Instead, as it extends, the bend lines continuously rotate on the surface of the paper. Near the point where they attach to the stick, the non-perpendicular bend lines cause the paper to flare out a little from its cylindrical shape, but it is surrounded by more wrapped paper constraining it from flaring very widely, so the bend lines must still stay near their original orientations. Farther along the yoyo, the bend lines can twist to bigger angles:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/paper-yoyo-extended.svg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Bend lines in a rolled paper yoyo" /></p>

<p>So although the bend lines of a smoothly bent sheet of paper are rigid along their length, they can slide and twist continuously within the sheet, as the sheet flexes continuously while remaining smooth. This twisting motion of bend lines is essential for understanding the seemingly-knotted surface below, two round disks connected by a thin band tied in an overhand knot:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/knotted-dumbbell.svg" alt="Knotted paper dumbbell shape" /></p>

<p>If you want to unknot it while keeping it smooth rather than crumpling it, you will obviously have to make the disks smaller by rolling them up somehow, perhaps into a cylinder around one of their diameters. But if you do that, you will put a bend line through or near the diameter, which will act like a rigid rod. And if you attach the knotted center band to two rigid rods, of length equal to the diameter of the disks, you definitely cannot untie it. The rods are too long to poke all the way through the knot before getting stuck.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this surface can be untied while keeping it smooth! The trick is that, after you have rolled up one of the disks to make a rigid cylinder, with the tied band at one end, you can twist the roll, so that its bend lines rotate around the disk. As you do, the point where the band is tied will slide from one end of the cylinder to the other. And you can make this sliding motion coincide with the motion of the cylinder through a hole in the tied band, untying it.</p>

<p>This and similar examples are the focus of my third new CCCG preprint, “Locked and unlocked smooth embeddings of surfaces”, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12989">arXiv:2206.12989</a>. In the phrasing of the title, the two disks with a tied center band, above, are unlocked: they can be reconfigured to a flat state while remaining smooth. My paper also shows that any compact shape with a continuous shrinking motion into itself, like the polygon below, is unlocked.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/generalized-star.svg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Polygon with a continuous shrinking motion" /></p>

<p>On the other hand, there exist surfaces that, while topologically equivalent to their flat state, cannot be made flat through a continuous sequence of smooth embeddings. The simplest one that I found consists of a central square mat, rolled up into a cylinder and held into its cylindrical shape by two loops, entangled with each other in a pattern based on the Borromean rings:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/tied-roll.svg" alt="Locked shape consisting of a rolled square mat with two entangled loops" /></p>

<p>There is actually quite a lot of freedom in the pattern of bend lines of the central square. They can twist until the bend line through the center of the square gets halfway to the corners of the square:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/bent-roll.svg" alt="Twisted bend lines in the rolled square mat" /></p>

<p>But after that point, the entangled loops block the twisting from going any farther. They cannot be disentangled from each other without being pulled around the rigid central bend line, and they are too short for that to be possible, so the surface is locked.</p>

<p>It’s not clear to me whether all simple polygons are unlocked, or whether it’s possible to make locked polygons without holes. I also don’t have any algorithmic results in this area; it seems likely that testing whether a surface is locked or unlocked is hard, but I don’t know how to prove it.</p>

<p>I was privileged to be part of various email exchanges about those same questions with Steven Pinker, Ernest Davis, Gary Marcus, Douglas Hofstadter, and Scott Alexander.  It’s fair to say that, overall, Pinker, Davis, Marcus, and Hofstadter were more impressed by GPT-3’s blunders, while we Scotts were more impressed by its abilities.  (On the other hand, Hofstadter, more so than Pinker, Davis, or Marcus, said that he’s terrified about how powerful GPT-like systems will become in the future.)</p>



<p>Anyway, at some point Pinker produced an essay setting out his thoughts, and asked whether “either of the Scotts” wanted to share it on our blogs.  Knowing an intellectual scoop when I see one, I answered that I’d be honored to host Steve’s essay—along with my response, along with Steve’s response to <em>that</em>.  To my delight, Steve immediately agreed.  Enjoy!  –SA</p>

<h2><strong>Steven Pinker’s Initial Salvo</strong></h2>



<p>Will future deep learning models with more parameters and trained on more examples avoid the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/22/1007539/gpt3-openai-language-generator-artificial-intelligence-ai-opinion/">silly blunders</a> which Gary Marcus and Ernie Davis entrap GPT into making, and render their criticisms obsolete?  And if they keep exposing new blunders in new models, would this just be <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/my-bet-ai-size-solves-flubs?s=r">moving the goalposts</a>?  Either way, what’s at stake?</p>



<p>It depends very much on the question.  There’s the cognitive science question of whether humans think and speak the way GPT-3 and other deep-learning neural network models do.  And there’s the engineering question of whether the way to develop better, humanlike AI is to upscale deep learning models (as opposed to incorporating different mechanisms, like a knowledge database and propositional reasoning).</p>



<p>The questions are, to be sure, related: If a model is incapable of duplicating a human feat like language understanding, it can’t be a good theory of how the human mind works.  Conversely, if a model flubs some task that humans can ace, perhaps it’s because it’s missing some mechanism that powers the human mind.  Still, they’re not the same question: As with airplanes and other machines, an artificial system can duplicate or exceed a natural one but work in a different way.</p>



<p>Apropos the scientific question, I don’t see the Marcus-Davis challenges as benchmarks or long bets that they have to rest their case on.  I see them as scientific probing of an empirical hypothesis, namely whether the human language capacity works like GPT-3.  Its failures of common sense are one form of evidence that the answer is “no,” but there are others—for example, that it needs to be trained on half a trillion words, or about 10,000 years of continuous speech, whereas human children get pretty good after 3 years.  Conversely, it needs no social and perceptual context to make sense of its training set, whereas children do (hearing children of deaf parents don’t learn spoken language from radio and TV).  Another diagnostic is that baby-talk is very different from the output of a partially trained GPT.  Also, humans can generalize their language skill to express their intentions across a wide range of social and environmental contexts, whereas GPT-3 is fundamentally a text extrapolator (a task, incidentally, which humans aren’t particularly good at).  There are surely other empirical probes, limited only by scientific imagination, and it doesn’t make sense in science to set up a single benchmark for an empirical question once and for all.  As we learn more about a phenomenon, and as new theories compete to explain it, we need to develop more sensitive instruments and more clever empirical tests.  That’s what I see Marcus and Davis as doing.</p>



<p>Regarding the second, engineering question of whether scaling up deep-learning models will “get us to Artificial General Intelligence”: I think the question is probably ill-conceived, because I think the concept of “general intelligence” is meaningless.  (I’m not referring to the psychometric variable <em>g</em>, also called “general intelligence,” namely the principal component of correlated variation across IQ subtests.  This is  a variable that aggregates many contributors to the brain’s efficiency such as cortical thickness and neural transmission speed, but it is not a mechanism (just as “horsepower” is a meaningful variable, but it doesn’t explain how cars move.)  I find most characterizations of AGI to be either circular (such as “smarter than humans in every way,” begging the question of what “smarter” means) or mystical—a kind of omniscient, omnipotent, and clairvoyant power to solve any problem.  No logician has ever outlined a normative model of what general intelligence would consist of, and even Turing swapped it out for the problem of fooling an observer, which spawned 70 years of unhelpful reminders of how easy it is to fool an observer.</p>



<p>If we do try to define “intelligence” in terms of mechanism rather than magic, it seems to me it would be something like “the ability to use information to attain a goal in an environment.”  (“Use information” is shorthand for performing computations that embody laws that govern the world, namely logic, cause and effect, and statistical regularities.  “Attain a goal” is shorthand for optimizing the attainment of <em>multiple</em> goals, since different goals trade off.)  Specifying the goal is critical to any definition of intelligence: a given strategy in basketball will be intelligent if you’re trying to win a game and stupid if you’re trying to throw it.  So is the environment: a given strategy can be smart under NBA rules and stupid under college rules.</p>



<p>Since a goal itself is neither intelligent or unintelligent (Hume and all that), but must be exogenously built into a system, and since no physical system has clairvoyance for all the laws of the world it inhabits down to the last butterfly wing-flap, this implies that there are as many intelligences as there are goals and environments.  There will be no omnipotent superintelligence or wonder algorithm (or singularity or AGI or existential threat or foom), just better and better gadgets.</p>



<p>In the case of humans, natural selection has built in multiple goals—comfort, pleasure, reputation, curiosity, power, status, the well-being of loved ones—which may trade off, and are sometimes randomized or inverted in game-theoretic paradoxical tactics.  Not only does all this make psychology hard, but it makes human intelligence a dubious benchmark for artificial systems.  Why would anyone <em>want </em>to emulate human intelligence in an artificial system (any more than a mechanical engineer would want to duplicate a human body, with all its fragility)?  Why not build the best possible autonomous vehicle, or language translator, or dishwasher-emptier, or baby-sitter, or protein-folding predictor?  And who cares whether the best autonomous vehicle driver would be, out of the box, a good baby-sitter?  Only someone who thinks that intelligence is some all-powerful elixir.</p>



<p>Back to GPT-3, DALL-E, LaMDA, and other deep learning models: It seems to me that the question of whether or not they’re taking us closer to “Artificial General Intelligence” (or, heaven help us, “sentience”) is based not on any analysis of what AGI would consist of but on our being gobsmacked by what they can do.  But refuting our intuitions about what a massively trained, massively parameterized network is capable of (and I’ll admit that they refuted mine) should not be confused with a path toward omniscience and omnipotence.  GPT-3 is unquestionably awesome at its designed-in goal of extrapolating text.  But that is not the main goal of human language competence, namely expressing and perceiving intentions.  Indeed, the program is not even set up to input or output intentions, since that would require deep thought about how to represent intentions, which went out of style in AI as the big-data/deep-learning hammer turned every problem into a nail.  That’s why no one is using GPT-3 to answer their email or write an article or legal brief (except to show how well the program can spoof one).</p>



<p>So is Scott Alexander right that every scaled-up GPT-<em>n</em> will avoid the blunders that Marcus and Davis show in GPT-(<em>n</em>-1)?  Perhaps, though I doubt it, for reasons that Marcus and Davis explain well (in particular, that astronomical training sets at best compensate for their being crippled by the lack of a world model).  But even if they do, that would show neither that human language competence is a GPT (given the totality of the relevant evidence) nor that GPT-<em>n</em> is approaching Artificial General Intelligence (whatever that is).</p>

<h2><strong>Scott Aaronson’s Response</strong></h2>



<p>As usual, I find Steve crystal-clear and precise—so much so that we can quickly dispense with the many points of agreement.  Basically, one side says that, while GPT-3 is of course mind-bogglingly impressive, and while it refuted confident predictions that no such thing would work, in the end it’s just a text-prediction engine that will run with any absurd premise it’s given, and it fails to model the world the way humans do.  The other side says that, while GPT-3 is of course just a text-prediction engine that will run with any absurd premise it’s given, and while it fails to model the world the way humans do, in the end it’s mind-bogglingly impressive, and it refuted confident predictions that no such thing would work.</p>



<p>All the same, I do think it’s possible to identify a substantive disagreement between the distinguished baby-boom linguistic thinkers and the gen-X/gen-Y blogging Scott A.’s: namely, whether there’s a coherent concept of “general intelligence.”  Steve writes:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>No logician has ever outlined a normative model of what general intelligence would consist of, and even Turing swapped it out for the problem of fooling an observer, which spawned 70 years of unhelpful reminders of how easy it is to fool an observer.</p></blockquote>



<p>I freely admit that I have no principled definition of “general intelligence,” let alone of “superintelligence.”  To my mind, though, there’s a simple proof-of-principle that there’s <em>something</em> an AI could do that pretty much any of us would call “superintelligent.”  Namely, it could say whatever Albert Einstein would say in a given situation, while thinking a thousand times faster.  Feed the AI all the information about physics that the historical Einstein had in 1904, for example, and it would discover special relativity in a few hours, followed by general relativity a few days later.  Give the AI a year, and it would think … well, whatever thoughts Einstein would’ve thought, if he’d had a millennium in peak mental condition to think them.</p>



<p>If nothing else, this AI could work by simulating Einstein’s brain neuron-by-neuron—provided we believe in the computational theory of mind, as I’m assuming we do.  It’s true that we don’t <em>know</em> the detailed structure of Einstein’s brain in order to simulate it (we might have, had the pathologist who <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/1997/10/driving-mr-albert/">took it</a> from the hospital used cold rather than warm formaldehyde).  But that’s irrelevant to the argument.  It’s also true that the AI won’t experience the same environment that Einstein would have—so, alright, imagine putting it in a very comfortable simulated study, and letting it interact with the world’s flesh-based physicists.  A-Einstein can even propose experiments for the human physicists to do—he’ll just have to wait an <em>excruciatingly</em> long subjective time for their answers.  But that’s OK: as an AI, he never gets old.</p>



<p>Next let’s throw into the mix AI Von Neumann, AI Ramanujan, AI Jane Austen, even AI Steven Pinker—all, of course, sped up 1,000x compared to their meat versions, even able to interact with thousands of sped-up copies of themselves and other scientists and artists.  Do we agree that these entities quickly become the predominant intellectual force on earth—to the point where there’s little for the original humans left to do but understand and implement the AIs’ outputs (and, of course, eat, drink, and enjoy their lives, assuming the AIs can’t or don’t want to prevent that)?  If so, then that seems to suffice to call the AIs “superintelligences.”  Yes, <em>of course</em> they’re still limited in their ability to manipulate the physical world.  Yes, <em>of course</em> they still don’t optimize arbitrary goals.  All the same, these AIs have effects on the real world consistent with the sudden appearance of beings able to run intellectual rings around humans—not <em>exactly</em> as we do around chimpanzees, but not exactly unlike it either.</p>



<p>I should clarify that, in practice, I don’t expect AGI to work by slavishly emulating humans—and not only because of the practical difficulties of scanning brains, especially deceased ones.  Like with airplanes, like with existing deep learning, I expect future AIs to take some inspiration from the natural world but also to depart from it whenever convenient.  The point is that, since there’s <em>something</em> that would plainly count as “superintelligence,” the question of whether it can be achieved is therefore “merely” an engineering question, not a philosophical one.</p>



<p>Obviously I don’t know the answer to the engineering question: no one does!  One could consistently hold that, while the thing I described would clearly count as “superintelligence,” it’s just an amusing fantasy, unlikely to be achieved for millennia if ever.  One could hold that all the progress in AI so far, including the scaling of language models, has taken us only 0% or perhaps 0.00001% of the way toward superintelligence so defined.</p>



<p>So let me make two comments about the engineering question.  The first is that there’s good news here, at least epistemically: unlike with the philosophical questions, we’re virtually guaranteed more clarity over time!  Indeed, we’ll know vastly more just by the end of this decade, as the large language models are further scaled and tweaked, and we find out whether they develop effective representations of the outside world and of themselves, the ability to reject absurd premises and avoid self-contradiction, or even the ability to generate original mathematical proofs and scientific hypotheses.  Of course, Gary Marcus and Scott Alexander have already placed concrete bets on the table for what sorts of things will be possible by 2030.  For all their differences in rhetoric, I was struck that their <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/somewhat-contra-marcus-on-ai-scaling">actual</a> <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/does-ai-really-need-a-paradigm-shift?s=w#footnote-anchor-1">probabilities</a> differed much more modestly.</p>



<p>So then what explains the glaring differences in rhetoric?  This brings me to my second comment: whenever there’s a new, rapidly-growing, poorly-understood phenomenon, whether it’s the Internet or AI or COVID, there are two wildly different modes of responding to it, which we might call “February 2020 mode” and “March 2020 mode.”  In February 2020 mode, one says: yes, a naïve extrapolation might lead someone to the conclusion that this new thing is going to expand exponentially and conquer the world, dramatically changing almost every other domain—but precisely <em>because</em> that conclusion seems absurd on its face, it’s our responsibility as serious intellectuals to articulate what’s wrong with the arguments that lead to it.  In March 2020 mode, one says: holy crap, the naïve extrapolation seems right!  Prepare!!  Why didn’t we start earlier?</p>



<p>Often, to be sure, February 2020 mode is the better mode, at least for outsiders—as with the Y2K bug, or the many disease outbreaks that fizzle.  My point here is simply that February 2020 mode and March 2020 mode differ by only a month.  Sometimes hearing a single argument, seeing a single example, is enough to trigger an epistemic cascade, causing all the same facts to be seen in a new light.  As a result, reasonable people might find themselves on opposite sides of the chasm even if they started just a few steps from each other.</p>



<p>As for me?  Well, I’m currently trying to hold the line around February 26, 2020.  Suspending my day job in the humdrum, pedestrian field of quantum computing, I’ve decided to spend a year at OpenAI, thinking about the theoretical foundations of AI safety.  But for now, only a year.</p>

<h2><strong>Steven Pinker’s Response to Scott</strong></h2>



<p>Thanks, Scott, for your thoughtful and good-natured reply, and for offering me the opportunity to respond  in <em>Shtetl-Optimized, </em>one of my favorite blogs. Despite the areas of agreement, I still think that discussions of AI and its role in human affairs—including AI safety—will be muddled as long as the writers treat intelligence as an undefined superpower rather than a mechanisms with a makeup that determines what it can and can’t do. We won’t get clarity on AI if we treat the “I” as “whatever fools us,” or “whatever amazes us,” or “whatever IQ tests measure,” or “whatever we have more of than animals do,” or “whatever Einstein has more of than we do”—and then start to worry about a superintelligence that has much, much more of whatever that is.</p>



<p>Take Einstein sped up a thousandfold. To begin with, current AI is not even taking us in that direction. As you note, no one is reverse-engineering his connectome, and current AI does not think the way Einstein thought, namely by visualizing physical scenarios and manipulating mathematical equations. Its current pathway would be to train a neural network with billions of physics problems and their solutions and hope that it would soak up the statistical patterns.</p>



<p>Of course, the reason you pointed to a sped-up Einstein was to procrastinate having to define “superintelligence.” But if intelligence is a collection of mechanisms rather than a quantity that Einstein was blessed with a lot of, it’s not clear that just speeding him up would capture what anyone would call superintelligence. After all, in many areas Einstein was no Einstein. You above all could speak of his not-so-superintelligence in quantum physics, and when it came world affairs, in the early 1950s he offered the not exactly prescient or practicable prescription, “Only the creation of a world government can prevent the impending self-destruction of mankind.” So it’s not clear that we <em>would </em>call a system that could dispense such pronouncements in seconds rather than years “superintelligent.” Nor with speeding up other geniuses, say, an AI Bertrand Russell, who would need just nanoseconds to offer his own solution for world peace: the Soviet Union would be given an ultimatum that unless it immediately submitted to world government, the US (which at the time had a nuclear monopoly) would bomb it with nuclear weapons.</p>



<p>My point isn’t to poke retrospective fun at brilliant men, but to reiterate that brilliance itself is not some uncanny across-the-board power that can be “scaled” by speeding it up or otherwise; it’s an engineered system that does particular things in particular ways. Only with a <em>criterion </em>for intelligence can we say which of these counts as intelligent.</p>



<p>Now, it’s true that raw speed makes new kinds of computation possible, and I feel silly writing this to you of all people, but speeding a process up by a constant factor is of limited use with problems that are exponential, as the space of possible scientific theories, relative to their complexity, must be. Speeding up a search in the space of theories a thousandfold would be a rounding error in the time it took to find a correct one. Scientific progress depends on the search exploring the infinitesimal fraction of the space in which the true theories are likely to lie, and this depends on the quality of the intelligence, not just its raw speed.</p>



<p>And it depends as well on a phenomenon you note, namely that scientific progress depends on empirical discovery, not deduction from a silicon armchair. The particle accelerators and space probes and wet labs and clinical trials still have to be implemented, with data accumulating at a rate set by the world. Strokes of genius can surely speed up the rate of discovery, but in the absence of omniscience about every particle, the time scale will still be capped by empirical reality. And this in turn directs the search for viable theories: which part of the space one should explore is guided by the current state of scientific knowledge, which depends on the tempo of discovery. Speeding up scientists a thousandfold would not speed up science a thousandfold.</p>



<p>All this is relevant to AI safety. I’m all for safety, but I worry that the dazzling intellectual capital being invested in the topic will not make us any safer if it begins with a woolly conception of intelligence as a kind of wonder stuff that you can have in different amounts. It leads to unhelpful analogies, like “exponential increase in the number of infectious people during a pandemic” ≈ “exponential increase in intelligence in AI systems.” It encourages other questionable extrapolations from the human case, such as imagining that an intelligent tool will develop an alpha-male lust for domination. Worst of all, it may encourage misconceptions of AI risk itself, particularly the standard scenario in which a hypothetical future AGI is given some preposterously generic single goal such as “cure cancer” or “make people happy” and theorists fret about the hilarious collateral damage that would ensue.</p>



<p>If intelligence is a mechanism rather than a superpower, the real dangers of AI come into sharper focus. An AI system designed to replace workers may cause mass unemployment; a system designed to use data to sort people may sort them in ways we find invidious; a system designed to fool people may be exploited to fool them in nefarious ways; and as many other hazards as there are AI systems. These dangers are not conjectural, and I suspect each will have to be mitigated by a different combination of policies and patches, just like other safety challenges such as falls, fires, and drownings. I’m curious whether, once intelligence is precisely characterized, any abstract theoretical foundations of AI safety will be useful in dealing with the actual AI dangers that will confront us.</p></div>

<p><em>[Yet another <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/category/philosophizing/">“philosophizing”</a> post, but one with some actual numbers. –Boaz]</em></p>



<p>Recently there have been many debates on “artificial general intelligence” (AGI) and whether or not we are close to achieving it by scaling up our current AI systems. In this post, I’d like to make this debate a bit more quantitative by trying to understand what “scaling” would entail. The calculations are very rough – think of a post-it that is stuck on the back of an envelope. But I hope that this can be at least a starting point for making these questions more concrete.</p>



<p>The first problem is that there is no agreement on what “artificial general intelligence” means.  People use this term to mean anything between the following possibilities: </p>



<ol><li>Existence of a system that can meet benchmarks such as getting a perfect score on the SAT and IQ tests and passing a “Turing test.”  This is more or less the definition used by <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/4815/date-of-first-agi-according-to-forecasters/">Metaculus</a> (though they recently updated it to a <a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/5121/date-of-general-ai/">stricter version</a>).</li><li>Existence of a system that can replace many humans in terms of economic productivity. For concreteness, say that it can function as an above-average worker in many industries. (To sidestep the issue of robotics, we can restrict our attention to remote-only jobs.)</li><li>Large-scale deployment of AI, replacing or radically changing the nature of work of a large fraction of people. </li><li>More extreme scenarios such as consciousness, malice, and super-intelligence. For example, a system that is conscious/sentient enough to be awarded human rights and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jun/12/google-engineer-ai-bot-sentient-blake-lemoine">its own attorney</a>, or malicious enough to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uMQ3cqWDPHhjtiesc/agi-ruin-a-list-of-lethalities">order DNA off the Internet, build a nanofactory to construct a diamondoid bacteria riding on miniature rockets, so they enter the bloodstream of all humans and kills everyone instantly, while not being detected</a>.</li></ol>



<p>I consider the first scenario– passing IQ tests or even a Turing test– more of a “parlor trick” than actual intelligence.  The history of artificial intelligence is one of <em>underestimating</em> future achievements on specific benchmarks, but also one of <em>overestimating</em> the broader implications of those benchmarks. Early AI researchers were not only wrong about how long it will take for a computer program to become the world chess champion, but they also wrongly assumed that such a program would have to be generally intelligent as well. In a 1970 interview, Minsky was <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065245808604088">quoted</a> as saying that by the end of the 1970s, <em>“we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being … able to read Shakespeare, grease a car, play office politics, tell a joke, have a fight. At that point, the machine will begin to educate itself with fantastic speed. In a few months, it will be at genius level, and a few months after, its powers will be incalculable…  In the interests of efficiency, cost-cutting, and speed of reaction, the Department of Defense may well be forced more and more to surrender human direction of military policies to machines.”</em> </p>



<p>Brooks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox">explains</a> that early AI researchers thought intelligence was “best characterized as the things that highly educated male scientists found challenging.” Since playing championship-level chess was hard for them, they couldn’t imagine a machine doing it without doing all other tasks that they considered more trivial. Getting a high SAT or IQ exam score is no more meaningful (for machines or humans) than doing well in chess. </p>



<p>The fourth scenario is, at the moment, too speculative for quantitative discussion and hence less appropriate for this post  (though see the addendum below).  We will focus on the second and third scenarios, which are necessary stepping stones for the more extreme fourth option. For the sake of concreteness, I will make the optimistic assumption that “scale is all you need” to achieve either of these scenarios. I will then try to see our best estimates on <strong>how much scale</strong> and <strong>at what cost</strong>.</p>



<p>The point of this post is not to argue that we will never achieve scenarios 2 or 3. Instead, it is to try to get quantitative estimates on challenges we would need to overcome to do so. I believe it is possible, but it would be more than just getting better hardware. </p>



<p>This is a long post. If I had to <strong>TL;DR</strong> it, I would say that we have significant uncertainty on how much scale we need for AGI. Scaling to 10-100 Trillion parameters may well get us to Scenario 2 or something near. Still, training and (potentially) inference costs may be prohibitive to achieving the reliability and generality needed for actual deployment. Some challenges we face include:</p>



<p><strong>(1)</strong> Maintaining long-term context without model size exploding.  </p>



<p><strong>(2)</strong> Making training more efficient, particularly finding ways to train N-sized models at a near-linear cost instead of quadratic in N.</p>



<p><strong>(3)</strong> Avoid running out of data, perhaps by using video/images and programmatically generated interactive simulations.</p>



<p><strong>(4)</strong> Handling multi-step interactions without the interaction going “off the rails” and without needing to scale policy/value gradients to an unfeasible number of interactions (perhaps by using smaller RL-trained “verifier models” to choose between options produced by a large statically-trained model). </p>



<p>This post is focused on quantitative issues rather than questions such as “consciousness” or the risks of AI. Those deserve a post of their own. See the addendum at the end for some more philosophical/speculative discussion.</p>

Some of these, including health care aides, nurses, and teachers, are unlikely to be replaced by AI soon. The quality of current AI is also not the bottleneck in replacing retail salespersons, cashiers, and fast-food and counter workers.   Similarly, jobs such as laborers and material movers, which involve physical work in constantly changing environments, are unlikely to be cost-effective to automatize in the near future. </figure>

<h3><strong>Initial notes</strong></h3>



<p>Since artificial intelligence exists in the virtual space, people often assume that we can clone it an arbitrary number of times. But modern AI systems have a highly non-trivial physical footprint. Current models require dozens of GPUs to store their parameters, and future ones would be even larger. Creating many copies of such systems is going to be challenging.</p>



<p>Another common assumption is that by Moore’s law, if we manage to build a system at the level of (say) a sixth-grader, then in a year, we would have a virtual Einstein. However, often performance on a metric scale with the <strong>logarithm</strong> of the number of parameters (e.g., see Big-bench and Parti figures). So, perhaps a better assumption is that if we manage to build a virtual sixth-grader, then the following year, we would have a virtual seventh-grader.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FAFhzz-aKnE_J6tYSgrt5PJSapIMUWZDWwdI-gqb1SwdKFE8TGQhcmNHWTXSt-SY4eKBDHbu-weP25MtVb8_FBu_cSCk1WAIoCkhsS_cQWMuLSxddSwgPN_it_4m1KP9SzH7IszegCZSVslxbg" alt="" /><strong>Figure:</strong> Performance of models on the BIG-bench tasks (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04615">Srivastava et al., 22</a>). Note that performance scales with the <strong>logarithm</strong> of the number of parameters. This is in contrast to power-law dependence on the number of parameters which is typically manifested for metrics that are close to saturation. For the JSON tasks, naive extrapolation from 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>11 </sup>suggests an improvement of about 4 points per order of magnitude. However, the rapid growth exhibited by PaLM models suggests potentially better improvements. Jascha Sohl-Dikstein’s rough estimate is that 1-10 Trillion parameters would suffice for achieving expert performance in 80% of the tasks.</figure>

<h2><strong>If scale is all you need, how much scale will we need?</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s assume that we could reach the second scenario (proof of concept general AI system) by simply scaling up our current auto-regressive language models by a factor of X. What would be X?</p>



<p><strong>Adaptivity. </strong>One crucial difference between the tasks we currently test language models on and general intelligence is <em>adaptivity</em>. A model that answers a question correctly with 95% probability is excellent. But with a 5% chance of error, such a model may go “off the rails” in a back-and-forth conversation with more than 20 steps. Adaptivity is one reason why robotics performance (even in <a href="https://svl.stanford.edu/igibson/">simulated virtual worlds</a>) still lags far behind humans. It is not so much that the physical environment is higher dimensional than the inputs to language models, but the fact that robots’ actions impact it (and unlike in the case of Chess, Go, or Atari, we don’t have an unlimited number of restarts and simulations). Navigating the social and technical environment of (even a virtual) workplace is no less challenging. Squeezing out that final performance (e.g., from 95% to 99%) is usually when power laws kick in, reducing error by a factor of k, requiring a multiplicative overhead of k to some power a&gt;1.</p>



<p><strong>Context length.</strong> Another way to think of scaling is the length of the context window models keep.  To be useful in replacing a human worker, we don’t want to continuously simulate their first day at work. We want an employee that remembers what they did yesterday, last week, and last year. GPT-3 maintains a window of 2048 tokens, corresponding to roughly 1500 words or three pages of text. However, if you had to write a letter to your future self detailing everything they should remember from your interactions so far, it would likely be much longer. (Claude Fredericks, who may have been <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/11/08/the-most-ambitious-diary-in-history-claude-fredericks">the most prolific diarist in history</a>, wrote a diary of approximately 65,000 pages.) </p>



<p>Unfortunately, in standard transformer models, computation and memory cost <em>quadratically</em> with the context (though due to weight-sharing between different tokens, the number of learned parameters doesn’t have to increase), which means that increasing the context by (say) a factor of 100 will require increasing model size by a factor of 10,000. However, several <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06732">alternative transformer architectures</a> aim to achieve linear or near-linear model size scaling with the context.</p>



<p><strong>Empirical scaling of performance.</strong> The recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04615">BIG-bench paper</a> is perhaps the most comprehensive study of how large language models’ performance improves with scale. They assembled an extensive collection of tasks, each with a score normalized to (mostly) stay in the interval 0-100, with a score of zero corresponding to trivial (e.g., random) performance and a score of 100 corresponding to near-perfect performance (e.g., expert human). In many of these tasks, current models score lower than 20. We still don’t have enough data to know how truly large models behave. On the one hand, naive extrapolation suggests that we need many orders of magnitude for high performance (e.g., a score of 80 points or above). On the other hand, larger models such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311">Google PaLM</a> show evidence of “breakthrough capabilities”- performance growing super-linearly in the logarithm of size. It seems that to solve this benchmark fully, we would need at least a factor of 10 increase over the ½ Trillion parameter PaLM model.</p>



<p><strong>Comparing with the brain.</strong> Another point of comparison could be the human brain. However, human brains and artificial neural networks have very different architectures, and we don’t know how many parameters correspond to a single neuron or synapse. Scott Alexander <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/somewhat-contra-marcus-on-ai-scaling?s=r">quotes</a> <a href="https://blog.piekniewski.info/2018/08/28/fun-numbers-about-the-brain/">this estimate</a> of 100 trillion parameters on the brain’s size, which would correspond to a factor of 100-1,000 larger than current models. However, the estimate is rather hand-wavy, and even if it wasn’t, there is no reason to expect that artificial neural networks would have the same “ability per parameter” ratio as human brains. In particular, artificial neural networks appear to compensate for relatively weaker reasoning skills by ingesting a massive amount of data, and with data, the model size grows as well.</p>



<p><strong>Bottom line.</strong> Overall, it seems that X will need to be at least 10-100, though this is an extremely rough estimate. Also, while an X Trillion model might be the “core” of a system replacing a human worker, it will not be the whole of it, and we are likely to need new ideas beyond scale for these other components. In particular, a model designed for back-and-forth interaction is unlikely to simply use an auto-regressive language model as a black box, not even with chain-of-thought reasoning.</p>



<h2><strong>How much will it cost?</strong></h2>



<p>Suppose that scaling our current models by a factor of X can achieve “AGI” in the sense of yielding a system that can be as productive as humans in a wide variety of professions (say all the top remote jobs in the list from <a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/10-best-telecommuting-jobs-with-no-location-requirement-v2/">FlexJobs</a>). How much do we expect it to cost to (1) build a single system of this magnitude and (2) widely deploy it?</p>



<p>The gap between a “proof of concept” to actual deployment can be pretty significant. For example, in 2007, CMU won the urban DARPA grand challenge, while in 2012, a Google autonomous car passed a driving test. Yet a decade later, we still don’t have a significant deployment of self-driving cars. Also, as described in the book (and film) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/books/on-being-black-female-math-whizzes-during-the-space-race.html">Hidden Figures</a>, despite Moore’s law starting in the 30s, NASA still employed <a href="https://www.history.com/news/human-computers-women-at-nasa">human computers</a> until the 1960s. </p>



<p>For this post, I will make the optimistic (and unrealistic) assumption that the difference between proof-of-concept and deployments corresponds to the difference between the cost of <strong>training</strong> a system vs. the cost of doing <strong>inference</strong> on it.  If a system costs more than $100B to train, then it may never get built  (for comparison, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2012/07/05/how-much-does-it-cost-to-find-a-higgs-boson/?sh=15872c173948">Large Hadron Collider</a> cost less than $5B to build). Similarly, a system costing $1000/hour to use is unlikely to replace human workers at scale. </p>

<p></p>



<p>The costs below are calculated with today’s dollars and today’s hardware. Of course, improvements in hardware will translate to cheaper training and inference. However, we have neglected costs that can scale super-linearly with model size, including communication between nodes, managing massive clusters and more. I consider only <em>amortized</em> costs since those are what matter when training and serving models at scale.</p>



<h3><strong>Cost of training</strong></h3>



<p>There is no point in training a large model if you don’t train it for enough time. The performance advantages of larger models are realized by allowing them to train on more data without “saturating”. In the words of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556">Chinchilla</a> paper  “for every doubling of model size the number of training tokens should also be doubled.” (See also the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08127">deep bootstrap</a> paper). Hence the number of inferences applied using training also scales with the model size.  This means that if a model grows by a factor of X then both the cost of a single inference as well as the total number of inferences grow by about X, meaning that the cost of training grows by about X<sup>2</sup>.  In particular, we can expect training a model that is 100 times as large to cost 10,000 times more! </p>



<p>There are <a href="https://lambdalabs.com/blog/demystifying-gpt-3/">differing</a> <a href="https://lastweekin.ai/p/gpt-3-is-no-longer-the-only-game#:~:text=Taken%20together%2C%20these%20factors%20mean,costly%20and%20difficult%20to%20train.">estimates</a> on how much ~100B parameter GPT3 model cost to train, but they range in the $5M-$20M, let’s say $5M in pure training costs for simplicity. (This would correspond to a cost of 5M$/500B = 10<sup>-5</sup> dollars per inference, which matches roughly with estimates below.)  An X Trillion model (which, like Chinchilla, but unlike PaLM, would be fully trained to max out its advantages) might cost a factor of 100X<sup>2</sup> more. For X=10, this would be a cost of $50B. For X=100, this would be 5 Trillion dollars!</p>



<p>Clearly, finding a way to train N-sized models on N tokens using less than O(N<sup>2</sup>) steps (e.g., O(N log N) ) can be crucial for scaling larger models. Training larger language models also runs into the problem that we have nearly “maxed out” the available textual data. Modern models are already trained on hundreds of billions of words, but there is a limit to how much novel text can be produced by a planet of 8 billion people. (Though multimodal models that are also trained on video would have access to much more data.)</p>



<h2><strong>Cost per inference</strong></h2>



<p>Suppose that we have managed to train a large model of X Trillion parameters. How much do we expect inference to cost in dollars? In transformer architectures, the number of floating-point operations required to make a single model evaluation (i.e., inference) is roughly the same as the number of parameters.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6nN6SrxuKUYnW0cfxrOmcohET_FSmDrQqnQXNirPRwj95oAr0HAf6J6q6v_S8W4_gV6Efvu8fgflohbxbW66hjcmeOBzHKYK_6syfh0Sc19V0qVr_Sg7jaDICeEyM5U1tc4r2P1C6p38LJoWKQ" alt="" /><strong>Figure:</strong> Relation between the number of parameters and FLOPs, from  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05472">Desislavov et al</a>. Both axes are logarithmic. For transformers, the slope is very close to 1 (one FLOP per parameter), while for CNN’s it is roughly 0.8. </figure>



<p></p>



<p>Hence an X Trillion parameter model requires about X TerraFLOPs (TFLOPs). Nvidia’s A-100 GPUs claims peak performance of <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ampere-architecture-in-depth/">about 300</a> TFLOP/s. (The effects of using 16-bit precision and not achieving 100% utilization roughly cancel out.) Renting such a machine costs about $1/hour, so we can get about 300*3600 ~ 1M TFLOPs per dollar.  (This is up to order of magnitude and caring just about total FLOPs rather than wall-clock time; for careful calculations of inference <em>time,</em> see <a href="https://kipp.ly/blog/transformer-inference-arithmetic/">Carol Chen’s</a> and <a href="https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/how-fast-can-we-perform-a-forward-pass/">Jacob Steinhardt’s</a> blogs.)</p>



<p>So far, this sounds great – we could make 10<sup>6</sup>/X<strong> </strong> inferences per dollar for an X trillion parameter model.  However, in the real world costs are much higher. The same Nvidia blog shows that A-100 can handle 6000 inferences/sec of the 340M parameter Bert Large. Since an X Trillion model is 3000X larger, that would correspond to 2/X inferences per second or 7200/X inferences per hour/dollar. The calculations above predict that the 0.2 Trillion parameter GPT-3 would be able to perform 7200*5~35K inferences per dollar. However, OpenAI charges <a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing/">6 cents per 1K tokens</a> (including input tokens!), which depending on the length of the input, can be only 10 inferences per dollar. <a href="https://pakodas.substack.com/p/estimating-gpt3-api-cost">Bhavsar</a> estimates GPT-3 can handle about 18K inferences per GPU hour. Overall it seems that 10<sup>4</sup>/X inferences per dollar is an optimistic estimate. </p>



<p>However, the question is how many inferences we need to make per hour to simulate a human. The average person <a href="https://www.publicationcoach.com/ten-ways-to-write-a-better-speech/">apparently speaks</a> about 150 words (say 200 tokens) per minute. This would suggest we need about 200*60 ~ 10K inferences per hour to simulate a person. For an X Trillion sized model, that would cost $X per hour, which is not too bad if X is between 10 to 100.</p>



<p>The above price point sounds pretty good but will likely be an underestimate.  First, to actually simulate a human, we need not just to simulate what they say but also what they <em>think</em>. So, to perform “chain of thought” reasoning, we would need to run an inference per word that is thought rather than a word that is uttered. We don’t know the speed of thought, but it will increase the number of inferences needed. Generally, to simulate a chain of reasoning of depth K, the number of inferences scales with K, even if the end result is just a single token. Second, to reach high reliability, it is likely that we will need to make Y inferences and use some mechanism to choose the best one out of these Y options. For example, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07814">AlphaCode</a> generates millions of possible solutions to programming challenges and filters them into 10 candidate ones. It is hard to estimate what Y would be in a workplace environment, but it seems that Y would be somewhere between 10 to 100.</p>



<p><strong>Bottom line for inference cost. </strong>The estimates above suggest that an X Trillion parameter model would require about 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> inferences per hour to simulate a person, with a cost that ranges from $10X to $100X per hour. This is already tight for X=10 and would be too much for X=100. However, it is not clear how many words/thoughts we need to simulate per given profession, so these estimates are very rough.</p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2>



<p>While the estimates above should be taken with huge grains of salt, I believe that generally useful artificial intelligence can likely be achieved, but it will require more than sheer scale. While in principle a perfect next-word extender is also a perfect reinforcement learner, we may not be able to get close enough to perfection by scale alone. More than any particular conclusions, I hope that the debate can move from general philosophical arguments to quantitative questions that have numerical answers. </p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>Addendum: The “C word” and existential risk.</strong></h2>



<p>I tried to keep this post within the realms of calculations and away from philosophy. But given recent discussions and hype on whether AI systems can achieve “consciousness” or “sentience” and whether they pose a unique existential risk, I feel that I must address this at least briefly.  Readers allergic to philosophy and unjustified speculations can stop here. </p>



<p>Consciousness is a tricky concept: the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry lists <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/#SpeTheCon">nine different specific theories</a> of consciousness, and there are more theories still. It is also intertwined with ethics: if we consider a creature to be conscious or sentient, then the boundaries of how we can treat it become an issue of ethics. I don’t think it’s the job of computer scientists (or any other scientists) to come up with a moral philosophy, and similarly, I don’t think defining consciousness falls in our domain.</p>



<p>Historically, there seem to be two kinds of non-human entities which we considered conscious or sentient. One is animals, to which people have felt superior. The other is gods, to which people have felt inferior. Before we understood the causes of planetary movements, weather events, and other natural phenomena, we ascribed them to conscious actions by various gods. Since we couldn’t predict or explain these phenomena, our only attempt at controlling them was through prayer and sacrifice to the presumably conscious entity that controls them.</p>



<p>Some discussions of potential future AI are reminiscent of those past gods. According to some, AI would be not just conscious but capricious and could (according to some, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uMQ3cqWDPHhjtiesc/agi-ruin-a-list-of-lethalities">would</a>)  ensure that “everybody on the face of the Earth suddenly falls over dead within the same second.” It is of course, possible to construct hypothetical scenarios in which an AI system managed to start a nuclear war or design a lethal virus. We’ve all read such books and seen such movies. It is also possible to construct scenarios where <em>humans</em> start a nuclear war or design a lethal virus. There are also many books and movies of the latter type. In fact, many AI “doomsday scenarios” don’t seem to require super-human levels of intelligence.   </p>



<p>The truth is that the reason that our world hasn’t been destroyed so far is not that humans were not intelligent enough nor because we haven’t been malicious enough. First, throughout most of human history, we did not have technologies such as nuclear weapons and others with the potential to cause planet-scale destruction. Second, while imperfect, we have developed some institutions, including international bodies, the non-proliferation treaty, standards for biolabs, pandemic preparations, and more to keep some of these capabilities in check. Third, we were lucky. From climate change through pandemic preparation to nuclear disarmament, humanity should be doing much more to confront the risks and harms of our own making. But this is true independently of artificial intelligence. Just as with humans, my inclination with AI would not to try to make systems inherently moral or good (“aligned” in AI-speak) but rather use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify">“trust, but verify” </a>approach. One moral of computational complexity theory is that computationally weak agents can verify the computation of more powerful processes.</p>



<p>Many of the calculations above show how “scaling up” is going to be non-trivial, and it is unlikely to see AI making restaurant reservations one day, and secretly ordering material over the net to build a world-destroying nano-technology lab the next one. Even if it’s possible for a large-scale model to “train itself” to improve performance, without needing additional outside data, that model would still incur the considerable computational costs for training that we computed above. </p>



<p>In my previous post, I explained <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2022/05/23/why-i-am-not-a-longtermist/">why I am not a “longtermist”</a>.  The above is why I don’t view an “AGI run amok” as a short-term existential risk. That doesn’t mean AI doesn’t have safety issues. AI is a new technology, and with any new technology come new risks. We don’t need science fiction to see real risks in both unintentional consequences of AI deployment such as discrimination and bias, as well as intentional consequences of deploying AI for weapons, surveillance, and social manipulation. I don’t think that debating the notion of consciousness and inventing doomsday scenarios is helpful for combatting any one of those.   </p>

<p>The second preprint from my CCCG papers is now online. It is “Reflections in an octagonal mirror maze”, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11413">arXiv:2206.11413</a>. The title is quite literal: suppose you find yourself in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_mirrors">mirror maze</a>, where the mirrors are aligned with the sides of an octagon, and have integer coordinates (meaning that, on a floorplan of the maze, the mirrors become line segments between points of an integer grid). What would you see if you looked in any given direction? It might be many reflections eventually leading to the back of your own head, to the exit, or some other non-reflective part of the maze. <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mirror_Maze_in_the_Museum_of_Science%2BIndustry_of_Chicago.jpg">The example below, from the Museum of Science &amp; Industry in Chicago</a>, is hexagonal rather than octagonal, but otherwise has much the same effect:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/Chicago-mirror-maze.jpg" alt="Mirror Maze in the Museum of Science+Industry of Chicago, CC-BY-SA image by Kevdog686, 27 May 2019, from Wikimedia Commons" /></p>

<p>In this example, it looks like you might be seeing something else, not the exit or your own head: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_mirror">a corridor of infinitely many reflections</a>. But when looking in a direction of rational slope, and without tricks involving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_mirror">one-way mirrors</a> (my guess at what’s happening in the photo), that’s not actually possible. Rationality implies that there are only finitely many possible points where your view could hit a mirror: in the photo above, all the reflections down the corridor look like they are actually on the center lines of the mirrors. Because there are only finitely many of these points (in reality, if not in what you see), such a view would have to eventually repeat, in a finite cycle. And finite cycles like that are definitely possible, but you can’t see them, because putting your eye onto them blocks the view.</p>

<p>Even if you can’t see a line with infinitely many reflections, you can see a very large number of them. The number of reflections you see between your eye and whatever opaque thing eventually blocks the view cannot be bounded by any function of the number of mirrors. If you take a diagonal view into a long hallway with its two sides mirrored, the number of reflections will be proportional to the length of the hall, even though there are only two mirrors. And with larger numbers of mirrors, more complex patterns of reflection can occur.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/8reflex.svg" alt="Complex patterns of reflection in an octagonal mirror maze" /></p>

<p>Because the number of reflections can be large, finding the eventual fate of a reflected light path by directly simulating the sequence of reflections any ray might take could be very slow. Instead, my new paper shows that it can be done in polynomial time! More precisely the time is polynomial in the number of mirrors and in the number of bits needed to specify a mirror coordinates or viewpoint direction using binary numbers.</p>

<p>Although the problem is simple to state, the solution uses sophisticated methods from computational topology. It’s an application of <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2022/01/30/fast-iterated-exchange.html">an idea from an earlier post</a>, originally by Mark Bell, and included in an update to my earlier preprint “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11607">The Complexity of Iterated Reversible Computation</a>”. This idea concerns <em>iterated integer interval exchange transformations</em>: if you have a function on an interval of integers that acts by permuting subintervals, then how easy is it to compute the result of applying the same function many times? As Bell observed, this computation could be transformed into an equivalent problems of tracing normal curves on a topological surface, which had been solved in earlier work by Erickson and Nayyeri. The new paper generalizes these integer transformations to partial functions, extends the same method to compute iterated values of these partial functions, and shows that these partial functions can be used to model the way the mirrors in a mirror maze permute sightlines.</p>

<p>In 1973, the US Supreme Court enshrined the right to abortion—considered by me and ~95% of everyone I know to be a basic pillar of modernity—in such a way that the right could be overturned only if its opponents could somehow gain permanent minority rule, and thereby disregard the wills of three-quarters of Americans.  So now, half a century later, that’s precisely what they’ve done.  Because Ruth Bader Ginsburg didn’t live three more weeks, we’re now faced with a civilizational crisis, with tens of millions of liberals and moderates in the red states now under the authority of a social contract that they never signed.  With this backwards leap, Curtis Yarvin’s notion that <a href="https://leviathan-supersystem.tumblr.com/post/164980251514/what-does-the-nrx-meme-cthulhu-swims-left-mean">“Cthulhu only ever swims leftward”</a> stands as decimated by events as any thesis has ever been.  I wonder whether Yarvin is happy to have been so thoroughly refuted.</p>



<p>Most obviously for me, the continued viability of Texas as a place for science, for research, for technology companies, is now in severe doubt.  Already this year, our 50-member CS department at UT Austin has had faculty members leave, and faculty candidates turn us down, with abortion being the stated reason, and I expect that to accelerate.  Just last night my wife, Dana Moshkovitz, presented a proposal at the STOC business meeting to host STOC’2024 at a beautiful family-friendly resort outside Austin.  The proposal failed, in part because of the argument that, if a pregnant STOC attendee faced a life-threatening medical condition, Texas doctors might choose to let her die, or the attendee might be charged with murder for having a miscarriage.  In other words: Texas (and indeed, half the US) will apparently soon be like Donetsk or North Korea, dangerous for Blue Americans to visit even for just a few days.  To my fellow Texans, I say: if you find that hyperbolic, <em>understand that this is how the blue part of the country now sees you</em>.  Understand that only a restoration of the previous social contract can reverse it.</p>



<p>Of course, this destruction of everything some of us have tried to build in science in Texas is happening despite the fact that 47-48% of Texans actually vote Democratic.  It’s happening despite the fact that, if Blue Americans wanted to stop it, the obvious way to do so would be to <strong>move to Austin and Houston (and the other blue enclaves of red states) in droves, and exert their electoral power.</strong>  In other words, to do precisely what Dana and I did.  But can I urge others to do the same with a straight face?</p>



<p>As far as I can tell, the only hope at this point of averting a cold Civil War is if, against all odds, there’s a Democratic landslide in Congress, sufficient to get the right to abortion enshrined into federal law.  Given the ways both the House and the Senate are stacked against Democrats, I don’t expect that anytime soon, but I’ll work for it—and will do so even if many of the people I’m working with me despise me for other reasons.  I will match reader donations to Democratic PACs and Congressional campaigns (not necessarily the same ones, though feel free to advocate for your favorites), announced in the comment section of this post, up to a limit of $10,000.</p></div>

We make progress on understanding a lower bound technique that was recently used by the authors to prove the first superpolynomial constant-depth circuit lower bounds against algebraic circuits. 

More specifically, our previous work applied the well-known partial derivative method in a new setting, that of 'lopsided' set-multilinear polynomials. A set-multilinear polynomial $P\in F[X_1,\ldots,X_d]$ (for disjoint sets of variables $X_1,\ldots,X_d$) is a linear combination of monomials, each of which contains one variable from $X_1,\ldots,X_d$. A lopsided space of set-multilinear polynomials is one where the sets $X_1,\ldots,X_d$ are allowed to have different sizes (we use the adjective `lopsided' to stress this feature). By choosing a suitable lopsided space of polynomials, and using a suitable version of the partial-derivative method for proving lower bounds, we were able to prove constant-depth superpolynomial set-multilinear formula lower bounds even for very low-degree polynomials (as long as $d$ is a growing function of the number of variables $N$). This in turn implied lower bounds against general formulas of constant-depth.

A priori, there is nothing stopping these techniques from giving us lower bounds against algebraic formulas of 'any' depth. We investigate the extent to which this lower bound can extend to greater depths. We prove the following results.


** We observe that our choice of the lopsided space and the kind of partial-derivative method used can be modelled as the choice of a multiset $W\subseteq [-1,1]$ of size $d$. Our first result completely characterizes, for any product-depth $\Delta,$ the best lower bound we can prove for set-multilinear formulas of product-depth $\Delta$ in terms of some combinatorial properties of $W$, that we call the 'depth-$\Delta$ tree bias' of $W$.

** We show that the maximum depth-$3$ tree bias, over multisets $W$ of size $d$, is $\Theta(d^{1/4}).$ This shows a stronger formula lower bound of $N^{\Omega(d^{1/4})}$ for set-multilinear formulas of product-depth $3$, and also puts a non-trivial constraint on the best lower bounds we can hope to prove at this depth in this framework (a priori, we could have hoped to prove a lower bound of $N^{\Omega(\Delta d^{1/\Delta})}$ at product-depth $\Delta$).

** Finally, we show that for small $\Delta,$ our proof technique cannot hope to prove lower bounds of the form $N^{\Omega(d^{1/\poly(\Delta)})}.$ This seems to strongly hint that new ideas will be required to prove lower bounds for formulas of unbounded depth.</div>
