Aram Harrow, Avinatan Hassidim, and Seth Lloyd are quantum stars who have done many other things as well. They are jointly famous for their 2009 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.3171.pdf">paper</a>, “Quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations.”</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I discuss an aspect of their paper that speaks to a wider context.</p>
<p>
The paper by Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd addresses a fundamental problem: given an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN+%5Ctimes+N%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N \times N}" class="latex" title="{N \times N}" /> matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> and an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" />-vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b}" class="latex" title="{b}" />, solve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BAx+%3D+b%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Ax = b}" class="latex" title="{Ax = b}" />. This is called the Linear Systems Problem (LSP). They say in their abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Here, we exhibit a quantum algorithm for this task that runs in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bpoly%28log+N%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{poly(log N)}" class="latex" title="{poly(log N)}" /> time, an exponential improvement over the best classical algorithm. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
What strikes us is what HHL meant by “this task” in their abstract. It is not LSP. Indeed, it can’t be LSP. They want to do it with a number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> of qubits that is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cll+N%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\ll N}" class="latex" title="{\ll N}" />.

No matter how much you entangle and wrangle, you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holevo's_theorem#Comments_and_remarks">cannot</a> extract more than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> bits of information out of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> qubits. So even if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n)}" class="latex" title="{O(n)}" />-sparse in some sense, and ignoring the issue of the time it would take to output the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" /> entries of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" />, you can’t solve LSP with fewer qubits to get all of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> in the first place. </p>

</p><p></p><h2> It’s a Changed Problem </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What a solution to QLSP gives you is not <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> but a quantum state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%5Cxi%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{|\xi\rangle}" class="latex" title="{|\xi\rangle}" /> that approximates the unit-vector multiple of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" />. As HHL say earlier in their abstract, this changed problem is useful if what you really want is not <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> but some other value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f(x)}" class="latex" title="{f(x)}" /> derived from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" />. They say for example that desired information could come from a quantum measurement of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" />—that is, of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%5Cxi%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{|\xi\rangle}" class="latex" title="{|\xi\rangle}" />. </p>
<p>
This blog did have a 2012 <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/04/04/a-lazy-approach-to-problem-solving/">post</a> on “lazy problem solving” that included the quip: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The idea is that when we solve a system <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BAx+%3D+b%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Ax = b}" class="latex" title="{Ax = b}" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" />, it is likely that we do not really want <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" />.

The question we plan to address is, are there algorithms that can do this faster than solving the entire linear system? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Ironically, the problem we suggested there, which is computing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csum_i+x_i%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sum_i x_i^2}" class="latex" title="{\sum_i x_i^2}" /> up to multiplicative error <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1+%5Cpm+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1 \pm \epsilon}" class="latex" title="{1 \pm \epsilon}" />, is destroyed by normalizing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> into a quantum state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%5Cxi%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{|\xi\rangle}" class="latex" title="{|\xi\rangle}" />. Oh well. But <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/02/26/problems-not-algorithms/">other</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/07/21/shifts-in-algorithm-design/">posts</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/04/30/transcomputational-problems/">have</a> considered changing the objectives of algorithms. But the general idea involved in the formulation of QLSP strikes us anew—and in ways different from Scott Aaronson’s caveats in a wonderful <a href="https://scottaaronson.com/papers/qml.pdf">review</a> he wrote of HHL titled, “Quantum Machine Learning Algorithms: Read the Fine Print.” </p>
<p>
Going from LSP to QLSP switches the problem and enables showing that a quantum algorithm can solve the switched problem much faster than before. Very nice: HHL and its followups deserving of myriad citations. Scott’s review frames the question of whether the switch is fair from a practical perspective, including the restrictions on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b}" class="latex" title="{b}" />. Perhaps the jury is still out on this: we’ve mentioned several times the nifty <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04271">result</a> by Ewin Tang that found a quick classical solution to a <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/8/238339-the-algorithm-that-changed-quantum-machine-learning/fulltext">problem</a> downstream of HHL that had been thought to require quantum. But switching a problem for research is fair—we do this all time in theory. We hope that the modified problem helps us understand the original problem. Let’s look at some examples.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Ketted Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We think the general recipe will be clear from a couple more examples. The first one seems not to be the same as what is called “QSAT” <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.6161.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/108412">here</a>. </p>
<p></p><p><br />
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" title="{\bullet}" /> “Ketted SAT”: Given a CNF formula <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\Phi}" class="latex" title="{\Phi}" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^n}" class="latex" title="{2^n}" /> variables but <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7BO%281%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n^{O(1)}}" class="latex" title="{n^{O(1)}}" />-sized clauses, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon &gt; 0}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon &gt; 0}" />, output a quantum state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%5Cxi%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{|\xi\rangle}" class="latex" title="{|\xi\rangle}" /> such that for some satisfying assignment <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%7C%5C%3B%7C%5Cxi%5Crangle+-+%7C%5Cfrac%7Bx%7D%7B%7C%7Cx%7C%7C_2%7D%5Crangle+%7C%7C_2+%5Cleq+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{||\;|\xi\rangle - |\frac{x}{||x||_2}\rangle ||_2 \leq \epsilon}" class="latex" title="{||\;|\xi\rangle - |\frac{x}{||x||_2}\rangle ||_2 \leq \epsilon}" />. </p>
<p>
We still suspect this is known at least implicitly in the context of interactive proofs and PCPs and error-correcting codes. In that context, the idea of getting an assignment within distance <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon}" /> of a satisfying one might make sense. For other purposes it is not so useful—e.g., it might not help utiliize the self-reducibility structure of SAT. It may simply be equivalent to known succinct-SAT problems after applying the coding used to obtain <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/PAPERS/holographic.pdf">holographic proofs</a>, but we don’t immediately see it.</p>
<p>
Note that the fact of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\Phi}" class="latex" title="{\Phi}" /> being in CNF with small clause size (which can even be constant) mirrors the sparseness condition on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> that is usually assumed in cases of HHL. So the analogy to QLSP holds up there. At least “ketted SAT” is a different problem.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" title="{\bullet}" /> “Ketted Factoring”: Given a really large integer <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M}" class="latex" title="{M}" />, output a quantum state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%5Cpi%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{|\pi\rangle}" class="latex" title="{|\pi\rangle}" /> such that for some nontrivial (prime) factor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M}" class="latex" title="{M}" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%7C%5C%3B%7C%5Cpi%5Crangle+-+k%28p%29%7C%7C+%3C+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{||\;|\pi\rangle - k(p)|| &lt; \epsilon}" class="latex" title="{||\;|\pi\rangle - k(p)|| &lt; \epsilon}" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%28p%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bi%3A+bin%28p%2Ci%29+%3D+1%7D+%7Ci%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k(p) = \sum_{i: bin(p,i) = 1} |i\rangle}" class="latex" title="{k(p) = \sum_{i: bin(p,i) = 1} |i\rangle}" />.</p>
<p>
We can suppose that we have oracle lookup to bits of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M}" class="latex" title="{M}" />, so that all the bits can be placed into quantum superposition. We could alternatively encode <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M}" class="latex" title="{M}" /> as the quantum state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%28M%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bi%3A+bin%28N%2Ci%29+%3D+1%7D+%7Ci%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k(M) = \sum_{i: bin(N,i) = 1} |i\rangle}" class="latex" title="{k(M) = \sum_{i: bin(N,i) = 1} |i\rangle}" />, but then the problem might not be well-defined because <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%28M%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k(M)}" class="latex" title="{k(M)}" /> cannot retain all info about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M}" class="latex" title="{M}" />. </p>
<p>
This is not in the shadow of Shor’s algorithm because that needs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M}" class="latex" title="{M}" /> to have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n)}" class="latex" title="{O(n)}" /> digits in order eventually to get a factor exactly. The quantumized version applies when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M}" class="latex" title="{M}" /> is really big. Again, it is not clear that the solutions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%5Cpi%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{|\pi\rangle}" class="latex" title="{|\pi\rangle}" /> would be useful for things like breaking cryptosystems. They might represent points of cryptographic weakness in some detailed sense. In any event, it’s a different problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> More General Changed Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
With all of these there are questions about how far the change reflects on the original problem, but at least the change generated substantial research and interesting new angles.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h3> The Goldbach problem </h3><p></p>
<p><i>Every even number is the sum of two primes</i> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7E%5Crightarrow%7E%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{~\rightarrow~}" class="latex" title="{~\rightarrow~}" /> <i>Every even number is the sum of two almost-primes</i>.</p>
<p>
A number is an almost prime if it is a prime or a product of at most two primes. This is a quite useful result, but not what we really believe is true.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h3> P=NP </h3><p></p>
<p><i><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P}}" /> not equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" /></i> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7E%5Crightarrow%7E%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{~\rightarrow~}" class="latex" title="{~\rightarrow~}" /> <i><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%5E%7BA%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P}^{A}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P}^{A}}" /> not equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%5E%7BA%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}^{A}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}^{A}}" /></i>.</p>
<p>
This says that if we relativize to some oracle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P}}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" /> are not equal. This is a famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine">result</a> of Theodore Baker, John Gill, and Robert Solovay. It sheds light on the structure of algorithms, but does not rule out that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P}}" /> could still equal <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" />.</p>
<p>

Actually, Terence Tao got a cool result this year only by making a second change. In his <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03562.pdf">paper</a> “Almost All Orbits Of The Collatz Map Attain Almost Bounded Values” he proves that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BColmin+%28N%29+%3C+f%28n%29+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Colmin (N) &lt; f(n) }" class="latex" title="{Colmin (N) &lt; f(n) }" /> for almost all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" /> and any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f(n)}" class="latex" title="{f(n)}" /> that tends to infinity.

<p></p><p>
We come full circle back to quantum computing. This week there has been much hubbub over a prematurely-released <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/h9oBikj/quantum-supremacy-using-a-programmable-superconducting-processor.pdf">announcement</a> that Google researchers have built a quantum device able to complete probabilistic searches that are not feasible by any classical computer. If one goes back to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.5813.pdf">origins</a> of the <a href="https://quantumfrontiers.com/2012/07/22/supremacy-now/">term</a> “quantum supremacy” in 2012, before Google’s approach was conceived in 2015, one can say the change is:</p>
<p>
<i>specific physical simulation or complexity-based problems</i> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7E%5Crightarrow%7E%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{~\rightarrow~}" class="latex" title="{~\rightarrow~}" /> <i>randomized problems</i>.</p>
<p>
Scott has a great <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4317">post</a> with preliminary descriptions and evaluations, and we confess to adapting the following telegraphic evocation of how it works from Ryan O’Donnell and others in the comments section: Given a randomly-generated probability distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{D}" class="latex" title="{D}" /> on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\{0,1\}^n}" class="latex" title="{\{0,1\}^n}" />, call <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> “<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{D}" class="latex" title="{D}" />-heavy” if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{D}" class="latex" title="{D}" /> gives it probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%2F2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b/2^n}" class="latex" title="{b/2^n}" /> for some fixed <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb+%3E+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b &gt; 1}" class="latex" title="{b &gt; 1}" />. Even given <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{D}" class="latex" title="{D}" /> in white-box form via an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />-qubit quantum circuit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C}" class="latex" title="{C}" /> with randomly placed gates, it is evidently hard (compare <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04402.pdf">this</a>) for a classical computer to find heavy strings with frequency <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3E+1%2Fe+%2B+%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{&gt; 1/e + \delta}" class="latex" title="{&gt; 1/e + \delta}" />, concretely for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3D+53%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n = 53}" class="latex" title="{n = 53}" />. Google’s quantum machine, which is effectively programmed by the user presenting the random <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C}" class="latex" title="{C}" />, can however find heavy strings with frequency <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2Fe+%2B+%5CDelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1/e + \Delta}" class="latex" title="{1/e + \Delta}" /> with a highly significant separation between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CDelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\Delta}" class="latex" title="{\Delta}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta}" class="latex" title="{\delta}" />. We surmise that exhaustive tests over classical circuits trying the search at smaller values of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> have witnessed the smaller <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta}" class="latex" title="{\delta}" /> value at those <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />.</p>
<p>
Again, this approach is different from demonstrating a specific computable function to separate classical and quantum and from the instances considered in the concluding <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/10/03/quantum-supremacy-or-classical-control/">post</a>, with “supremacy” in its title, of our eight-part series in 2012 between Gil Kalai and, yes, Aram Harrow.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Is our general notion of “ketted problems” useful? Ketted SAT and Factoring lack the natural continuity in (Q)LSP, but at least for SAT it can be grafted on by composing the formula with an error-correcting code. There is still the issue of being able to extract less classical information from the ketted approximations.</p>
<p>
We note a theory <a href="https://www.pims.math.ca/scientific-event/190928-ntd2paul">workshop</a> being held this Saturday at UW Seattle in honor of Paul Beame’s 60th birthday. We congratulate Paul on both.</p>

By now you've probably heard the rumors of Google achieving quantum supremacy. I don't have inside information outside of <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4317">Scott's blog post</a> but it looks like the news should be <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2006/10/embargoed-science.html">embargoed</a> until the release of a Science or Nature paper. These things usually happen on a Tuesday and you'd think they would avoid the news of the Nobel Prize announcements October 7-14.<br />
<br />
Since for now the Google paper doesn't officially exist, we live in an era of Classical Dominance. Any problem that can be solved on a quantum computer today, can be solved just as fast or faster on a traditional computer. Quantum Supremacy, despite its lofty name, is just the negation of Classical Dominance, that there is some problem that a current quantum machine can solve that all our regular machines would require a considerably longer time to solve. This isn't a formal mathematical or scientific definition, so one can debate when or if we cross this threshold and I'm sure <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/23/quantum-computers-amazing-progress-google-ibm-and-extraordinary-but-probably-false-supremacy-claims-google/">people will</a>.<br />
<br />
Quantum Supremacy might not even be a monotone concept. Future classical algorithms might solve the problem quickly, leading us back to Classical Dominance but leaving open the possibility of returning to Quantum Supremacy with another problem.<br />
<br />
Quantum Supremacy is a long way from Quantum Usefulness, where quantum machines can solve problems we care about faster that traditional machines. Quantum computing will truly reach its potential when we can run general quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm to factor products of large primes. We'll probably never see Quantum Dominance where classical transistors go the way of vacuum tubes.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, quantum supremacy is an important step and whether or not you think Google has gotten there, I'm sure it's an incredible achievement of science and engineering.</div>

for a given additive manufacturing (AM) process. Different AM technologies,
process parameters or materials introduce geometric constraints on what is
manufacturable or not. Given an input 3D model and minimum printable feature
size dictated by the manufacturing process characteristics and parameters, our
algorithm generates a corrected geometry that is printable with the intended AM
process. A key issue in model correction for manufacturability is the
identification of critical features that are affected by the printing process.
To address this challenge, we propose a topology aware approach to construct
the allowable space for a print head to traverse during the 3D printing
process. Combined with our build orientation optimization algorithm, the amount
of modifications performed on the shape is kept at minimum while providing an
accurate approximation of the as-manufactured part. We demonstrate our method
on a variety of 3D models and validate it by 3D printing the results.

$(1+\epsilon)f$-approximate minimum cost set cover with
$O(f\log(Cn)/\epsilon^2)$ amortized update time, when the input set system is
undergoing element insertions and deletions. Here, $n$ denotes the number of
elements, each element appears in at most $f$ sets, and the cost of each set
lies in the range $[1/C, 1]$. Our result, together with that of Gupta et al.
[STOC`17], implies that there is a deterministic algorithm for this problem
with $O(f\log(Cn))$ amortized update time and $O(\min(\log n,
f))$-approximation ratio, which nearly matches the polynomial-time hardness of
approximation for minimum set cover in the static setting. Our update time is
only $O(\log (Cn))$ away from a trivial lower bound.
</p>
<p>Prior to our work, the previous best approximation ratio guaranteed by
deterministic algorithms was $O(f^2)$, which was due to Bhattacharya et al.
[ICALP`15]. In contrast, the only result that guaranteed $O(f)$-approximation
was obtained very recently by Abboud et al. [STOC`19], who designed a dynamic
algorithm with $(1+\epsilon)f$-approximation ratio and $O(f^2 \log n/\epsilon)$
amortized update time. Besides the extra $O(f)$ factor in the update time
compared to our and Gupta et al.'s results, the Abboud et al. algorithm is
randomized, and works only when the adversary is oblivious and the sets are
unweighted (each set has the same cost).
</p>
<p>We achieve our result via the primal-dual approach, by maintaining a
fractional packing solution as a dual certificate. Unlike previous primal-dual
algorithms that try to satisfy some local constraints for individual sets at
all time, our algorithm basically waits until the dual solution changes
significantly globally, and fixes the solution only where the fix is needed.

patterns from a given dictionary $\mathcal{D}$ in fragments of a given string
$T$ of length $n$. The dictionary is internal in the sense that each pattern in
$\mathcal{D}$ is given as a fragment of $T$. This way, $\mathcal{D}$ takes
space proportional to the number of patterns $d=|\mathcal{D}|$ rather than
their total length, which could be $\Theta(n\cdot d)$.
</p>
<p>In particular, we consider the following types of queries: reporting and
counting all occurrences of patterns from $\mathcal{D}$ in a fragment $T[i..j]$
and reporting distinct patterns from $\mathcal{D}$ that occur in $T[i..j]$. We
show how to construct, in $\mathcal{O}((n+d) \log^{\mathcal{O}(1)} n)$ time, a
data structure that answers each of these queries in time
$\mathcal{O}(\log^{\mathcal{O}(1)} n+|output|)$.
</p>
<p>The case of counting patterns is much more involved and needs a combination
of a locally consistent parsing with orthogonal range searching. Reporting
distinct patterns, on the other hand, uses the structure of maximal repetitions
in strings. Finally, we provide tight---up to subpolynomial factors---upper and
lower bounds for the case of a dynamic dictionary.

class of Flajolet-Martin algorithms (FMa), and provide a exact analytical
confidence interval for the number $F_0$ of distinct elements in a stream,
based on Chernoff bounds. The class of FMa has reached a significant popularity
in bigdata stream learning, and the attention of the literature has mainly been
based on algorithmic aspects, basically complexity optimality, while the
statistical analysis of these class of algorithms has been often faced
heuristically. The analysis provided here shows a deep connections with special
mathematical functions and with extreme value theory. The latter connection may
help in explaining heuristic considerations, while the first opens many
numerical issues, faced at the end of the present paper. Finally, MonteCarlo
simulations are provided to support our analytical choice in this context.

system which consists of multiple UAV base stations (BSs) cooperating the
terrestrial BSs. In such a heterogeneous network, for cellular operators, the
problem is how to determine the appropriate number, locations, and altitudes of
UAV-BSs to improve the system sumrate as well as satisfy the demands of
arbitrarily flash crowds on data rates. We propose a data-driven 3D placement

computational cost. The proposed algorithm searches for the appropriate number,
location, coverage, and altitude of each UAV-BS in the serving area with the
maximized system sumrate in polynomial time so as to guarantee the minimum data
rate requirement of UE. The simulation results show that the proposed approach
can improve system sumrate in comparison with the case without UAV-BSs.

tensor product observable $O_1\otimes O_2\otimes \cdots \otimes O_n$ in the
output state of a shallow quantum circuit. This task is a cornerstone of
variational quantum algorithms for optimization, machine learning, and the
simulation of quantum many-body systems. Here we study its computational
complexity for constant-depth quantum circuits and three types of single-qubit
observables $O_j$ which are (a) close to the identity, (b) positive
semidefinite, (c) arbitrary. It is shown that the mean value problem admits a
classical approximation algorithm with runtime scaling as $\mathrm{poly}(n)$
and $2^{\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})}$ in cases (a,b) respectively. In case (c) we give
a linear-time algorithm for geometrically local circuits on a two-dimensional
grid. The mean value is approximated with a small relative error in case (a),
while in cases (b,c) we satisfy a less demanding additive error bound. The
algorithms are based on (respectively) Barvinok's polynomial interpolation
method, a polynomial approximation for the OR function arising from quantum
query complexity, and a Monte Carlo method combined with Matrix Product State
techniques. We also prove a technical lemma characterizing a zero-free region
for certain polynomials associated with a quantum circuit, which may be of
independent interest.

probability distributions over some alphabet. We revisit the Weighted Shortest
Common Supersequence (WSCS) problem, introduced by Amir et al. [SPIRE 2011],
that is, the SCS problem on weighted strings. In the WSCS problem, we are given
two weighted strings $W_1$ and $W_2$ and a threshold $\mathit{Freq}$ on
probability, and we are asked to compute the shortest (standard) string $S$
such that both $W_1$ and $W_2$ match subsequences of $S$ (not necessarily the
same) with probability at least $\mathit{Freq}$. Amir et al. showed that this
problem is NP-complete if the probabilities, including the threshold
$\mathit{Freq}$, are represented by their logarithms (encoded in binary). We
present an algorithm that solves the WSCS problem for two weighted strings of
length $n$ over a constant-sized alphabet in $\mathcal{O}(n^2\sqrt{z} \log{z})$
time. Notably, our upper bound matches known conditional lower bounds stating
that the WSCS problem cannot be solved in $\mathcal{O}(n^{2-\varepsilon})$ time
or in $\mathcal{O}^*(z^{0.5-\varepsilon})$ time unless there is a breakthrough
improving upon long-standing upper bounds for fundamental NP-hard problems
(CNF-SAT and Subset Sum, respectively). We also discover a fundamental
difference between the WSCS problem and the Weighted Longest Common Subsequence
(WLCS) problem, introduced by Amir et al. [JDA 2010]. We show that the WLCS
problem cannot be solved in $\mathcal{O}(n^{f(z)})$ time, for any function
$f(z)$, unless $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{NP}$.

\emph{submodular optimization} and \emph{online learning}. Submodular functions
play a vital role in modelling cost functions that naturally arise in many
areas of discrete optimization. These functions have been studied under various
models of computation. Independently, submodularity has been considered in
continuous domains. In fact, many problems arising in machine learning and
statistics have been modelled using continuous DR-submodular functions. In this
work, we are study the problem of maximizing \textit{non-monotone} continuous
DR-submodular functions within the framework of online learning. We provide
three main results.
</p>
<p>First, we present an online algorithm (in full-information setting) that
achieves an approximation guarantee (depending on the search space) for the
problem of maximizing non-monotone continuous DR-submodular functions over a
\emph{general} convex domain. To best of our knowledge, no prior approximation
algorithm in full-information setting was known for the non-monotone continuous
DR submodular functions even for the \emph{down-closed} convex domain.
</p>
<p>Second, we show that the online stochastic mirror ascent algorithm (in full
information setting) achieves an improved approximation ratio of $(1/4)$ for
maximizing the non-monotone continuous DR-submodular functions over a
\emph{down-closed} convex domain.
</p>
<p>At last, we extend our second result to the bandit setting where we present
the first approximation guarantee of $(1/4)$. To best of our knowledge, no
approximation algorithm for non-monotone submodular maximization was known in
the bandit setting.

the early 1990s. Since then, dozens of algorithms for computing various types
of quasiperiodicity were proposed. Our work is a step towards answering the
question: "Which algorithm for computing quasiperiods to choose in practice?".
The central notions of quasiperiodicity are covers and seeds. We implement
algorithms for computing covers and seeds in the original and in new simplified
versions and compare their efficiency on various types of data. We also discuss
other known types of quasiperiodicity, distinguish partial covers as currently
the most promising for large real-world data, and check their effectiveness
using real-world data.

the late work minimization problem, there are identical parallel machines and
the jobs have a common due date. The objective is to minimize the late work,
defined as the sum of the portion of the jobs done after the due date. A
related problem is the maximization of the early work, defined as the sum of
the portion of the jobs done before the due date. We describe a polynomial time
approximation scheme for the early work maximization problem, and we extended
it to the late work minimization problem after shifting the objective function
by a positive value that depends on the problem data. We also prove an
inapproximability result for the latter problem if the objective function is
shifted by a constant which does not depend on the input. These results remain
valid even if the number of the jobs assigned to the same machine is bounded.
This leads to an extension of our approximation scheme to some variants of the
resource leveling problem, for which no approximation algorithms were known.

fashion and with as little communication as possible. We study this problem in
the anonymized model of Ishai et al. (FOCS 2006) where each party may broadcast
anonymous messages on an insecure channel.
</p>
<p>We present a new analysis of the one-round ``split and mix'' protocol of
Ishai et al. In order to achieve the same security parameter, our analysis
reduces the required number of messages by a $\Theta(\log n)$ multiplicative
factor. We complement our positive result with lower bounds showing that the
dependence of the number of messages on the domain size, the number of parties,
and the security parameter is essentially tight.
</p>
<p>Using a reduction of Balle et al. (2019), our improved analysis of the
protocol of Ishai et al. yields, in the same model, an $\left(\varepsilon,
\delta\right)$-differentially private protocol for aggregation that, for any
constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and any $\delta = \frac{1}{\mathrm{poly}(n)}$,
incurs only a constant error and requires only a constant number of messages
per party. Previously, such a protocol was known only for $\Omega(\log n)$
messages per party.

\mathbb{R}^d$ with $|A| = |B|$ is the minimum total Euclidean distance of any
perfect matching between $A$ and $B$. One of its generalizations is asymmetric
EMD, which is the minimum total Euclidean distance of any matching of size
$|A|$ between sets of points $A,B \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ with $|A| \leq |B|$.
The problems of computing EMD and asymmetric EMD are well-studied and have many
applications in computer science, some of which also ask for the EMD-optimal
matching itself. Unfortunately, all known algorithms require at least quadratic
time to compute EMD exactly. Approximation algorithms with nearly linear time
complexity in $n$ are known (even for finding approximately optimal matchings),
but suffer from exponential dependence on the dimension.
</p>
<p>In this paper we show that significant improvements in exact and approximate
algorithms for EMD would contradict conjectures in fine-grained complexity. In
particular, we prove the following results:
</p>
<p>(1) Under the Orthogonal Vectors Conjecture, there is some $c&gt;0$ such that
EMD in $\Omega(c^{\log^* n})$ dimensions cannot be computed in truly
subquadratic time.
</p>
<p>(2) Under the Hitting Set Conjecture, for every $\delta&gt;0$, no truly
subquadratic time algorithm can find a $(1 + 1/n^\delta)$-approximate EMD
matching in $\omega(\log n)$ dimensions.
</p>
<p>(3) Under the Hitting Set Conjecture, for every $\eta = 1/\omega(\log n)$, no
truly subquadratic time algorithm can find a $(1 + \eta)$-approximate
asymmetric EMD matching in $\omega(\log n)$ dimensions.

compressible inviscid flows with shocks. The mesh resolution in regions of flow
discontinuities is increased by using a variational optimiser to $r$-adapt the
mesh and cluster degrees of freedom there. In regions of smooth flow, we
locally increase or decrease the local resolution through increasing or
decreasing the polynomial order of the elements. This dual approach allows us
to take advantage of the strengths of both methods for best computational
performance, thereby reducing the overall cost of the simulation. The
adaptation workflow uses a sensor for both discontinuities and smooth regions
that is cheap to calculate, but the framework is general and could be used in
conjunction with other feature-based sensors or error estimators. We
demonstrate this proof-of-concept using two geometries at transonic and
supersonic flow regimes. The method was implemented in the open-source
spectral/$hp$ element framework Nektar++, and its dedicated high-order mesh
generation tool NekMesh. The results show that the proposed $rp$-adaptation
methodology is a reasonably cost-effective way of improving accuracy.

compact convex space to itself has a fixed point. Roughgarden and Weinstein
(FOCS 2016) initiated the study of fixed point computation in the two-player
communication model, where each player gets a function from $[0,1]^n$ to
$[0,1]^n$, and their goal is to find an approximate fixed point of the
composition of the two functions. They left it as an open question to show a
lower bound of $2^{\Omega(n)}$ for the (randomized) communication complexity of
this problem, in the range of parameters which make it a total search problem.
We answer this question affirmatively.
</p>
<p>Additionally, we introduce two natural fixed point problems in the two-player
communication model.
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ Each player is given a function from $[0,1]^n$ to $[0,1]^{n/2}$,
and their goal is to find an approximate fixed point of the concatenation of
the functions.
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ Each player is given a function from $[0,1]^n$ to $[0,1]^{n}$, and
their goal is to find an approximate fixed point of the interpolation of the
functions.
</p>
<p>We show a randomized communication complexity lower bound of $2^{\Omega(n)}$
for these problems (for some constant approximation factor).
</p>
<p>Finally, we initiate the study of finding a panchromatic simplex in a
Sperner-coloring of a triangulation (guaranteed by Sperner's lemma) in the
two-player communication model: A triangulation $T$ of the $d$-simplex is
publicly known and one player is given a set $S_A\subset T$ and a coloring
function from $S_A$ to $\{0,\ldots ,d/2\}$, and the other player is given a set
$S_B\subset T$ and a coloring function from $S_B$ to $\{d/2+1,\ldots ,d\}$,
such that $S_A\dot\cup S_B=T$, and their goal is to find a panchromatic
simplex. We show a randomized communication complexity lower bound of
$|T|^{\Omega(1)}$ for the aforementioned problem as well.

edge insertions and deletions: given two sets of nodes $I$ and $J$, return the
distances between every pair of nodes in $I\times J$. This query is rather
general and captures several versions of the dynamic shortest paths problem. In
this paper, we develop an efficient $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for
this query using fast matrix multiplication. Our algorithm leads to answers for
some open problems for Single-Source and All-Pairs Shortest Paths (SSSP and
APSP), as well as for Diameter, Radius, and Eccentricities. Below are some
highlights. Note that all our algorithms guarantee worst-case update time and
are randomized (Monte Carlo), but do not need the oblivious adversary
assumption.
</p>
<p>Subquadratic update time for SSSP, Diameter, Centralities, ect.: When we want
to maintain distances from a single node explicitly (without queries), a
fundamental question is to beat trivially calling Dijkstra's static algorithm
after each update, taking $\Theta(n^2)$ update time on dense graphs. It was
known to be improbable for exact algorithms and for combinatorial
any-approximation algorithms to polynomially beat the $\Omega(n^2)$ bound
(under some conjectures) [Roditty, Zwick, ESA'04; Abboud, V. Williams,
FOCS'14]. Our algorithm with $I=\{s\}$ and $J=V(G)$ implies a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for this, guaranteeing $\tilde
O(n^{1.823}/\epsilon^2)$ worst-case update time for directed graphs with
positive real weights in $[1, W]$. With ideas from [Roditty, V. Williams,
STOC'13], we also obtain the first subquadratic worst-case update time for
$(5/3+\epsilon)$-approximating the eccentricities and
$(1.5+\epsilon)$-approximating the diameter and radius for unweighted graphs
(with small additive errors).

similarity joins we study the following problem: Given parameters
$d\in\mathbb{N}$, $\alpha&gt;\beta\geq 0$ and unit vectors $x,y\in \mathbb{R}^{d}$
consider the task of distinguishing between the cases $\langle x,
y\rangle\leq\beta$ and $\langle x, y\rangle\geq \alpha$ where $\langle x,
y\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^d x_i y_i$ is the inner product of vectors $x$ and $y$.
The goal is to distinguish these cases with information on each vector encoded
independently in a bit string of the shortest length possible. This problem can
be solved in general via estimating $\langle x, y\rangle$ with an additive
error bounded by $\varepsilon = \alpha - \beta$. We show that $d \log_2
\left(\tfrac{\sqrt{1-\beta}}{\varepsilon}\right) \pm \Theta(d)$ bits of
information about each vector is necessary and sufficient. Our upper bound is
constructive and improves a known upper bound of $d \log_2(1/\varepsilon) +
O(d)$ by up to a factor of 2 when $\beta$ is close to $1$. The lower bound
holds even in a stronger model where one of the vectors is known exactly, and
an arbitrary estimation function is allowed.

nodes $P(k)$ with degree $k$ satisfies the power law $P(k) \propto k^{-\gamma}
\text{ for } k &gt; k_{min} &gt; 0$. Preferential attachment is the mechanism that
has been considered responsible for such organization of these networks. In
many real networks, degree distribution before the $k_{min}$ varies very slowly
to the extent of being uniform as compared with the degree distribution for $k
&gt; k_{min}$ . In this paper, we proposed a model that describe this particular
degree distribution for the whole range of $k&gt;0$. We adopt a two step approach.
In the first step, at every time stamp we add a new node to the network and
attach it with an existing node using preferential attachment method. In the
second step, we add edges between existing pairs of nodes with the node
selection based on the uniform probability distribution. Our approach generates
weakly scale-free networks that closely follow the degree distribution of
real-world networks. We perform comprehensive mathematical analysis of the
model in the discrete domain and compare the degree distribution generated by
these models with that of real-world networks.

positive rate which can be efficiently list-decoded from any combination of
$\gamma$ fraction of insertions and $\delta$ fraction of deletions as long as
$\gamma+2\delta\leq 1-\varepsilon$. On the other hand, for any $\gamma, \delta$
with $\gamma+2\delta=1$ list-decoding is impossible. Our result thus precisely
characterizes the feasibility region of binary list-decodable codes for
insertions and deletions.
</p>
<p>We further generalize our result to codes over any finite alphabet of size
$q$. Surprisingly, our work reveals that the feasibility region for $q&gt;2$ is
not the natural generalization of the binary bound above. We provide tight
upper and lower bounds that precisely pin down the feasibility region, which
turns out to have a $(q-1)$-piece-wise linear boundary whose $q$ corner-points
lie on a quadratic curve.
</p>
<p>The main technical work in our results is proving the existence of code
families of sufficiently large size with good list-decoding properties for any
combination of $\delta,\gamma$ within the claimed feasibility region. We
achieve this via an intricate analysis of codes introduced by [Bukh, Ma; SIAM
J. Discrete Math; 2014]. Finally we give a simple yet powerful concatenation
scheme for list-decodable insertion-deletion codes which transforms any such
(non-efficient) code family (with information rate zero) into an efficiently
decodable code family with constant rate.

distances, rather than the usual Hamming distance. That is, a codemaker chooses
a hidden vector $\mathbf{y}\in\{-k,-k+1,\dots,k-1,k\}^n$ and answers to queries
of the form $\Vert\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{x}\Vert_p$ where
$\mathbf{x}\in\{-k,-k+1,\dots,k-1,k\}^n$. The goal is to minimize the number of
queries made in order to correctly guess $\mathbf{y}$.
</p>
<p>Motivated by this question, in this work, we develop a nonadaptive polynomial
time algorithm that works for a natural class of separable distance measures,
i.e.\ coordinate-wise sums of functions of the absolute value. This in
particular includes distances such as the smooth max (LogSumExp) as well as
many widely-studied $M$-estimator losses, such as $\ell_p$ norms, the
$\ell_1$-$\ell_2$ loss, the Huber loss, and the Fair estimator loss. When we
apply this result to $\ell_p$ queries, we obtain an upper bound of
$O\left(\min\left\{n,\frac{n\log k}{\log n}\right\}\right)$ queries for any
real $1\leq p&lt;\infty$. We also show matching lower bounds up to constant
factors for the $\ell_p$ problem, even for adaptive algorithms for the
approximation version of the problem, in which the problem is to output
$\mathbf{y}'$ such that $\Vert\mathbf{y}'-\mathbf{y}\Vert_p\leq R$ for any
$R\leq k^{1-\varepsilon}n^{1/p}$ for constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Thus,
essentially any approximation of this problem is as hard as finding the hidden
vector exactly, up to constant factors. Finally, we show that for the noisy
version of the problem, i.e. the setting when the codemaker answers queries
with any $q = (1\pm\varepsilon)\Vert\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{x}\Vert_p$, there is no
query efficient algorithm.

Each rule is specified by a
term, which is a conjunction of literals, and a value. Given an input, the
output of a decision list is the value corresponding to the first rule whole
term is satisfied by the input. Decision lists generalize both CNFs and DNFs,
and have been studied both in complexity theory and in learning theory.
</p>
<p>The size of a decision list is the number of rules, and its width is the
maximal number of variables in a term. We prove that decision lists of small
width can always be approximated by decision lists of small size, where we
obtain sharp bounds (up to constants). This in particular resolves a conjecture
of Gopalan, Meka and Reingold (Computational Complexity, 2013) on DNF
sparsification.
</p>
<p>An ingredient in our proof is a new random restriction lemma, which allows to
analyze how DNFs (and more generally, decision lists) simplify if a small
fraction of the variables are fixed. This is in contrast to the more commonly
used switching lemma, which requires most of the variables to be fixed.

be tested with a number of queries independent of the input size) is a
fundamental problem in the area of property testing. While there has been some
extensive prior research characterizing testable graph properties in the dense
graphs model and we have good understanding of the bounded degree graphs model,
no similar characterization has been known for general graphs, with no degree
bounds. In this paper we take on this major challenge and consider the problem
of characterizing all testable graph properties in general planar graphs.
</p>
<p>We consider the model in which a general planar graph can be accessed by the
random neighbor oracle that allows access to any given vertex and access to a
random neighbor of a given vertex. We show that, informally, a graph property
$P$ is testable with one-sided error for general planar graphs if and only if
testing $P$ can be reduced to testing for a finite family of finite forbidden
subgraphs. While our presentation focuses on planar graphs, our approach
extends easily to general minor-free graphs.
</p>
<p>Our analysis of the necessary condition relies on a recent construction of
canonical testers in the random neighbor oracle model that is applied here to
the one-sided error model for testing in planar graphs. The sufficient
condition in the characterization reduces the problem to the task of testing
$H$-freeness in planar graphs, and is the main and most challenging technical
contribution of the paper: we show that for planar graphs (with arbitrary
degrees), the property of being $H$-free is testable with one-sided error for
every finite graph $H$, in the random neighbor oracle model.

streaming model of computation, called the sliding window model. In this model,
we are given a size of the sliding window $n$ and a stream of symbols. At each
time instant, we must decide whether the suffix of length $n$ of the current
stream ("the active window") belongs to a given regular language.
</p>
<p>Recent works showed that the space complexity of an optimal deterministic
sliding window algorithm for this problem is either constant, logarithmic or
linear in the window size $n$ and provided natural language theoretic
characterizations of the space complexity classes. Subsequently, those results
were extended to randomized algorithms to show that any such algorithm admits
either constant, double logarithmic, logarithmic or linear space complexity.
</p>
<p>In this work, we make an important step forward and combine the sliding
window model with the property testing setting, which results in
ultra-efficient algorithms for all regular languages. Informally, a sliding
window property tester must accept the active window if it belongs to the
language and reject it if it is far from the language. We consider
deterministic and randomized sliding window property testers with one-sided and
two-sided errors. In particular, we show that for any regular language, there
is a deterministic sliding window property tester that uses logarithmic space
and a randomized sliding window property tester with two-sided error that uses
constant space.

Comparator circuits are a natural circuit model for studying the concept of bounded fan-out computations, which intuitively corresponds to whether or not a computational model can make "copies" of intermediate computational steps. Comparator circuits are believed to be weaker than general Boolean circuits, but they can simulate Branching Programs and Boolean formulas. In this paper we prove the first superlinear lower bounds in the general (non-monotone) version of this model for an explicitly defined function. More precisely, we prove that the $n$-bit Element Distinctness function requires $\Omega( (n/ \log n)^{3/2})$ size comparator circuits.</div>

<p><em>[The following is a guest post by Benny Applebaum announcing a new conference on information theoretic cryptography – an area with both beautiful math and important applications. –Boaz] </em></p>



<p>Deal friends,<br />We are happy to announce the birth of a new conference on Information-Theoretic Cryptography (ITC). Information-theoretic cryptography studies security in the presence of computationally unbounded adversaries and covers a wide array of topics at the intersection of cryptography, coding theory, information-theory and theory of computation. Notable examples include randomness extraction and privacy amplification, secret sharing, secure multiparty computation and proof systems, private-information retrieval and locally decodable codes, authentication codes and non-malleable codes, differential privacy, quantum information processing, and information-theoretic foundations of physical-layer security. See <a href="https://itcrypto.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://itcrypto.github.io</a> for more information. </p>



<p>ITC replaces the International Conference on Information Theoretic Security (ICITS), which was dedicated to the same topic and ran 2005-2017. ITC can be seen as a reboot of ICITS with a new name, a new steering committee and a renewed excitement.  (beware: there is  a fake website for ICITS 2019 created by a known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Academy_of_Science,_Engineering_and_Technology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fraudulent organization</a>)  </p>



<p>The conference will have two tracks: a conference track and  a “greatest hits” track. The conference track will operate like a traditional conference with the usual review process and published proceedings. The “greatest hits” track consists of invited talks (not included in the proceedings) that highlight the most exciting recent advances in the area. We solicit nominations for “greatest hits” talks from the community.</p>



<p>The first ITC conference will take place in Boston, MA on June 17-19, 2020 (just before STOC).  The submission deadline for ITC 2020 is Dec 16, 2019 and the call for papers (including a nomination procedure for the greatest hits track) is available here:  <a href="https://itcrypto.github.io/2020.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://itcrypto.github.io/2020.html</a></p>



<p>Please submit your best work to ITC 2020! We hope to see many of you there!</p>



<p>best regards,The Steering Committee:  Benny Applebaum (Chair), Ivan Damgård , Yevgeniy Dodis,  Yuval Ishai, Ueli Maurer,  Kobbi Nissim, Krzysztof Pietrzak, Manoj Prabhakaran, Adam Smith, Yael Tauman Kalai, Stefano Tessaro, Vinod Vaikuntanathan, Hoeteck Wee, Daniel Wichs, Mary Wootters,  Chaoping Xing, Moti Yung

<p>You’ve seen the stories—in the <em>Financial Times</em>, <em>Technology Review</em>, <em>CNET</em>, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, or elsewhere—saying that a group at Google has now achieved quantum computational supremacy with a 53-qubit superconducting device.  While these stories are easy to find, I’m not going to link to them here, for the simple reason that <em>none of them were supposed to exist yet</em>.</p>



<p>As the world now knows, Google is indeed preparing a big announcement about quantum supremacy, to coincide with the publication of its research paper in a high-profile journal (which journal?  you can probably narrow it down to two).  This will hopefully happen within a month.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, though, NASA, which has some contributors to the work, inadvertently posted an outdated version of the Google paper on a public website.  It was there only briefly, but long enough to make it to the <em>Financial Times</em>, my inbox, and millions of other places.  Fact-free pontificating about what it means has predictably proliferated.</p>



<p>The world, it seems, is going to be denied its clean “moon landing” moment, wherein the Extended Church-Turing Thesis gets experimentally obliterated within the space of a press conference.  This is going to be more like the Wright Brothers’ flight—about which rumors and half-truths leaked out in dribs and drabs between 1903 and 1908, the year Will and Orville finally agreed to do public demonstration flights.  (This time around, though, it thankfully won’t take <em>that</em> long to clear everything up!)</p>



<p>I’ve known about what was in the works for a couple months now; it was excruciating not being able to blog about it.  Though sworn to secrecy, I couldn’t resist dropping some hints here and there (did you catch any?)—for example, in my recent <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4301">Bernays Lectures</a> in Zürich, a lecture series whose entire structure built up to the brink of this moment.</p>



<p>This post is not an official announcement or confirmation of anything.  Though the lightning may already be visible, the thunder belongs to the group at Google, at a time and place of its choosing.</p>



<p>Rather, because so much misinformation is swirling around, what I thought I’d do here, in my role as blogger and “public intellectual,” is offer <strong>Scott’s Supreme Quantum Supremacy FAQ</strong>.  You know, just in case you were randomly curious about the topic of quantum supremacy, or wanted to know what the implications would be if some search engine company based in Mountain View or wherever were <em>hypothetically</em> to claim to have achieved quantum supremacy.</p>



<p>Without further ado, then:</p>



<p><strong>Q1. What is quantum computational supremacy?</strong></p>



<p>Often abbreviated to just “quantum supremacy,” the term refers to the use of a quantum computer to solve <em>some</em> well-defined set of problems that would take orders of magnitude longer to solve with any currently known algorithms running on existing classical computers—and not for incidental reasons, but for reasons of asymptotic quantum complexity.  The emphasis here is on being as sure as possible that the problem <em>really was</em> solved quantumly and <em>really is</em> classically intractable, and ideally achieving the speedup <em>soon</em> (with the noisy, non-universal QCs of the present or very near future).  If the problem is also <em>useful</em> for something, then so much the better, but that’s not at all necessary.  The Wright Flyer and the Fermi pile weren’t useful in themselves.</p>



<p><strong>Q2. If Google has indeed achieved quantum supremacy, does that mean that now <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1175200727385464832">“no code is uncrackable”</a>, as Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang recently tweeted?</strong></p>



<p>No, it doesn’t.  (But I still like Yang’s candidacy.)</p>



<p>There are two issues here.  First, the devices currently being built by Google, IBM, and others have 50-100 qubits and no error-correction.  Running Shor’s algorithm to break the RSA cryptosystem would require several thousand logical qubits.  With known error-correction methods, that could easily translate into <em>millions</em> of physical qubits, and those probably of a higher quality than any that exist today.  I don’t think anyone is close to that, and we have no idea how long it will take.</p>



<p>But the second issue is that, even in a hypothetical future with scalable, error-corrected QCs, on our current understanding they’ll only be able to crack <em>some</em> codes, not all of them.  By an unfortunate coincidence, the public-key codes that they can crack include <em>most</em> of what we currently use to secure the Internet: RSA, Diffie-Hellman, elliptic curve crypto, etc.  But symmetric-key crypto should only be minimally affected.  And there are even candidates for public-key cryptosystems (for example, based on lattices) that no one knows how to break quantumly after 20+ years of trying, and some efforts underway now to start migrating to those systems.  For more, see for example my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3848">letter to Rebecca Goldstein</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Q3. What calculation is Google planning to do, or has it already done, that’s believed to be classically hard?</strong></p>



<p>So, I can tell you, but I’ll feel slightly sheepish doing so.  The calculation is: a “challenger” generates a random quantum circuit C (i.e., a random sequence of 1-qubit and nearest-neighbor 2-qubit gates, of depth perhaps 20, acting on a 2D grid of n = 50 to 60 qubits).  The challenger then sends C to the quantum computer, and asks it apply C to the all-0 initial state, measure the result in the {0,1} basis, send back whatever n-bit string was observed, and repeat some thousands or millions of times.  Finally, using its knowledge of C, the classical challenger applies a statistical test to check whether the outputs are consistent with the QC having done this.</p>



<p>So, this is not a problem like factoring with a single right answer.  The circuit C gives rise to some probability distribution, call it D<sub>C</sub>, over n-bit strings, and the problem is to output samples from that distribution.  In fact, there will typically be 2<sup>n</sup> strings in the support of D<sub>C</sub>—so many that, if the QC is working as expected, the same output will never be observed twice.  A crucial point, though, is that the distribution D<sub>C</sub> is <em>not</em> uniform.  Some strings enjoy constructive interference of amplitudes and therefore have larger probabilities, while others suffer destructive interference and have smaller probabilities.  And even though we’ll only see a number of samples that’s tiny compared to 2<sup>n</sup>, we can <em>check</em> whether the samples preferentially cluster among the strings that are predicted to be likelier, and thereby build up our confidence that something classically intractable is being done.</p>



<p>So, tl;dr, the quantum computer is simply asked to apply a random (but known) sequence of quantum operations—not because we intrinsically care about the result, but because we’re trying to prove that it can beat a classical computer at <em>some</em> well-defined task.</p>



<p><strong>Q4. But if the quantum computer is just executing some random garbage circuit, whose only purpose is to be hard to simulate classically, then who cares?  Isn’t this a big overhyped nothingburger?</strong></p>



<p>No.  As I put it the other day, it’s not an everythingburger, but it’s certainly at least a somethingburger!</p>



<p>It’s like, have a little respect for the immensity of what we’re talking about here, and for the terrifying engineering that’s needed to make it reality.  Before quantum supremacy, by definition, the QC skeptics can all laugh to each other that, for all the billions of dollars spent over 20+ years, <em>still</em> no quantum computer has even once been used to solve any problem faster than your laptop could solve it, or at least not in any way that depended on its being a quantum computer.  In a post-quantum-supremacy world, that’s no longer the case.  A superposition involving 2<sup>50</sup> or 2<sup>60</sup> complex numbers has been computationally harnessed, using time and space resources that are minuscule compared to 2<sup>50</sup> or 2<sup>60</sup>.</p>



<p>I keep bringing up the Wright Flyer only because the chasm between what we’re talking about, and the dismissiveness I’m seeing in some corners of the Internet, is kind of breathtaking to me.  It’s like, if you believed that useful air travel was fundamentally impossible, then seeing a dinky wooden propeller plane keep itself aloft wouldn’t refute your belief … <em>but it sure as hell shouldn’t reassure you either</em>.</p>



<p>Was I right to <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/scott-aaronson-answers-every-ridiculously-big-question-i-throw-at-him/">worry</a>, years ago, that the constant drumbeat of hype about much less significant QC milestones would wear out people’s patience, so that they’d no longer care when something newsworthy finally did happen?</p>



<p><strong>Q5. Years ago, you scolded the masses for being super-excited about D-Wave, and its claims to get huge quantum speedups for optimization problems via quantum annealing.  Today you scold the masses for <em>not</em> being super-excited about quantum supremacy.  Why can’t you stay consistent?</strong></p>



<p>Because my goal is not to move the “excitement level” in some uniformly preferred direction, it’s to be right!  With hindsight, would you say that I was mostly right about D-Wave, even when raining on that particular parade made me unpopular in some circles?  Well, I’m trying to be right about quantum supremacy too.</p>



<p><strong>Q6. If quantum supremacy calculations just involve sampling from probability distributions, how do you check that they were done correctly?</strong></p>



<p>Glad you asked!  This is the subject of a fair amount of theory that I and others developed over the last decade.  I already gave you the short version in my answer to Q3: you check by doing statistics on the samples that the QC returned, to verify that they’re preferentially clustered in the “peaks” of the chaotic probability distribution D<sub>C</sub>.  One convenient way of doing this, which Google calls the “linear cross-entropy test,” is simply to sum up Pr[C outputs s<sub>i</sub>] over all the samples s<sub>1</sub>,…,s<sub>k</sub> that the QC returned, and then to declare the test a “success” if and only if the sum exceeds some threshold—say, bk/2<sup>n</sup>, for some constant b strictly between 1 and 2.</p>



<p>Admittedly, in order to apply this test, you need to <em>calculate</em> the probabilities Pr[C outputs s<sub>i</sub>] on your classical computer—and the only known ways to calculate them require brute force and take ~2<sup>n</sup> time.  Is that a showstopper?  No, not if n is 50, and you’re Google and are able to handle numbers like 2<sup>50</sup> (although not 2<sup>1000</sup>, which exceeds a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googol">googol</a>, har har).  By running a huge cluster of classical cores for (say) a month, you can eventually verify the outputs that your QC produced in a few seconds—while also seeing that the QC was many orders of magnitude faster.  However, this does mean that sampling-based quantum supremacy experiments are almost <em>specifically</em> designed for ~50-qubit devices like the ones being built right now.  Even with 100 qubits, we wouldn’t know how to verify the results using all the classical computing power available on earth.</p>



<p>(Let me stress that this issue is specific to <em>sampling</em> experiments like the ones that are currently being done.  If Shor’s algorithm factored a 2000-digit number, it would be easy to check the result by simply multiplying the claimed factors and running a primality test on them.  Likewise, if a QC were used to simulate some complicated biomolecule, you could check its results by comparing them to experiment.)</p>



<p><strong>Q7. Wait.  If classical computers can only check the results of a quantum supremacy experiment, in a regime where the classical computers can still simulate the experiment (albeit extremely slowly), then how do you get to claim “quantum supremacy”?</strong></p>



<p>Come on.  With a 53-qubit chip, it’s perfectly feasible to see a speedup by a factor of many millions, in a regime where you can still directly verify the outputs, and also to see that the speedup is growing exponentially with the number of qubits, exactly as asymptotic analysis would predict.  This isn’t marginal.</p>



<p><strong>Q8. Is there a mathematical proof that no fast classical algorithm could possibly spoof the results of a sampling-based quantum supremacy experiment?</strong></p>



<p>Not at present.  But that’s not quantum supremacy researchers’ fault!  As long as theoretical computer scientists can’t even prove basic conjectures like P≠NP or P≠PSPACE, there’s no hope of ruling out a fast classical simulation unconditionally.  The best we can hope for are conditional hardness results.  And we have indeed managed to prove some such results—see for example the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.3245">BosonSampling paper</a>, or the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04402">Bouland et al. paper</a> on average-case #P-hardness of calculating amplitudes in random circuits, or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05903">my paper with Lijie Chen</a> (“Complexity-Theoretic Foundations of Quantum Supremacy Experiments”).  The biggest theoretical open problem in this area, in my opinion, is to prove <em>better</em> conditional hardness results.</p>



<p><strong>Q9. Does sampling-based quantum supremacy have any applications in itself?</strong></p>



<p>When people were first thinking about this subject, it seemed pretty obvious that the answer was “no”!  (I know because I was one of the people.)  Recently, however, the situation has changed—for example, because of my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/certrand2.ppt">certified randomness protocol</a>, which shows how a sampling-based quantum supremacy experiment could almost immediately be repurposed to generate bits that can be <em>proven to be random</em> to a skeptical third party (under computational assumptions).  This, in turn, has possible applications to proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies and other cryptographic protocols.  I’m hopeful that more such applications will be discovered in the near future.</p>



<p><strong>Q10. If the quantum supremacy experiments are just generating random bits, isn’t that uninteresting?  Isn’t it trivial to convert qubits into random bits, just by measuring them?</strong></p>



<p>The key is that a quantum supremacy experiment doesn’t generate <em>uniform</em> random bits.  Instead, it samples from some complicated, correlated probability distribution over 50- or 60-bit strings.  In my certified randomness protocol, the deviations from uniformity play a central role in how the QC convinces a classical skeptic that it really <em>was</em> sampling the bits randomly, rather than in some secretly deterministic way (e.g., using a pseudorandom generator).</p>



<p><strong>Q11. Haven’t decades of quantum-mechanical experiments–for example, the ones that violated the Bell inequality–already demonstrated quantum supremacy?</strong></p>



<p>This is purely a confusion over words.  Those other experiments demonstrated other forms of “quantum supremacy”: for example, in the case of Bell inequality violations, what you could call “quantum correlational supremacy.”  They did not demonstrate quantum <em>computational</em> supremacy, meaning doing something that’s infeasible to simulate using a classical computer (where the classical simulation has no restrictions of spatial locality or anything else of that kind).  Today, when people use the phrase “quantum supremacy,” it’s generally short for quantum computational supremacy.  </p>



<p><strong>Q12. Even so, there are countless examples of materials and chemical reactions that are hard to classically simulate, as well as special-purpose quantum simulators (like those of Lukin’s group at Harvard).  Why don’t these already count as quantum computational supremacy?</strong></p>



<p>Under some people’s definitions of “quantum computational supremacy,” they do!  The key difference with Google’s effort is that they have a <em>fully programmable </em>device—one that you can program with an arbitrary sequence of nearest-neighbor 2-qubit gates, just by sending the appropriate signals from your classical computer.</p>



<p>In other words, it’s no longer open to the QC skeptics to sneer that, sure, there are quantum systems that are hard to simulate classically, but that’s just because <em>nature</em> is hard to simulate, and you don’t get to arbitrarily redefine whatever random chemical you find in the wild to be a “computer for simulating itself.”  Under any sane definition, the superconducting devices that Google, IBM, and others are now building are indeed “computers.”</p>



<p><strong>Q13. Did you (Scott Aaronson) invent the concept of quantum supremacy?</strong></p>



<p>No.  I did play some role in developing it, which led to Sabine Hossenfelder among others <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2019/06/quantum-supremacy-what-is-it-and-what.html">generously overcrediting me</a> for the whole idea.  The term “quantum supremacy” was coined by John Preskill in 2012, though in some sense the core concept goes back to the beginnings of quantum computing itself in the early 1980s.  In 1994, the use of Shor’s algorithm to factor a huge number became the quantum supremacy experiment <em>par excellence</em>—albeit, one that’s still (in 2019) much too hard to perform.</p>



<p>The key idea of instead demonstrating quantum supremacy using a <em>sampling problem</em> was, as far as I know, first suggested by Barbara Terhal and David DiVincenzo, in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205133">farsighted paper</a> from 2002.  The “modern” push for sampling-based supremacy experiments started around 2011, when Alex Arkhipov and I published our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.3245">paper on BosonSampling</a>, and (independently of us) Bremner, Jozsa, and Shepherd published their <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1407">paper on the commuting Hamiltonians model</a>.  These papers showed, not only that “simple,” non-universal quantum systems can solve apparently-hard sampling problems, but also that an efficient classical algorithm for the same sampling problems would imply a collapse of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_hierarchy">polynomial hierarchy</a>.  Arkhipov and I also made a start toward arguing that even the <em>approximate</em> versions of quantum sampling problems can be classically hard.</p>



<p>As far as I know, the idea of “Random Circuit Sampling”—that is, generating your hard sampling problem by just picking a random sequence of 2-qubit gates in (say) a superconducting architecture—originated in an email thread that I started in December 2015, which also included John Martinis, Hartmut Neven, Sergio Boixo, Ashley Montanaro, Michael Bremner, Richard Jozsa, Aram Harrow, Greg Kuperberg, and others.  The thread was entitled “Hard sampling problems with 40 qubits,” and my email began “Sorry for the spam.”  I then discussed some advantages and disadvantages of three options for demonstrating sampling-based quantum supremacy: (1) random circuits, (2) commuting Hamiltonians, and (3) BosonSampling.  After Greg Kuperberg chimed in to support option (1), a consensus quickly formed among the participants that (1) was indeed the best option from an engineering standpoint—and that, if the theoretical analysis wasn’t yet satisfactory for (1), then that was something we could remedy.</p>



<p>[<strong>Update:</strong> Sergio Boixo tells me that, internally, the Google group had been considering the idea of random circuit sampling since February 2015, even before my email thread.  This doesn’t surprise me: while there are lots of details that had to be worked out, the idea itself is an extremely natural one.]</p>



<p>After that, the Google group did a huge amount of analysis of random circuit sampling, both theoretical and numerical, while <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05903">Lijie Chen and I</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04402">Bouland et al.</a> supplied different forms of complexity-theoretic evidence for the problem’s classical hardness.</p>



<p><strong>Q14. If quantum supremacy was achieved, what would it mean for the QC skeptics?</strong></p>



<p>I wouldn’t want to be them right now!  They could retreat to the position that <em>of course</em> quantum supremacy is possible (who ever claimed that it wasn’t? surely not them!), that the real issue has always been quantum error-correction.  And indeed, some of them have consistently maintained that position all along.  But others, including my good friend Gil Kalai, are <strong>on record, right here on this blog</strong> predicting that even quantum supremacy can never be achieved for fundamental reasons.  I won’t let them wiggle out of it now.</p>



<p>[<strong>Update:</strong> As many of you will have seen, Gil Kalai has <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/23/quantum-computers-amazing-progress-google-ibm-and-extraordinary-but-probably-false-supremacy-claims-google/">taken the position</a> that the Google result won’t stand and will need to be retracted.  He asked for more data: specifically, a complete histogram of the output probabilities for a smaller number of qubits.  This turns out to be already available, in a <em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06678">Science</a></em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06678"> paper from 2018</a>.]</p>



<p><strong>Q15. What’s next?</strong></p>



<p><em>If</em> it’s achieved quantum supremacy, then I think the Google group already has the requisite hardware to demonstrate my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/certrand2.ppt">protocol for generating certified random bits</a>.  And that’s indeed one of the very next things they’re planning to do.</p>



<p>[<strong>Addendum:</strong> Also, of course, the evidence for quantum supremacy itself can be made stronger and various loopholes closed—for example, by improving the fidelity so that fewer samples need to be taken (something that Umesh Vazirani tells me he’d like to see), by having the circuit C be generated and the outputs verified by a skeptic external to Google. and simply by letting more time pass, so outsiders can have a crack at simulating the results classically.  My personal guess is that the basic picture is going to stand, but just like with the first experiments that claimed to violate the Bell inequality, there’s still plenty of room to force the skeptics into a tinier corner.]</p>



<p>Beyond that, one obvious next milestone would be to use a programmable QC, with (say) 50-100 qubits, to do some <em>useful quantum simulation</em> (say, of a condensed-matter system) much faster than any known classical method could do it.  A second obvious milestone would be to demonstrate the use of quantum error-correction, to keep an encoded qubit alive for longer than the underlying physical qubits remain alive.  There’s no doubt that Google, IBM, and the other players will now be racing toward both of these milestones.</p>



<p>[<strong>Update:</strong> Steve Girvin reminds me that the Yale group <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04768">has already achieved</a> quantum error-correction “beyond the break-even point,” albeit in a bosonic system rather than superconducting qubits.  So perhaps a better way to phrase the next milestone would be: achieve quantum computational supremacy <em>and</em> useful quantum error-correction in one and the same system.]</p></div>

Sitting around with three faculty we had the following conversation<br />
<br />
ALICE: When I applied to grad school in 1980 they saw a strong math major (that is, I had good grades in hard math courses) but very little programming or any sort of computer science. That kind of person would NOT be admitted today since there are plenty of strong math majors who ALSO have the Comp Sci chops.<br />
<br />
BOB: When I applied to grad school I was a comp sci major but my grades were not that good- A's in system courses, B's and even some C's in math. But I did a Security project that lead to a paper that got into a (minor) systems workshop. Two of my letters bragged a lot about that. (How do I know that? Don't ask.) So I got into grad school in 1989.  That kind of person would NOT be admitted today since there are plenty of people who have papers in minor conferences whose grades ARE good in stuff other than their area.<br />
<br />
CAROL: In 1975 I was an English major at Harvard. The summer between my junior and senior year I took a programming course over the summer and did very well and liked it. I then took some math.  Then I worked in industry at a computer scientist for 5 years. Then I applied to grad school and they liked my unusual background. Plus I did well on the GRE's. Letters from my boss at work helped me, I don't think they would count letters from industry now. They took a chance on me, and it paid off (I got a PhD) but I don't think they would let someone like me in now since they don't have to take a chance. They can admit people who have done research, have solid backgrounds, and hence are not taking a chance. The irony is that some of those don't finish anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Are Alice, Bob, and Carol right that they wouldn't be admitted to grad school now?  I think they are with a caveat- they might end up in a lower tier grad school then they did end up in. Also, Alice and Bob I am more certain would not end up in the top tier grad schools they did since they can be compared DIRECTLY to other applicants,<br />
where as Carol might be more orthogonal.<br />
<br />
2) I have a sense (backed up my no data) that we are accepting fewer unusual cases than we used to (not just UMCP but across the country) because too many of the applicants are the standard very-good-on-paper applicants. Even the on-paper is not quite fair- they ARE very good for real.<br />
<br />
3) Assume we are taking less unusual cases. Is that bad? I think so as people with different backgrounds (Carol especially) add to the diversity of trains of thought in a program, and that is surely a good thing.  If EVERY students is a strong comp sci major who has done some research, there is a blandness to that.<br />
<br />
4) What to do about this? First off, determine if this is really a problem. If it is then perhaps when looking at grad school applicants have some sensitivity to this issue.<br />
<br />
5) For grad school admissions I am speculating. For REU admissions (I have run an REU program for the last 7 years and do all of the admissions myself) I can speak with more experience. The students who apply have gotten better over time and this IS cause for celebration; however, it has made taking unusual cases harder. <br />

<div>A new conference on Information-Theoretic Cryptography is starting next year. It is about topics that I have always been fond of, a former student of mine is in the steering committee, and an academic grandchild of mine is in the program committee of the inaugural conference, so I am very happy to pass along the following announcement from Benny Applebaum.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<hr />
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Dear friends,</div>
<div></div>
<div>We are happy to announce the birth of a new conference on <span class="il">Information</span>-Theoretic Cryptography (ITC). <span class="il">Information</span>-theoretic cryptography studies security in the presence of computationally unbounded adversaries and covers a wide array of topics at the intersection of cryptography, coding theory, <span class="il">information</span>-theory and theory of computation. Notable examples include randomness extraction and privacy amplification, secret sharing, secure multiparty computation and proof systems, private-<span class="il">information</span> retrieval and locally decodable codes, authentication codes and non-malleable codes, differential privacy, quantum <span class="il">information</span> processing, and <span class="il">information</span>-theoretic foundations of physical-layer security. See <a href="https://itcrypto.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://itcrypto.github.io</a> for more <span class="il">information</span>.</div>
<p>ITC replaces the International Conference on <span class="il">Information</span> Theoretic Security (ICITS), which was dedicated to the same topic and ran 2005-2017. ITC can be seen as a reboot of ICITS with a new name, a new steering committee and a renewed excitement.  (beware: there is  a fake website for ICITS 2019 created by a known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Academy_of_Science,_Engineering_and_Technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fraudulent organization</a>)</p>
<div></div>
<div>The conference will have two tracks: a conference track and  a “greatest hits” track. The conference track will operate like a traditional conference with the usual review process and published proceedings. The “greatest hits” track consists of invited talks (not included in the proceedings) that highlight the most exciting recent advances in the area. We solicit nominations for “greatest hits” talks from the community.<p></p>
<p>The first ITC conference will take place in Boston, MA on June 17-19, 2020 (just before STOC).  The submission deadline for ITC 2020 is Dec 16, 2019 and the call for papers (including a nomination procedure for the greatest hits track) is available here:  <a href="https://itcrypto.github.io/2020.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://itcrypto.github.io/2020.html</a></p>
<p>Please submit your best work to ITC 2020! We hope to see many of you there!</p>
</div>
<div>best regards,</div>
<div>The Steering Committee:  Benny Applebaum (Chair), Ivan Damgård , Yevgeniy Dodis,  Yuval Ishai, Ueli Maurer,  Kobbi Nissim, Krzysztof Pietrzak, Manoj Prabhakaran, Adam Smith, Yael Tauman Kalai, Stefano Tessaro, Vinod Vaikuntanathan, Hoeteck Wee, Daniel Wichs, Mary Wootters,  Chaoping Xing, Moti Yung</div></div>

<h3>Recent quantum computer news</h3>
<p>You already heard by now that Google (informally) announced it achieved the milestone of “quantum supremacy” on a 53 qubit quantum computer. IBM announced launching in October a quantum computer also on 53 of qubits.  Google’s claim of quantum supremacy is given in two papers from August that were accidentally leaked to the public. Here are links to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19lv8p1fB47z1pEZVlfDXhop082Lc-kdD/view">short main paper</a> and to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-7_CzhOF7wruqU_TKltM2f8haZ_R3aNb/view">long supplementary paper</a>. The paper correctly characterizes achieving quantum supremacy as an achievement of the highest caliber.</p>
<p>Putting 50+ qubits together and allowing good quality quantum gates to operate on them is a big deal. So, in my view, Google and IBM’s  noisy quantum circuits represent a remarkable achievement. Of course, the big question is if they can do some interesting computation reliably, but bringing us to the place that this can be tested at all is, in my view, a big deal!</p>
<p>Of course, demonstrating quantum supremacy is even a much bigger deal, but I expect that Google’s claim <strong>will not stand</strong>. As you know, I expect that quantum supremacy cannot be achieved at all. (See <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/08/21/the-argument-against-quantum-computers-a-cern-colloquium-and-a-new-paper/">this post</a>, this <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/main-pr.pdf">paper A</a>, this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02499">paper B</a>, and <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/cern.pptx">these slides of my recent lecture at CERN</a>.)  My specific concerns expressed in this post are, of course, related to my overall skeptic stance as well as to some technical points that I made in my papers, but they could (and should) have also been made by responsible quantum computer believers.</p>
<h3>Achieving quantum supremacy via sampling</h3>
<p>In the last decade there were several suggestions to demonstrate the computational superior power of quantum circuits via sampling tasks. The computer creates (approximately) a probability distribution <strong>D</strong> on 0-1 strings of length n (or other combinatorial objects) that we have good computational complexity reasons to think that classical computers cannot achieve. In our case, <strong>D</strong> is the probability distribution obtained by measuring the outcome of a fixed pseudo-random quantum circuit.</p>
<p>By creating a 0-1 distribution we mean sampling sufficiently many times from that distribution <strong>D</strong> so it allows us to show that the sampled distribution is close enough to <strong>D</strong>. Because of the imperfection (noise) of qubits and gates (and perhaps some additional sources of noise) we actually do not sample from <strong>D</strong> but from another distribution <strong>D’</strong>. However if <strong>D’</strong> is close enough to <strong>D</strong>, the conclusion that classical computers cannot efficiently sample according to <strong>D’</strong> is plausible.</p>
<h3>How to run supremacy sampling experiment</h3>
<p>You compare the distribution <strong>E</strong> obtained by the experiment to the ideal distribution <strong>D </strong>for increasingly larger values of n. If there  is a good match this supports your supremacy claims.</p>
<p>There are two important caveats:</p>
<ol>
<li>A single run of the quantum computer gives you only one sample from <strong>D’ </strong>so to get a meaningful description of the target distribution you need to have many samples.</li>
<li>Computing the ideal distribution <strong>D</strong> is computationally hard so as <em>n</em> increases you need a bigger and bigger computational effort to compute <strong>D</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Still, if you can show that <strong>D’</strong> is close enough to <strong>D</strong> before you reach the supremacy regime, and you can carry out the sampling in the supremacy regime then this gives you good reason to think that your experiments in the supremacy regime demonstrate “quantum supremacy”.</p>
<h3>Earlier experiments</h3>
<p>The Google group itself ran this experiment for 9 qubits <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06678">in 2017</a>. One concern I have with this experiment is that I did not see quantitative data indicating how close <strong>D’</strong> is to <strong>D</strong>. Those are distributions on 512 strings that can be described very accurately.  (There were also some boson sampling experiments with 6 bosons and 2 modes and 5 bosons with 5 modes. In this case, supremacy requires something like 50 bosons with 100 modes.)</p>
<h3>The twist in Google’s approach</h3>
<p>The twist in Google’s approach is that they try to compute <strong>D’</strong> based mainly on the 1-qubit and 2-qubit (and readout errors) errors and then run an experiment on 53 qubits where they can neither compute <strong>D</strong> nor verify that they sample from <strong>D’</strong>. In fact they sample <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E7&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="10^7" class="latex" title="10^7" /> samples from 0-1 strings of length 53 so this is probably much too sparse to distinguish between <strong>D</strong> and the uniform distribution even if we have unlimited computational power. (Actually as several people mentioned the last sentence is incorrect.)</p>
<h3>The missing part in the experiment.</h3>
<p>The obvious missing part in the experiment is to run the experiment on random circuits with 9-25 qubits and to test the research assumption about <strong>D’</strong>. I find it a bit surprising that apparently this was not carried out. What is needed is experiments to understand probability distributions obtained by  pseudorandom circuits on 9-, 15-, 20-, 25- qubits. How close they are to the ideal distribution D and how robust they are (namely, what is the gap between experimental distributions for two samples obtained by two runs of the experiment.)</p>
<p>Actually, as I noted in the introduction to <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/main-pr.pdf">Paper A</a> (subsection on near term plans for “quantum supremacy” and  Figure 3), you can bring the hypothesis of quantum supremacy via pseudo-random circuits into test already in the 10-30 qubit regime without even building 53- or 72- qubit devices. (I can certainly see the importance in building larger circuits that are necessary for good quality error correcting codes.)</p>
<h3>The main potential mistake and the matter of correlation.</h3>
<p>Let me also indicate what is a potential mistake in the computation of <strong>D’ </strong>relying just on the behavior of qubits and gates. This is related to correlated (2-qubit gate) errors that I studied mainly before 2014.</p>
<p>The general picture regarding correlated qubit errors is the following:</p>
<p>(1) Errors for gated qubits (for a CNOT gate) are (substantially) positively correlated.</p>
<p>Here, you can think about the extreme form of “bad” noise where with a small probability t  both gated qubits are corrupted and with probability (1-t) nothing happens. (“Good” noise is when each qubit is corrupted with probability t, independently. Real life 2-qubit noise is a certain mixture of good and bad noise.)</p>
<p>(2) Therefore, (unless you are below the threshold level and apply quantum fault tolerance scheme) qubits in cat states that were created indirectly will have correlated noise of this kind.</p>
<p>(3) Therefore (and going from (2) to (3) is a mathematical part) probability distributions described by pseudorandom circuits will have a strong effect of synchronized errors.</p>
<p>What is most devastating about correlated errors is that the accumulated error-rate in terms of qubit errors becomes quadratic in the number of rounds instead of linear. See Remark 4.2 about “model error-rate” and “effective error-rate” in <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/main-pr.pdf">Paper A</a>.</p>
<h3>My predictions.</h3>
<p>Let me mention that Paper B describes fairly detailed predictions about  probability distributions obtained by  pseudo-random circuits and these predictions can be tested in the 9-25 qubits range. In particular, they suggest that robust outcomes will be easy to simulate classically, as they belong to a very low level (<strong>LDP</strong>) computational complexity class,  and that noise sensitivity will lead to chaotic outcomes which are far from the ideal distribution.</p>
<h3>A problem with the supremacy statements itself.</h3>
<blockquote><p>On Google Cloud servers, we estimate that performing the same task for m = 20 with 0.1% fidelity using the SFA algorithm would cost 50 trillion core-hours and consume 1 petawatt hour of energy. To put this in perspective, it took 600 seconds to sample the circuit on the quantum processor 3 million times, where sampling time is limited by control hardware communications; in fact, the net quantum processor time is only about 30 seconds.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is not clear where these fantastic numbers come from. They  refer to a specific algorithm and there might be some vague reason to think that this algorithm cannot be improved for D or near by distributions. But, for example,  for the probability distribution I predict this algorithm is extremely inefficient and the sampling can be carried out efficiently.</p>
<h3>Distance-3 surface code</h3>
<p>In 2013 I was one of the organizers of a conference <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2013/04/12/qstart/">Qstart</a> celebrating our then new Quantum Science Center. John Martinis gave a lecture where he mentioned building distance-3 surface codes on 20+ qubits as a (then) near term task. My argument against quantum computers does not give a definite prediction whether  distance-3 surface codes are within or beyond reach and it would be interesting to examine it.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>It looks that Martinis’ groups announcement of supremacy, while based on a remarkable experimental progress,  was premature and in my view it is mistaken. (To be fair, the papers themselves were prematurely released.) This post was also written rather quickly so I will certainly have to think about matters further, perhaps also in view of more careful reading of the papers, some comments by members of the Google group themselves and other people, and also Scott Aaronson promised to write about it.</p>
