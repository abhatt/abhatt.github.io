<p>Apologies dear readers for the late posting. The beginning of the school year is always frenzied, and the pandemic has only added to that frenzy. We have an exciting September, with four papers on graph property testing, one paper on distribution testing, and one paper that connects both topics.</p>



<p><strong>Estimation of Graph Isomorphism Distance in the Query World</strong> by Sourav Chakraborty, Arijit Ghosh, Gopinath Mishra, and Sayantan Sen (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/135/">ECCC</a>). Graph isomorphism is about as fundamental as it gets, and this papers studies approximating the graph isomorphism distance for dense graphs. There is a known graph \(G_k\) (with \(n\) vertices). The algorithm is given query access to an input graph \(G_u\) and needs to approximate the number of edge inserts/deletes required to make the graphs isomorphic. This is the tolerant testing version; the property testing version is known to be doable in \(\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})\) queries (<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/070680795?journalCode=smjcat">Matsliah-Fischer</a>). The main insight of this paper is to relate the tolerant testing complexity to a distribution testing problem. Consider distributions over the \(\{0,1\}^n\) defined by multisets of \(n\) hypercube points. Our aim is to estimate the earthmover distance between a known distribution and an unknown distribution. Interestingly, the query model is different: one can sample the underlying multisets <em>without</em> replacement. It turns out that the optimal complexity of this problem is (upto polylog factors) is the same as the optimal complexity of tolerant testing of graph isomorphism. A direct corollary is that the isomorphism distance can be approximated upto additive \(\epsilon n^2\) using \(\widetilde{O}(n)\) samples. This equivalence also gives an alternate proof for lower bounds for property testing graph isomorphism.</p>



<p><strong>Robustly Self-Ordered Graphs: Constructions and Applications to Property Testing </strong>by Oded Goldreich and Avi Wigderson (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/149/">ECCC</a>). Let’s start from the application. The aim is to prove the following property testing lower bounds for the bounded-degree graph setting: an exponential separation between tolerant and vanilla testing, and finding an efficiently decidable property (in polynomial time) that cannot be property tested in sublinear time. For binary strings, results of this form are known. Can these be “ported” to the bounded-degree graph world? Can we construct graphs such that adjacency queries reduce to bit queries in strings? Naturally, one can simply represent the adjacency list as a string and treat graph queries as bit queries. But the problem is that of isomorphisms: different bit strings could represent the same graph and therefore, the different bit strings must have the same status with respect to the underlying property. The key insight in this paper is to introduce <em>robustly self-ordered graph</em>s, as a tool to port bit string property testing lower bounds to bounded-degree graphs. Such graphs essentially have a unique (identity) automorphism, even after a few edge insert/deletes. The actual definition is more technical, but that is the essence. The main result is an explicit construction of such graphs, from which the lower bound can be ported directly through a convenient lemma.</p>



<p><strong>Modifying a Graph’s Degree Sequence and the Testablity of Degree Sequence Properties </strong>by Lior Gishboliner (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.12697.pdf">arXiv</a>). A sequence of numbers \(D = (d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n)\) is graphic if there exists an undirected graph on \(n\) vertices whose degrees are precisely the numbers of the sequence. Graphical sequences have been characterized by classic results of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Gallai_theorem">Erdös-Gállai</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havel%E2%80%93Hakimi_algorithm">Havel-Hakimi</a>. This paper first proves the following theorem. Suppose a graphic sequence \(D’\) has \(l_1\)-distance at most \(\delta\) from the degree sequence \(D\) of a graph \(G\). Then, there exists a graph \(G’\) with degree sequence \(D’\) such that the (dense graph) distance between \(G\) and \(G’\) is \(O(\sqrt{\delta})\). This theorem is used to prove an interesting property testing result. Let \(\mathcal{D}\) be a subset of graphic sequences that are closed under permutation. Let \(\mathcal{G}\) be the set of graphs that have a degree sequence in \(\mathcal{D}\). Then \(\mathcal{G}\) can be tested in \(poly(1/\epsilon)\) queries.</p>



<p><strong>Sampling an Edge Uniformly in Sublinear Time</strong> by Jakub Têtek (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11178.pdf">arXiv</a>). In the general model for sublinear algorithms on graphs, an important choice is whether one allows uniform random edge queries. A natural question is whether such queries can simulated efficiently, using only random vertex, degree, and neighbor queries. This problem appears somewhat implicitly in previous sublinear subgraph counting algorithms, and <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2019/10628/pdf/LIPIcs-ICALP-2019-52.pdf">Eden-Ron-Rosenbaum</a> study it explicitly. They prove that one can sample from an \(\epsilon\)-approximate uniform distribution (over edges) using \(O(n/\sqrt{\epsilon m})\) samples. The problem of sampling from exactly the uniform distribution is left open. Until this paper. The main result shows that by modifying the Eden-Ron-Rosenbaum algorithm parameters, one can generate edge samples from an \(\epsilon\)-approximate uniform distribution using \(O((n/\sqrt{m})\log \epsilon^{-1})\) samples. The exact uniform distribution is achieved by setting \(\epsilon = 1/n\), to get a sample complexity of \(O((n\log n)/\sqrt{m})\).</p>



<p><strong>Faster Property Testers in a Variation of the Bounded Degree Model </strong>by Isolde Adler and Polly Fahey (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07770.pdf">arXiv</a>). The setting of bounded-degree graph property testing naturally extends to bounded-degree relational databases, which can be thought of as “directed” hypergraphs. This is an interesting new direction of research, that combines property testing with database theory (see <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/157699299.pdf">Adler-Harwath</a> and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3294052.3319679">Chen-Yoshida</a>). One of the main contributions of this work is to consider another notion of distance: edge and vertex inserts/deletes. This is a natural extension, and we can now compare distances between graphs/databases with different numbers of vertices. The main result is that, under this notion of distance, a large class of properties can be tested in constant running time on databases with bounded degree and treewidth. Specifically, any property expressible in Counting Monadic Second-Order Logic (CMSO) can be tested in constant time. Previous results by Alder-Harwath showed that such properties can be tested (under the standard distance notion) in constant queries, but polylogarithmic time. </p>



<p><strong>Optimal Testing of Discrete Distributions with High Probability</strong> by Ilias Diakonikolas, Themis Gouleakis, Daniel M. Kane, John Peebles, and Eric Price (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06540">arXiv</a>, <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/140/">ECCC</a>). The focus of this paper is distribution testing in the “high probability” regime, where we wish the error of the tester to be \(&lt; \delta\). Typically, most results just get an error of at most \(1/3\), from which standard probabilistic boosting would tack on an extra \(O(\log 1/\delta)\) factor. In standard TCS settings, one doesn’t focus on optimizing this dependence, but in statistics, there is significant focus on the optimal sample complexity. And indeed, for practical applications, it is crucial to have sharp bounds on the right number of samples required for hypothesis testing. The paper also argues that getting the optimal sample complexity requires new algorithms, even for uniformity testing. There are optimal results given for closeness and independence testing. The optimal sample complexity only pays a multiplicative factor of \(\log^{1/3} (1/\delta)\) or \(\log^{1/2}(1/\delta)\) over the optimal bound for constant error (with other additive terms depending on \(\log(1/\delta)\)).</p></div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: We consider statistical inference tasks in a distributed setting where access to data samples is subjected to strict “local constraints,” through a unified framework that captures communication limitations and (local) privacy constraints as special cases. We study estimation (learning) and goodness-of-fit (testing) for both discrete and high-dimensional distributions. Our goal is to understand how the sample complexity increases under the information constraints.<br /><br />In this talk we will provide an overview of this field and a sample of some of our results. We will discuss the role of (public) randomness  and interactivity in information-constrained inference, and make a case for thinking about randomness and interactivity as resources.<br /><br />The work is part of a long-term ongoing collaboration with Clément Canonne (IBM Research) and Himanshu Tyagi (IISc), and includes works done with Cody Freitag (Cornell), Yanjun Han (Stanford), Yuhan Liu (Cornell), and Ziteng Sun (Cornell). </p></blockquote></div>

<p>The next Foundations of Data Science virtual talk will take place on Friday, Oct 09th at 10:00 AM Pacific Time (1:00 pm Eastern Time, 18:00 Central European Time, 17:00 UTC).  <strong>Alexandr Andoni </strong>from Columbia University will speak about “<em><strong>Approximating Edit Distance in Near-Linear Time</strong></em>”.</p>



<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Edit distance is a classic measure of similarity between strings, with applications ranging from computational biology to coding. Computing edit distance is also a classic dynamic programming problem, with a quadratic run-time solution, often taught in the “Intro to Algorithms” classes. Improving this runtime has been a decades-old challenge, now ruled likely-impossible using tools from the modern area of fine-grained complexity. We show how to approximate the edit distance between two strings in near-linear time, up to a constant factor. Our result completes a research direction set forth in the breakthrough paper of [Chakraborty, Das, Goldenberg, Koucky, Saks; FOCS’18], which showed the first constant-factor approximation algorithm with a (strongly) sub-quadratic running time.</p>

<p>
Emil Faber is the pretend founder of the pretend Faber College. The 1978 movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_House">Animal House</a> starts with a close-up of Faber’s statue, which has the inscription, <b>Knowledge Is Good</b>.</p>
<p>
Today, Ken and I thought we might talk about knowledge, science, mathematics, proofs, and more.</p>
<p>
The phrase on Faber’s pedestal is meant to be a joke, as is the subtitle we added saying the same about science. But there is some truth to both of them. From the cause of climate change to the best response to the current pandemic to sports predictions there is much interest in science. Science is good, indeed.</p>

<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Science </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What is science and what are methods of creating knowledge via science? There is a whole world on the philosophy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science">science</a>. The central questions are: What is science? What methods are used to create new science? Is science good?—just kidding. </p>
<p>
We are not experts on the philosophy of science. But there seem to be three main ways to create scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>Experiments:</i> This is the classic one. Think about the testing of a candidate vaccine to stop the pandemic. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>Computational Experiments:</i> This is relatively new. Think computer simulations of how climate change is effected by the methods of creating energy—for example. wind vs. coal. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>Mathematical Proofs:</i> This is the one we focus on here at GLL. Think proofs that some algorithm works or that there is no algorithm that can work unless… </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Mathematical Proofs </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We are interested in creating knowledge via proving new theorems. This is how we try to create knowledge. Our science is based not on experiments and not on simulations but mostly on the theorem-proof method. Well not exactly. We do use experiments and simulations. For example, the field of quantum algorithms uses both of these.</p>
<p>
However, math proofs are the basis of complexity theory. This means that we need to create proofs and then check that they are correct. The difficulty of checking a proof is based on who created them: </p>
<ul>
<li>
You did—checking your own work. <p></p>
</li><li>
Someone else did—refereeing for a journal. <p></p>
</li><li>
Someone in your class did—grading exams. <p></p>
</li><li>
Some graduate student did—mentoring. <p></p>
</li><li>
Someone on the web who claims a major result like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" /> did—debugging. <p></p>
</li><li>
And so on.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> My Favorite Checking Method </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
My favorite tool for checking is this trick: Suppose that we have a proof <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> that demonstrates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Cimplies+X%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A \implies X}" class="latex" title="{A \implies X}" /> is true. Sometimes it is possible to show that there is a proof <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Q}" class="latex" title="{Q}" /> that proves <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Cimplies+Y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A \implies Y}" class="latex" title="{A \implies Y}" /> where: </p>
<ol>
<li>
The proof <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Q}" class="latex" title="{Q}" /> is based on changing the claimed proof <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" />. <p></p>
</li><li>
The proof <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Q}" class="latex" title="{Q}" /> demonstrates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Cimplies+Y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A \implies Y}" class="latex" title="{A \implies Y}" />, and; <p></p>
</li><li>
The statement <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> does not follow from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />.
</li></ol>
<p>
One way this commonly arises is when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> as a proof did not use all of the assumptions in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />. Thus <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> really proves more that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> and it proves <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" />. But we note that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> is not a consequence of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />.</p>
<p>
For example, consider the Riemann hypothesis. Suppose that we claim that we have a proof that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%5E%7Bs%7D%7D+%5Cneq+0+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}} \neq 0 " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}} \neq 0 " /></p>
<p>follows from the usual axioms of math plus <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CRe%28s%29+%3E+1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\Re(s) &gt; 1/2}" class="latex" title="{\Re(s) &gt; 1/2}" />. Sounds great. But suppose this is based on an argument that assumes that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%5E%7Bs%7D%7D+%3D+0+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}} = 0 " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}} = 0 " /></p>
<p>and manipulates the summation, eventually yielding a contradiction, without using the condition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CRe%28s%29+%3E+1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\Re(s) &gt; 1/2}" class="latex" title="{\Re(s) &gt; 1/2}" />. This is a problem, since there are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{s}" class="latex" title="{s}" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CRe%28s%29+%3D+1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\Re(s) = 1/2}" class="latex" title="{\Re(s) = 1/2}" /> so that the sum is zero. This is an example of the above method of checking. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> A New Checking Method </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
From time to time claims are made of resolutions to famous conjectures. Think <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" />. These claims have all been wrong to date. So most researchers are reluctant to take time to check any new claims. Why would you take the effort to try and find the bug that is likely there? </p>
<p>
I wonder if there could be a method that is based on competition. For concreteness, suppose Alice and Bob are two researchers who both claim a resolution to the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P}}" /> versus <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" /> problem. Alice has a lower bound argument that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" /> and Bob has an upper bound that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" />. Could we have them play a “game”? </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Give their papers to each other. Have them try to find a flaw in each other’s paper. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
They are highly motivated. Could we argue that if they cannot find any flaw then we would be slightly more motivated to look at the papers? </p>
<p>
This might work even if they both claim <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" />. Ken and I, personally, have had more claims of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" /> brought to our attention. Even in this case they would be highly motivated: the awards, the prizes, the praise will go to the one who is correct. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Possible Extensions </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
One difference in our situation from classic empirical science is the nature of gaps in knowledge. For example, one of the big current controversies in physics is over the existence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter">dark matter</a>. The Wikipedia article we just linked seems to date mostly to years around 2012 when dark matter was more widely accepted than <a href="https://medium.com/futuresin/doubting-dark-matter-f3e400c7dcd7">strikes</a> us <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-dark-matter-real/">today</a> (see also <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2019/10/dark-matter-nightmare-what-if-we-just.html">this</a> and <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2020/03/are-dark-energy-and-dark-matter.html">this</a>). There are cases where two competing theories are incompatible yet the available data do not suffice to find a fault in either. </p>
<p>
Whereas, with claimed proofs of incompatible statements, such as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" />, at least one must have a demonstrable error. The statements themselves may have barriers all the way up to undecidability, but that does not matter to judging the proffered proofs.</p>
<p>
The method may be more applicable in life sciences where the gap is gathering sufficient field or lab observations. For a topical example, consider claims about the risk or safety of human gatherings amid the pandemic. One extreme is represented by the extraordinary <a href="http://ftp.iza.org/dp13670.pdf">claim</a>, which is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-much-do-crowds-contribute-to-covid-its-complicated/">evidently</a> quite <a href="https://bgr.com/2020/09/14/sturgis-bike-rally-paper-impact-on-covid-19-coronavirus-cases/">excessive</a>, that the Sturgis motorcycle rally in August led to over 250,000 Covid-19 cases. The other extreme would be analyses used to justify gatherings with minimal precautions. The extremes cannot coexist. The means to arbitrate between them are available in principle but require costly social effort for contact tracing and testing as well as resolving mathematical issues between epidemiological models.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What do you think of our new checking method? Should it be more widely employed for evaluating claims and hypotheses?</p>

we show an $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ lower bound on the distance to submodularity.

<p>These results stand in contrast to the case of approximate modularity, where
the distance to modularity is a constant, and approximate convexity, where the
distance to convexity is logarithmic.

Tóth</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02908">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>Lightness and sparsity are two natural parameters for Euclidean
$(1+\epsilon)$-spanners. Classical results show that, when the dimension $d\in
\mathbb{N}$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$ are constant, every set $S$ of $n$ points in
$d$-space admits an $(1+\epsilon)$-spanners with $O(n)$ edges and weight
proportional to that of the Euclidean MST of $S$. Tight bounds on the
dependence on $\epsilon&gt;0$ for constant $d\in \mathbb{N}$ have been established
only recently. Le and Solomon (FOCS 2019) showed that Steiner points can
substantially improve the lightness and sparsity of a $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner.
They gave upper bounds of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-(d+1)/2})$ for the minimum
lightness in dimensions $d\geq 3$, and $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-(d-1))/2})$ for
the minimum sparsity in $d$-space for all $d\geq 1$. They obtained lower bounds
only in the plane ($d=2$). Le and Solomon (ESA 2020) also constructed Steiner
$(1+\epsilon)$-spanners of lightness $O(\epsilon^{-1}\log\Delta)$ in the plane,
where $\Delta\in \Omega(\log n)$ is the \emph{spread} of $S$, defined as the
ratio between the maximum and minimum distance between a pair of points.
</p>
<p>In this work, we improve several bounds on the lightness and sparsity of
Euclidean Steiner $(1+\epsilon)$-spanners. Using a new geometric analysis, we
establish lower bounds of $\Omega(\epsilon^{-d/2})$ for the lightness and
$\Omega(\epsilon^{-(d-1)/2})$ for the sparsity of such spanners in Euclidean
$d$-space for all $d\geq 2$. We use the geometric insight from our lower bound
analysis to construct Steiner $(1+\epsilon)$-spanners of lightness
$O(\epsilon^{-1}\log n)$ for $n$ points in Euclidean plane.

(GNNs), we propose the first method that exploits vector flows over graphs to
develop globally consistent directional and asymmetric aggregation functions.
We show that our directional graph networks (DGNs) generalize convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) when applied on a grid. Whereas recent theoretical works
focus on understanding local neighbourhoods, local structures and local
isomorphism with no global information flow, our novel theoretical framework
allows directional convolutional kernels in any graph. First, by defining a
vector field in the graph, we develop a method of applying directional
derivatives and smoothing by projecting node-specific messages into the field.
Then we propose the use of the Laplacian eigenvectors as such vector field, and
we show that the method generalizes CNNs on an n-dimensional grid. Finally, we
bring the power of CNN data augmentation to graphs by providing a means of
doing reflection, rotation and distortion on the underlying directional field.
We evaluate our method on different standard benchmarks and see a relative
error reduction of 8% on the CIFAR10 graph dataset and 11% to 32% on the
molecular ZINC dataset. An important outcome of this work is that it enables to
translate any physical or biological problems with intrinsic directional axes
into a graph network formalism with an embedded directional field.

$\mathbb{F}_2^n$. The goal is to recover the individual subspaces, given
samples from a (weighted) mixture of samples drawn uniformly from the two
subspaces $A_0$ and $A_1$.
</p>
<p>This problem is computationally challenging, as it captures the notorious
problem of "learning parities with noise" in the degenerate setting when $A_1
\subseteq A_0$. This is in contrast to the analogous problem over the reals
that can be solved in polynomial time (Vidal'03). This leads to the following
natural question: is Learning Parities with Noise the only computational
barrier in obtaining efficient algorithms for learning mixtures of subspaces
over $\mathbb{F}_2^n$?
</p>
<p>The main result of this paper is an affirmative answer to the above question.
Namely, we show the following results: 1. When the subspaces $A_0$ and $A_1$
are incomparable, i.e., $A_0$ and $A_1$ are not contained inside each other,
then there is a polynomial time algorithm to recover the subspaces $A_0$ and
$A_1$. 2. In the case when $A_1$ is a subspace of $A_0$ with a significant gap
in the dimension i.e., $dim(A_1) \le \alpha dim(A_1)$ for $\alpha&lt;1$, there is
a $n^{O(1/(1-\alpha))}$ time algorithm to recover the subspaces $A_0$ and
$A_1$.
</p>
<p>Thus, our algorithms imply computational tractability of the problem of
learning mixtures of two subspaces, except in the degenerate setting captured
by learning parities with noise.

classes, such as BPP, BQP, MA, QMA, etc., this property remains open for StoqMA
since Bravyi, Bessen and Terhal defined this class in 2006. In this note, we
show that an error reduction for StoqMA will, perhaps surprisingly, imply that
StoqMA = MA.

graph problem. One way to deal with its computational hardness, is to trade the
qualitative performance of an algorithm (allowing non-optimal outputs) for an
improved running time. For the vertex cover problem, there is a gap between
theory and practice when it comes to understanding this tradeoff. On the one
hand, it is known that it is NP-hard to approximate a minimum vertex cover
within a factor of $\sqrt{2}$. On the other hand, a simple greedy algorithm
yields close to optimal approximations in practice.
</p>
<p>A promising approach towards understanding this discrepancy is to recognize
the differences between theoretical worst-case instances and real-world
networks. Following this direction, we close the gap between theory and
practice by providing an algorithm that efficiently computes close to optimal
vertex cover approximations on hyperbolic random graphs; a network model that
closely resembles real-world networks in terms of degree distribution,
clustering, and the small-world property. More precisely, our algorithm
computes a $(1 + o(1))$-approximation, asymptotically almost surely, and has a
running time of $\mathcal{O}(m \log(n))$.
</p>
<p>The proposed algorithm is an adaption of the successful greedy approach,
enhanced with a procedure that improves on parts of the graph where greedy is
not optimal. This makes it possible to introduce a parameter that can be used
to tune the tradeoff between approximation performance and running time. Our
empirical evaluation on real-world networks shows that this allows for
improving over the near-optimal results of the greedy approach.

InstaHide, a simple encryption of training images, which can be plugged into
existing distributed deep learning pipelines. The encryption is efficient and
applying it during training has minor effect on test accuracy.
</p>
<p>InstaHide encrypts each training image with a "one-time secret key" which
consists of mixing a number of randomly chosen images and applying a random
pixel-wise mask. Other contributions of this paper include: (a) Using a large
public dataset (e.g. ImageNet) for mixing during its encryption, which improves
security. (b) Experimental results to show effectiveness in preserving privacy
against known attacks with only minor effects on accuracy. (c) Theoretical
analysis showing that successfully attacking privacy requires attackers to

been a growing interest in neural architectures that are invariant or
equivariant to all three shape-preserving transformations of point clouds:
translation, rotation, and permutation.

<p>In this paper, we present a first study of the approximation power of these
architectures. We first derive two sufficient conditions for an equivariant
architecture to have the universal approximation property, based on a novel

devising two other novel universal architectures.

data structure for the closest pair problem. Our solution is based on a serial
dynamic closest pair data structure by Golin et al. [SIAM J.\ on Computing,
1998], and supports batches of insertions and deletions in parallel. For a data
set of size $n$, our data structure supports a batch of insertions or deletions
of size $m$ in $O(m\log (1+(n+m)/m))$ expected work and $O(\log
(n+m)\log^*(n+m))$ depth with high probability, and takes linear space. The key
techniques for achieving these bounds are a new work-efficient parallel
batch-dynamic binary heap, and careful management of the computation across
multiple points to minimize work and depth.
</p>
<p>We provide an optimized multicore implementation of our data structure using
dynamic hash tables, parallel heaps, and dynamic $k$-d trees. Our experiments
on a variety of synthetic and real-world data sets show that it achieves a
parallel speedup of up to 38.57x (15.10x on average) on 48 cores with
hyper-threading. In addition, we also implement and compare four parallel
algorithms for static closest pair problem, for which no practical
implementations exist in the literature. On 48 cores with hyper-threading, the
algorithms achieve up to 51.45x (29.42x on average) speedup, and Rabin's
algorithm performs the best on average. Comparing our dynamic algorithm to the
fastest static algorithm, we find that it is advantageous to use the dynamic
algorithm for batch sizes of up to 70\% of the data set. As far as we know, our
work is the first to experimentally evaluate parallel algorithms for the
closest pair problem, in both the static and the dynamic settings.

amount of shared randomness, which can be as low as a single bit, reduces the
cost in both cases. Specifically, we derive lower bounds on the cost attainable
by any algorithm with unrestricted use of shared randomness and propose
near-optimal solutions that use a small number of shared random bits. Finally,
we discuss open problems and future directions.

model, in both adjacency matrix and adjacency list settings, we improve on the
best known algorithms for general graphs, matching previously obtained results
for bipartite graphs. In particular, for a graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges,
our algorithm makes $O(n^{7/4})$ queries in the matrix model and
$O(n^{3/4}m^{1/2})$ queries in the list model. Our approach combines Gabow's
classical maximum matching algorithm [Gabow, Fundamenta Informaticae, '17] with
the guessing tree method of Beigi and Taghavi [Beigi and Taghavi, Quantum,
'20].

<p>David Blackwell was still roaming the corridors of UC Berkeley’s stat department during my postdoc years, circa 2009. Jake Abernethy, Sasha Rakhlin, Peter Bartlett and myself were discussing his results, and his seminal contributions to prediction theory were already well known.</p>

<p>At that time, still the early days of online convex optimization, we were contemplating everything from adaptive gradient methods to bandit convex optimization. Blackwell’s famed approachability theorem was looming in the background, considered to be one of the strongest theorems in the ML-theorists toolkit. </p>



<p>I’ve recently added a new draft chapter to to V2.0 of <a href="http://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu">Introduction to Online Convex Optimization</a>, about the connection between OCO and Blackwell approachability: they are algorithmically equivalent! More precisely, an efficient algorithm for approachability gives rise to an efficient algorithm for OCO with sublinear regret, and vice versa. </p>



<p>Details are in the chapter draft, and  I recommend this music for reading it: (the song is called “together we won despite everything”, dedicated to music and science)</p>

Everything pre-covid seems at least five years ago to me, so it's hard to believe that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383">MIP* = RE</a> is a 2020 result. To remind you, consider the model where we have two powerful provers put in separate rooms where they can't communicate (think suspects of a crime put in separate interrogation rooms). An computationally efficient verifier can ask them questions based on random coins. Thirty years ago, Laszlo Babai, Carsten Lund and myself <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01200056">showed</a> that every language in nondeterministic exponential time has proofs in this model.<div><br /></div><div>Now suppose the provers have entangled quantum bits. This question has a long history that culminates in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383">MIP* = RE paper</a> earlier this year by Zhengfeng Ji, Anand Natarajan, Thomas Vidick, John Wright, Henry Yuen showing that every proof of any length can be proven in this model. Incredible!</div><div><br /></div><div>But wait, why is there a new version 2 dated last week? Turns out the MIP* = RE paper relied on a 2016 paper by Vidick which was later discovered to have a bug. No worries, as the authors of the MIP* = RE paper got around this issue by a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12982">quantum analysis</a> of a low-degree test from that old Babai-Fortnow-Lund paper.</div><div><br /></div><div>Vidick's <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/09/29/it-happens-to-everyonebut-its-not-fun/">blog post</a> explains it all, including the angst of a major result falling apart temporarily. He has <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/01/babai-strikes-back.html">good</a> <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/24/error/how-maths-most-famous-proof-nearly-broke">company</a>.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>[C]hildren with special abilities and skills need to be nourished and encouraged.  They are a national treasure.  Challenging programs for the “gifted” are sometimes decried as “elitism.”  Why aren’t intensive practice sessions for varsity football, baseball, and basketball players and interschool competition deemed elitism?  After all, only the most gifted athletes participate.  There is a self-defeating double standard at work here, nationwide.<br />—Carl Sagan, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Demon-Haunted-World-Science-Candle-Dark/dp/0345409469"><em>The Demon-Haunted World</em></a> (1996)</p></blockquote>



<p>I’d like you to feel about the <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/09/23/rallying-to-protect-admissions-standards-at-americas-best-public-high-school/">impending destruction</a> of Virginia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson_High_School_for_Science_and_Technology">Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology</a>, the same way you might’ve felt when the Taliban threatened to blow up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhas_of_Bamyan">Bamyan Buddhas</a>, and then days later actually did blow them up.  Or the way you felt when human negligence caused wildfires that incinerated half the koalas in Australia, or turned the San Francisco skyline into an orange hellscape.  For that matter, the same way most of us felt the day Trump was elected.  I’d like you to feel in the bottom of your stomach the <em>avoidability</em>, and yet the finality, of the loss.</p>



<p>For thousands of kids in the DC area, especially first- or second-generation immigrants, TJHS represented a lifeline.  Score high enough on an entrance exam—something hard but<em> totally within your control</em>—and you could attend a school where, instead of the other kids either tormenting or ignoring you, they might teach you Lisp or the surreal number system.  Where you could learn humility instead of humiliation.</p>



<p>When I visited TJHS back in 2012 to give a quantum computing talk, I toured the campus, chatted with students, fielded their questions, and thought: so <em>this</em> is the teenagerhood—the ironically <em>normal</em> teenagerhood—that I was denied by living someplace else.  I found myself wishing that a hundred more TJHS’s, large and small, would sprout up across the country.  I felt like if I could further that goal then, though the universe return to rubble, my life would’ve had a purpose.</p>



<p>Instead, of course, our sorry country is destroying the few such schools that exist.  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/nyregion/specialized-schools-nyc-deblasio.html">Stuyvesant and Bronx Science</a> in New York, and the Liberal Arts and Science Academy here in Austin, are also under mortal threat right now.  The numerous parents who moved, who arranged their lives, specifically so that these schools might later be available for “high-risk” kids were suckered.</p>



<p>Assuming you haven’t just emerged from 30 years in a Tibetan cave, you presumably know why this is happening.  As the <em>Washington Post</em>‘s Jay Matthews <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/americas-top-sat-school-makes-another-disputed-attempt-at-diversity/2020/10/03/1bef3db2-0261-11eb-897d-3a6201d6643f_story.html?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_most&amp;carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F2bf01fe%2F5f78a5d19d2fda0efb3d8031%2F5974cf76ade4e21a8497eeb1%2F42%2F62%2F2b179e7390f19bdba6f66f626ab37646">explains</a>, the Fairfax County School Board is “embarrassed” to have a school that, despite all its outreach attempts, remains only 5% Black and Latino—even though, crucially, the school <em>also</em> happens to be only 19% White (it’s now ~75% Asian).</p>



<p>You might ask: so then why doesn’t TJHS just institute affirmative action, like almost every university does?  It seems there’s an extremely interesting answer: <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/04/26/is-the-no-1-high-school-in-america-thomas-jefferson-fairfax-discrimination/">they did in the 1990s</a>, and Black and Hispanic enrollment surged.  But then the verdicts of court cases, brought by right-wing groups, made the school district fear that they’d be open to lawsuits if they continued with affirmative action, so they dropped it.  Now the boomerang has returned, and the School Board has decided on a more drastic remedy: namely, to eliminate the TJHS entrance exam entirely, and replace it by a lottery for anyone whose GPA exceeds 3.5.</p>



<p>The trouble is, TJHS without an entrance exam is no longer TJHS.  More likely than not, such a place would simply converge to become another of the thousands of schools across the US where success is based on sports, networking, and popularity.  And if by some miracle it avoided that fate, <em>still</em> it would no longer be available to most of the kids who‘d most need it.</p>



<p>So yes, the district is <strong>embarrassed</strong>—note that the<em> Washington Post</em> writer explains it as if that’s the most obvious, natural reaction in the world—to host a school that’s regularly ranked #1 in the US, with the highest average SATs and a distinguished list of alumni.  To avoid this embarrassment, the solution is (in effect) to burn the school to the ground.</p>



<p>In a world-historic irony, the main effect of this “solution” will be to <strong>drastically limit the number of Asian students, while drastically <em>increasing</em> (!!!) the number of White students</strong>.  The proportion of Black and Hispanic students is projected to increase a bit but remain small.  Let me say that one more time: in practice, TJHS’s move from a standardized test to a lottery will be<strong> overwhelmingly pro-White, anti-Asian, and anti-immigrant</strong>; only as a much smaller effect will it be pro-underrepresented-minority.</p>



<p>In spite of covid and everything else going on, hundreds of students and parents have been <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/09/23/rallying-to-protect-admissions-standards-at-americas-best-public-high-school/">protesting in front of TJHS</a> to try to prevent the school’s tragic and pointless destruction.  But it sounds like TJHS’s fate might be sealed.  The school board tolerated excellence for 35 more years than it wanted to; now its patience is at an end.</p>



<p>Some will say: sure, the end of TJHS is unfortunate, Scott, but why do you let this stuff <em>weigh</em> on you so heavily?  This is merely another instance of friendly fire, of good people fighting the just war against racism, and in <em>one</em> case hitting a target that, yeah, OK, probably should’ve been spared.  On reflection, though, I can accept that only insofar as I accept that it was “friendly fire” when Bolsheviks targeted the kulaks, or (much more comically, less importantly, and less successfully) when Arthur Chu, Amanda Marcotte, and a thousand other woke-ists targeted me.  With friendly fire like that, who needs enemy fire?</p>



<p>If you care about the gifted Black and Hispanic kids of Fairfax County, then like me, you should demand a change in the law to allow the reinstatement of affirmative action for them.  You should acknowledge that the issue lies there and not with TJHS itself.</p>



<p>I don’t see how you reach the point of understanding all the facts and still wanting to dismantle TJHS, over the desperate pleas of the students and parents, without a decent helping of <em>resentment</em> toward the kind of student who flourishes there—without a wish to see those uppity,  “fresh off the boat” Chinese and Indian grinds get dragged down to where they belong.  And if you tell me that such magnet programs need to end even though you yourself once benefitted from them—well, isn’t that more contemptible still?  Aren’t you knowingly burning a bridge you crossed so that a younger generation can’t follow you, basically reassuring the popular crowd that if they’ll only accept <em>you</em>, then there won’t be a hundred more greasy nerds in your tow?  And if, on some level, you already know these things about yourself, then the only purpose of this post has been to remind you of them.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>As for the news that dominates the wires and inevitably preempts what I’ve written: <strong>I wish for his successful recovery, followed by his losing the election and spending the rest of his life in New York State prison</strong>.  (And I look forward to seeing how woke Twitter summarizes the preceding statement—e.g., “Aaronson, his mask finally off, conveys well-wishes to Donald Trump”…)</p>

<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from 
<a class="entryheader" href="https://differentialprivacy.org" title="Differential Privacy">DifferentialPrivacy.org</a>
<p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Perhaps the best-studied problem in differential privacy is answering multiple counting queries.
The standard approach is to add independent, appropriately-calibrated (Laplace or Gaussian) noise to each query result and apply a composition theorem.
To bound the maximum error over the query answers, one takes a union bound over the independent noise samples.
However, this is <em>not</em> optimal.
The problem is to identify the optimal method (up to constant factors).</p>

<p><strong>Problem 1:</strong> Is there a randomized algorithm \(M : \{0,1\}^{n \times k} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k\) that is differentially private<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and satisfies
\[
\forall x \in \{0, 1\}^{n \times k} \quad \mathbb{E}\left[ \left\|M(x) - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right\|_\infty \right] \leq c \sqrt{k}
\]
for some constant \( c &gt; 0\) depending only on the privacy parameters?<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Adding independent Gaussian noise to each coordinate/query yields \(c \sqrt{k \log k}\) in place of \(c \sqrt{k}\) above. 
Steinke and Ullman [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06095">SU17</a>] showed that the union bound can <em>almost</em> be avoided and obtained \(c \sqrt{k \log \log k}\) using correlated noise.
The algorithm is nonetheless based on independent Gaussian noise, with the added step of using the exponential mechanism to identify high-error answers and correct them.</p>

<p>Note that a \(\Omega(\sqrt{k})\) lower bound is known [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3158">BUV18</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06095">SU17</a>]. By [<a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~bhaskara/files/privacy.pdf">BDKT12</a>] it suffices to consider mechanisms \(M\) that add <em>instance-independent noise</em>. That is, \(M(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i + Z\) where \(Z\) is some fixed noise distribution over \(\mathbb{R}^k\) that is independent of \(x\).</p>

<p><strong>Reward:</strong> For a positive solution, an all-you-can-eat sushi dinner at a sushi restaurant of your choice.
If the solution is an efficiently-sampleable distribution with a closed-form density, alcohol will be included.
For a negative solution, alcohol only.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

A very recent work by Ganesh and Zhao [<a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~arunganesh/papers/generalizedgaussians.pdf">GZ20</a>] improves the best upper bound from \(c\sqrt{k \log \log k}\) to \(c\sqrt{k \log \log \log k}\).</p>

<p>You survey many many school children and ask each one:</p>



<p>Do you have more brothers than sisters? or more sisters than brothers? or the same number?</p>



<p>Then you separate the boys’s answers from the girls’s answers</p>



<p>Which of the following is true?</p>



<ol><li>The answers from boys will be tilted toward having MORE sisters and LESS brothers</li><li>The answers from boys will be tilted toward having MORE brothers and LESS sisters</li><li>There will be no (statistically significant) difference.      </li></ol>



<p><strong>The reason for answer 1 is</strong>: Since the ratio of boys/girls is 50/50, and you don’t count yourself in the answer, boys will tend to have more sisters and girls will tend to have more brothers</p>



<p><strong>The reason for answer 2 </strong>is: Some families are uneven and have more boys. In these families you will see more boys having more brothers than sisters and less girls having more brothers than sisters. Some families are uneven and have more girls. In these families you will see more girls having more sisters than brothers and less boys having more sisters than brothers. </p>

<p class="wp-block-quote">Abstract: Lifting theorems in complexity theory are a method of transferring lower bounds in a weak computational model into lower bounds for a more powerful computational model, via function composition. There has been an explosion of lifting theorems in the last ten years, essentially reducing communication lower bounds to query complexity lower bounds. These theorems only hold for composition with very specific “gadgets” such as indexing and inner product. <br /><br /> In this talk, we will present a generalization of the theorem lifting Nullstellensatz degree to monotone span program size by Pitassi and Robere (2018) so that it works for any gadget with high enough rank, in particular, for useful gadgets such as equality and greater-than. We will then explain how to apply our generalized theorem to solve three open problems: <br />– We present the first result that demonstrates a separation in proof power for cutting planes with unbounded versus polynomially bounded coefficients. Specifically, we exhibit CNF formulas that can be refuted in quadratic length and constant line space in cutting planes with unbounded coefficients, but for which there are no refutations in subexponential length and subpolynomial line space if coefficients are restricted to be of polynomial magnitude.<br />– We give the strongest separation to-date between monotone Boolean formulas and monotone Boolean circuits. Namely, we show that the classical GEN problem, which has polynomial-size monotone Boolean circuits, requires monotone Boolean formulas of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B%5COmega%28n+%2F+%5Ctextrm%7Bpolylog%7D+n%29%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{\Omega(n / \textrm{polylog} n)}" class="latex" title="2^{\Omega(n / \textrm{polylog} n)}" />.<br />– We give the first explicit separation between monotone Boolean formulas and monotone real formulas. Namely, we give an explicit family of functions that can be computed with monotone real formulas of nearly linear size but require monotone Boolean formulas of exponential size. Previously only a non-explicit separation was known.<br /><br />This talk is based on joint work with Or Meir, Jakob Nordström, Toniann Pitassi, Robert Robere, and Marc Vinyals, available at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02144" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02144</a> </p></div>

A graph $G$ is called {\em self-ordered}\/ (a.k.a asymmetric) if the identity permutation is its only automorphism.
Equivalently, there is a unique isomorphism from $G$ to any graph that is isomorphic to $G$. 
We say that $G=(V,E)$ is {\em robustly self-ordered}\/ if the size of the symmetric difference between $E$ and the edge-set of the graph obtained by permuting $V$ using any permutation $\pi:V\to V$ is proportional to the number of non-fixed-points of $\pi$.

We show that robustly self-ordered bounded-degree graphs exist (in abundance), and that they can be constructed efficiently, in a strong sense.
Specifically, given the index of a vertex in such a graph, it is possible to find all its neighbors in polynomial-time (i.e., in time that is poly-logarithmic in the size of the graph).

We provide two very different constructions, in tools and structure. 
The first, a direct construction, is based on proving a sufficient condition for robust self-ordering, 
which requires that an auxiliary graph, on {\em pairs|}\/ of vertices of the original graph, is expanding. 
In this case the original graph is (not only robustly self-ordered but) also expanding.
The second construction proceeds in three steps: It boosts the mere existence of robustly self-ordered graphs, 
which provides explicit graphs of sublogarithmic size, to an efficient construction of polynomial-size graphs, 
and then, repeating it again, to exponential-size(robustly self-ordered) graphs that are locally constructible.
This construction can yield robustly self-ordered graphs that are either expanders or highly disconnected, having logarithmic size connected components. 

We also consider graphs of unbounded degree, seeking correspondingly unbounded robustness parameters.
We again demonstrate that such graphs (of linear degree) exist (in abundance), and give an explicit construction. 
This turns out to require very different tools, and the definition and constructions of new pseudo-random objects. 
Specifically, we show that the construction of such graphs reduces to the construction of non-malleable two-source extractors 
with very weak parameters but with an additional natural feature. 
Next, we reduce the construction of such non-malleable two-source extractors to the construction of ``relocation-detecting'' codes. Loosely speaking, in such code permuting arbitrarily the coordinates of a random codeword yields a string that is far any other codeword. We conclude by showing how to construct relocation-detecting codes (of various types, including ones with constant rate).  

We demonstrate that robustly self-ordered bounded-degree graphs are useful towards obtaining lower bounds on the query complexity of testing graph properties both in the bounded-degree and the dense graph models.  
Indeed, their robustness offers efficient, local and distance preserving reductions from testing problems on ordered structures (like sequences) to the unordered (effectively unlabeled) graphs. 
One of the results that we obtain, via such a reduction, is a subexponential separation 
between the complexity of testing and tolerant testing of graph properties in the bounded-degree graph model.</div>

Extending the classical ``hardness-to-randomness'' line-of-works, Doron et al. (FOCS 2020) recently proved that derandomization with near-quadratic time overhead is possible, under the assumption that there exists a function in $\mathcal{DTIME}[2^n]$ that cannot be computed by randomized SVN circuits of size $2^{(1-\epsilon)\cdot n}$ for a small $\epsilon$.

In this work we extend their inquiry and answer several open questions that arose from their work. Our main result is that *derandomization with almost no time overhead is possible*, under a plausible hypothesis. Specifically, we show that probabilistic algorithms that run in time $T(n)$ can be deterministically simulated in time $n\cdot T(n)^{1+\epsilon}$, under a hypothesis that is formally incomparable to the one of Doron et al., but is arguably more standard: We assume that there exist non-uniformly secure one-way functions, and that for $\delta=\delta(\epsilon)$ and $k=k_T(\epsilon)$ there exists a problem in $\mathcal{DTIME}[2^{k\cdot n}]$ that is hard for algorithms that run in time $2^{(k-\delta)\cdot n}$ and use $2^{(1-\delta)\cdot n}$ bits of advice. We also show that the latter hypothesis (or, more accurately, a relaxation of it that we use) is in fact necessary to obtain the derandomization conclusion if one relies on a PRG construction (as is indeed our approach).

For sub-exponential time functions $T(n)=2^{n^{o(1)}}$ we further improve the derandomization time to $n^{1+\epsilon}\cdot T(n)$, under a mildly stronger hypothesis. We also show that *the multiplicative time overhead of $n$ is essentially optimal*, conditioned on a counting version of the non-deterministic strong exponential-time hypothesis (i.e., on $\# NSETH$). Nevertheless, we show that *in the average-case setting a faster derandomization is possible*: Under hypotheses similar to the ones in our main result, we show that for every $L\in\mathcal{BPTIME}[n^k]$ there exists a deterministic algorithm $A_L$ running in time $n^{\epsilon}\cdot n^{k}$ such that for every distribution $\mathcal{D}$ over $\{0,1\}^n$ samplable in time $n^k$ it holds that $\Pr_{x\sim\mathcal{D}}[A_L(x)=L(x)]\ge1-n^{-\omega(1)}$. 

Lastly, we present an alternative proof for the result of Doron et al. using a *proof paradigm that is both considerably simpler and more general*; in fact, we show how to simplify the analysis of any construction that ``extracts randomness from a pseudoentropic string''. We use this simpler proof to extend their result, deducing a mildly slower derandomization (i.e., with cubic or quadratic overhead) from weaker hardness assumptions (i.e., for SVN circuits that do not use randomness).</div>

<h1></h1>



<p>A <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/01/14/a-masters-project/">recent post</a> on this blog concerned the posting of our paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383">MIP*=RE</a> on the arXiv and gave a personal history of the the sequence of works that led to the result. Quite unfortunately (dramatically?) a few weeks after initial posting of the paper (and the blog post) John Wright discovered an important error in the proof of a key result in this sequence: my paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/140956622">Three-player entangled XOR games are NP-hard to approximate</a>, published in 2016 in a special issue of the SIAM journal on computing dedicated to selected papers from the FOCS’13 conference. While I did not mention this paper directly in the previous blog post, its main result, a proof of soundness of the Raz-Safra low-degree test against entangled-player strategies, is a key ingredient in the proof of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03821">quantum low-degree test</a>, itself a key ingredient in the MIP*=RE paper. (Strictly speaking the latter paper relies on an extension of my result to two-player games obtained in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03062">follow-up</a> with Natarajan. Since that paper re-used the flawed part of my earlier analysis in a black-box manner it is similarly impacted.) So then…?</p>



<h2 id="scientific-aspects">Scientific aspects</h2>



<p>I’ll start with the science. The result MIP*=RE, to the best of our knowledge, remains correct. In order to remove the dependence of the proof on the flawed paper we extended the soundness analysis of Babai, Fortnow and Lund (BFL)’s multilinearity test against entangled provers from my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0550">paper with Ito</a> to the case of multivariate polynomials of low individual degree. (This extension, for the case of classical provers, is already mentioned in the BFL paper.) We just posted a self-contained analysis of that test on the arXiv <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12982">here</a> and updated the MIP*=RE paper to account for the replacement (see v2.). The latter paper is currently under review; on this I will simply say that, as for all mathematical works, it is advised to wait until the outcome of the refereeing process is complete before declaring confidence in the validity of the result. For a more in-depth description of the changes made I refer to the introduction of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12982">new paper</a>.</p>



<p>Our analysis of the “low individual-degree test” mentioned in the preceding paragraph can be used to recover the main result of my SICOMP’16 paper in a weakened form. Since the proof is different and does not directly fix the error I have decided to withdraw the paper from SICOMP. For more details on the error itself and consequences to other works, such as the quantum low-degree test and the quantum games PCP, I refer to the <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/errata.pdf">short note</a> I wrote to accompany the withdrawal of the paper. The one-sentence summary is that essentially all subsequent results expressed in terms of “high” complexity classes such as QMA-EXP, NEEXP, etc., still hold, while “scaled-down” results on the hardness of entangled games can only be recovered by allowing a substantial weakening of parameters. In particular, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03821">quantum low-degree test</a> holds in its scaled-up version (testing exp(n) EPR pairs using poly(n) resources), but the scaled-down version requires polylog(n) communication to test n EPR pairs, instead of O(log n) as claimed.</p>



<h2 id="personal-aspects">Personal aspects</h2>



<p>In addition to notifying researchers in the area of the bug, my goal in writing this blog post is to help me exorcise the demon of having a large mistake in one of my papers. In doing so I was inspired by Scott Aaronson’s <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2854">blog post</a> on a similar topic. (I’ll admit that even just linking explicitly to his post helps reassure myself, a power which I believe was one of Scott’s aims in writing the post. So, thanks Scott, and allow me to pass it on!) The faulty paper is not based on a minor back-of-the-envelope observation; in fact it is one that I was quite proud of. The mistake in it is not small either; it’s a mistake that I cannot find any excuse for having made. Yet here I am: after having spent the past 6 months trying to find an alternative proof, I now strongly believe that the problem cannot be solved using the kind of techniques that I had imagined could do so. Whether the theorem statement is true or not, I don’t know; but at the moment I am unable to prove it. I have to accept that there is a bug.</p>



<p>As painful as it is I realize that I am writing this post from a relatively comfortable position. Who knows if I would have been able to do the same had we not been able to recover a full proof of MIP*=RE. Moreover, after having banged my head against the problem for 6 months straight (COVID helping, walls were never far) I am now able to see my failure in a more positive light: the story I told in the previous blog post is not yet closed; there is an open challenge for me to solve. It is a very personal challenge; having spent the past 6 months delineating it I have accumulated sufficient grounds on which to believe that it is an interesting one. I feel grateful for this.</p>



<p>Getting there wasn’t easy. So, even though I am writing from a place of comfort, I want to share the pain that the whole adventure has caused me. This simple acknowledgment is especially directed at younger readers: so that when it happens to you, you will remember this post and know that you’re not the only one. That it happens to others as well and that it is possible to face, accept, and move away from such errors. Of course you will try to fix it first. Here are some quick tips. While banging your head on the problem, make sure that your understanding increases every day. To start with, do you really understand why there is a mistake? Of course some step doesn’t go through, but what is the simplest form of the incriminated statement that fails? Can you write it down? Can you formulate and prove a weaker form of it? Probe the issue with examples. Try to isolate it as much as you can: take it outside of the paper and formulate an entirely self-contained version of it, stripped of all the baggage. Place it in as many different contexts that you can think of: do you still believe it, does it stand on its own? Again, make sure that you learn. Even if you’re not able to fix the claim, are you exploring a new technique, discovering a new perspective? If it didn’t work yesterday it probably won’t work today either: make sure that you always find something new to inject. When you can no longer do this, it is time to stop. So make sure to set yourself some near-term (how much to think about this on any given day) and long-term (when to admit defeat) limits. Always remember that problems are much more often solved in the shower or while walking the dog than at the desk. Finally, be ready to move on. Realize that as bad as it may seem to you, there are more important things in life. You can’t reduce yourself to this one problem: you’ll be stronger for accepting what happened than trying to bury it at all costs. If you don’t see this by yourself, try to talk about it. Explain the situation you’re in to your close non-academia friends, to your parents; practice on your pet first if it helps. You will realize, as I eventually did (although it took quite a while) that <em>it is ok</em>.</p>



<h2 id="social-aspects">Social aspects</h2>



<p>After the scientific and the personal aspects, let me end with the sociological. This is a semi-tangent but it is a good opportunity to discuss a topic that we scientists, possibly even more so us working in the “hard sciences” (as the French call “proof-based” disciplines), are insufficiently sensitized to. This is the topic of how science is made, and what is the reality of this “absolute truth” that we claim to discover and establish in our mathematical results.</p>



<p>My paper was posted on arXiv in 2013, it was accepted to the FOCS conference and published in its proceedings the same year, and it appeared in the journal SICOMP in 2016. Both publications were refereed. Since its posting the paper has been cited 47 times (google scholar) and its main result is used in an essential way in at least half a dozen papers (my best guess). 7 years later a big hole has been found in the proof. How did the “truth value of my result evolve in the process? Was it always wrong or was there a time where it had truth, in whatever appropriate sense of the word?</p>



<p>I realize that these questions can be given trivial answers—I know what is an axiom and what is a proof system. Yet I am trying to push myself, and my reader, to look a little deeper. An analogy might help. The situation brought to mind a book by French philosopher of science Bruno Latour, called (in its English translation) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Laboratory-Life-Construction-Scientific-Facts/dp/069102832X">Laboratory Life: The Construction of Scientific Facts</a>. This is a wonderful book, which goes well beyond the classic misconceptions from Popper or even Kuhn; it should be mandatory reading for every scientist. In one of the early chapters of the book Latour makes a detailed study of how subsequent citations can collectively enshrine an initial claim based entirely on the citer’s conscious or unconscious biases in making use of the citation (i.e. in complete independence from any ground “truth” or “importance” of the cited work). An entertaining example of this can be found in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0306312714535679">this article</a>, which dissects the claim that “The myth from the 1930s that spinach is a rich source of iron was due to misleading information in the original publication: a malpositioned decimal point gave a 10-fold overestimate of iron content.” The example, pursued in great depth in the article, shows very well how one citation at a time the (spoiler: unjustified) claim is given more and more credibility until it eventually becomes a fact: from initial citations written in a tentative tone “according to Z, it could be that…” to more assertive citations “Z has shown that” by more and more well-known researchers in highly-read journals to pure fact (citation above). I highly recommend the article!</p>



<p>It is easy to dismiss this story as being the result of “sloppy” authors misrepresenting a “soft” claim whose truth value is not well-determined in the first place, being a statement about the world rather than about some hypothetical mathematical universe. Yet I believe that it is worth taking the time to examine with an open mind what exactly, if anything, distinguishes a claim about the iron content of spinach from the main “theorem” of my paper. From its initial posting on the arXiv to its presentation in a conference and its journal publication to the multiple citations it received through its use in subsequent works, and including multiple other considerations such as my own credibility (itself the result of so many other considerations) and the results base “believability”, when was the logical statement itself evaluated? Does it matter? Did the unchallenged existence of the result for 7 years impact the course of science? Or was it a mistake that was bound to be discovered and has no lasting consequences?</p>



<p>These are questions for the reader, that can be (and are probably better) asked in other contexts than the limited one of my result. Indeed there is a much broader point to all this, that I only meant to raise in an indirect manner. It is impossible to disregard the fact that our scientific work is grounded in cultural and societal effects, but we may disagree on the impact that this grounding has. We owe it to ourselves and to our readers (broadly interpreted—from colleagues to funding agencies to the broader public) to refuse to hide behind the thin veil of “hard science”, mathematics or logic, and educate ourselves to what it is that we really are doing.</p></div>

<p class="wp-block-quote">Abstract: In high-dimensional statistical problems (including planted clique, sparse PCA, community detection, etc.), the class of “low-degree polynomial algorithms” captures many leading algorithmic paradigms such as spectral methods, approximate message passing, and local algorithms on sparse graphs. As such, lower bounds against low-degree algorithms constitute concrete evidence for average-case hardness of statistical problems. This method has been widely successful at explaining and predicting statistical-to-computational gaps in these settings. <br />While prior work has understood the power of low-degree algorithms for problems with a “planted” signal, we consider here the setting of “random optimization problems” (with no planted signal), including the problem of finding a large independent set in a random graph, as well as the problem of optimizing the Hamiltonian of mean-field spin glass models. I will define low-degree algorithms in this setting, argue that they capture the best known algorithms, and explain new proof techniques for giving lower bounds against low-degree algorithms in this setting. The proof involves a variant of the so-called “overlap gap property”, which is a structural property of the solution space.<br /><br />Based on joint work with David Gamarnik and Aukosh Jagannath, available at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12063">arXiv:2004.12063</a>.</p></div>
