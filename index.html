problems of the form $\min_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \max_{y\in\mathcal{Y}} y^\top A
x$ which contain linear programming, classification, and regression as special
cases. Our methods push existing fully stochastic sublinear methods and
variance-reduced methods towards their limits in terms of per-iteration
complexity and sample complexity. We obtain nearly-constant per-iteration
complexity by designing efficient data structures leveraging Taylor
approximations to the exponential and a binomial heap. We improve sample
complexity via low-variance gradient estimators using dynamic sampling
distributions that depend on both the iterates and the magnitude of the matrix
entries.
</p>
<p>Our runtime bounds improve upon those of existing primal-dual methods by a
factor depending on sparsity measures of the $m$ by $n$ matrix $A$. For
example, when rows and columns have constant $\ell_1/\ell_2$ norm ratios, we
offer improvements by a factor of $m+n$ in the fully stochastic setting and
$\sqrt{m+n}$ in the variance-reduced setting. We apply our methods to
computational geometry problems, i.e. minimum enclosing ball, maximum inscribed
ball, and linear regression, and obtain improved complexity bounds. For linear
regression with an elementwise nonnegative matrix, our guarantees improve on
exact gradient methods by a factor of $\sqrt{\mathrm{nnz}(A)/(m+n)}$.

undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ subject to edge deletions. Our first result is an
algorithm that maintains $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate distances from a set of $s$
sources in $\tilde{O}(sm)$ total update time, assuming that $s= n^{\Omega(1)}$,
$\epsilon = \Omega(1)$ and $|E|= n^{1+\Omega(1)}$.
</p>
<p>This matches the best known static algorithm, up to polylogarithmic factors
for a wide range of settings.
</p>
<p>The currently best known algorithm for the problem is obtained by running the
single-source algorithm of [Henzinger, Krinninger and Nanongkai, FOCS'14]
independently from each source. Our result improves over the update time bound
of this solution by removing a $2^{\tilde{O}(\log^{3/4} n)}$ factor.
Additionally, we can maintain a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate single-source
shortest paths with amortized update time of $2^{\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log n})}$,
when $0&lt; \epsilon&lt;1$ is a constant and $|E|= n2^{\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{\log
n})}$. This improves over the best known update time of
$2^{\tilde{O}(\log^{3/4} n)}$
</p>
<p>by [Henzinger, Krinninger and Nanongkai, FOCS'14].
</p>
<p>Furthermore, for any integer $k \geq 1$ we give an algorithm for maintaining
$(2k-1)(1+\epsilon)$-approximate all-pairs-shortest-paths, in
$\tilde{O}(mn^{1/k})$ total update time and $O(k)$ query
time\footnote{Throughout this paper we use the notation $\tilde{O}(f(n))$ to
hide factors of $O(\text{polylog } (f(n)))$.}.
</p>
<p>This improves over the result of [Chechik, FOCS'18] in a twofold way. Namely,
we improve the total update time bound by removing an $n^{o(1)}$ factor and
reduce the query time from $O(\log \log (nW))$ to $O(k)$.
</p>
<p>Our results are based on a new decremental hopset construction that may be of
independent interest.

hypotheses that are just slightly better than random) into a strong learner
(which generates hypotheses that are much better than random). Recently,
Arunachalam and Maity gave the first quantum improvement for boosting, by
combining Freund and Schapire's AdaBoost algorithm with a quantum algorithm for
approximate counting. Their booster is faster than classical boosting as a
function of the VC-dimension of the weak learner's hypothesis class, but worse
as a function of the quality of the weak learner. In this paper we give a
substantially faster and simpler quantum boosting algorithm, based on
Servedio's SmoothBoost algorithm.

coloring that asks whether an input graph $G$ admits a homomorphism to the
undirected graph $H$ (possibly with loops), such that each vertex $v \in V(G)$
is mapped to a vertex on its list $L(v) \subseteq V(H)$. An important result by
Feder, Hell, and Huang [JGT 2003] states that List $H$-Coloring is
polynomial-time solvable if $H$ is a so-called bi-arc graph, and NP-complete
otherwise. We investigate the NP-complete cases of the problem from the
perspective of polynomial-time sparsification: can an $n$-vertex instance be
efficiently reduced to an equivalent instance of bitsize $O(n^{2-\varepsilon})$
for some $\varepsilon &gt; 0$? We prove that if $H$ is not a bi-arc graph, then
List $H$-Coloring does not admit such a sparsification algorithm unless $NP
\subseteq coNP/poly$. Our proofs combine techniques from kernelization lower
bounds with a study of the structure of graphs $H$ which are not bi-arc graphs.

this task can be accomplished by applying a Johnson-Lindenstrauss embedding and
subsequently binarizing each vector by comparing each entry of the vector to a
uniformly random threshold. Using this simple construction we produce two
encodings of a dataset such that one can query Euclidean information for a pair
of points using a small number of bit operations up to a desired additive error
- Euclidean distances in the first case and inner products and squared
Euclidean distances in the second. In the latter case, each point is encoded in
near-linear time. The number of bits required for these encodings is quantified
in terms of two natural complexity parameters of the dataset - its covering
numbers and localized Gaussian complexity - and shown to be near-optimal.

geometry, has become a subject of great interest in the area of surface
parameterization in recent decades with various applications in science and
engineering. However, most of the existing conformal parameterization
algorithms only focus on simply-connected surfaces and cannot be directly
applied to surfaces with holes. In this work, we propose two novel algorithms
for computing the conformal parameterization of multiply-connected surfaces. We
first develop an efficient method for conformally parameterizing an open
surface with one hole to an annulus on the plane. Based on this method, we then
develop an efficient method for conformally parameterizing an open surface with
$k$ holes onto a unit disk with $k$ circular holes. The conformality and
bijectivity of the mappings are ensured by quasi-conformal theory. Numerical
experiments and applications are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed methods.

systems (MSS) problem where the feasible region can be transformed between
requests. In this problem, which we call T-MSS, an algorithm maintains a point
in a metric space and has to serve a sequence of requests. Each request is a
map (transformation) $f_t\colon A_t\to B_t$ between subsets $A_t$ and $B_t$ of
the metric space. To serve it, the algorithm has to go to a point $a_t\in A_t$,
paying the distance from its previous position. Then, the transformation is
applied, modifying the algorithm's state to $f_t(a_t)$. Such transformations
can model, e.g., changes to the environment that are outside of an algorithm's
control, and we therefore do not charge any additional cost to the algorithm
when the transformation is applied. The transformations also allow to model
requests occurring in the $k$-taxi problem.
</p>
<p>We show that for $\alpha$-Lipschitz transformations, the competitive ratio is
$\Theta(\alpha)^{n-2}$ on $n$-point metrics. Here, the upper bound is achieved
by a deterministic algorithm and the lower bound holds even for randomized
algorithms. For the $k$-taxi problem, we prove a competitive ratio of $\tilde
O((n\log k)^2)$. For chasing convex bodies, we show that even with contracting
transformations no competitive algorithm exists.
</p>
<p>The problem T-MSS has a striking connection to the following deep
mathematical question: Given a finite metric space $M$, what is the required
cardinality of an extension $\hat M\supseteq M$ where each partial isometry on
$M$ extends to an automorphism? We give partial answers for special cases.

solution for numerous quantum information processing tasks. This motivates the
design of robust tomography procedures that use relevant resources as sparingly
as possible. Important cost factors include the number of state copies and
measurement settings, as well as classical postprocessing time and memory. In
this work, we present and analyze an online tomography algorithm that is
designed to optimize all the aforementioned resources at the cost of a worse
dependence on accuracy. The protocol is the first to give optimal performance
in terms of rank and dimension for state copies, measurement settings and
memory. Classical runtime is also reduced substantially. Further improvements
are possible by executing the algorithm on a quantum computer, giving a quantum
speedup for quantum state tomography.

highly dynamic distributed networks - networks which allow an arbitrary number
of links to be inserted / deleted per round. We show that the problems of
$k$-clique membership listing (for any $k\geq 3$), 4-cycle listing and 5-cycle
listing can be deterministically solved in $O(1)$-amortized round complexity,
even with limited logarithmic-sized messages.
</p>
<p>To achieve $k$-clique membership listing we introduce a very useful
combinatorial structure which we name the robust $2$-hop neighborhood. This is
a subset of the 2-hop neighborhood of a node, and we prove that it can be
maintained in highly dynamic networks in $O(1)$-amortized rounds. We also show
that maintaining the actual 2-hop neighborhood of a node requires near linear
amortized time, showing the necessity of our definition. For $4$-cycle and
$5$-cycle listing, we need edges within hop distance 3, for which we similarly
define the robust $3$-hop neighborhood and prove it can be maintained in highly
dynamic networks in $O(1)$-amortized rounds.
</p>
<p>We complement the above with several impossibility results. We show that
membership listing of any other graph on $k\geq 3$ nodes except $k$-clique
requires an almost linear number of amortized communication rounds. We also
show that $k$-cycle listing for $k\geq 6$ requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n} / \log n)$
amortized rounds. This, combined with our upper bounds, paints a detailed
picture of the complexity landscape for ultra fast graph finding algorithms in
this highly dynamic environment.

VertexCover (VC) problem: the $p$-Edge-Connected and $p$-Vertex-Connected VC
problem (where $p \geq 2$ is a fixed integer). Like Connected VC, both new VC
problems are FPT, but do not admit a polynomial kernel unless $NP \subseteq
coNP/poly$, which is highly unlikely. We prove however that both problems admit
time efficient polynomial sized approximate kernelization schemes. We obtain an
$O(2^{O(pk)}n^{O(1)})$-time algorithm for the $p$-Edge-Connected VC and an
$O(2^{O(k^2)}n^{O(1)})$-time algorithm for the $p$-Vertex-Connected VC.
Finally, we describe a $2(p+1)$-approximation algorithm for the
$p$-Edge-Connected VC. The proofs for the new VC problems require more
sophisticated arguments than for Connected VC. In particular, for the
approximation algorithm we use Gomory-Hu trees and for the approximate kernels
a result on small-size spanning $p$-vertex/edge-connected subgraph of a
$p$-vertex/edge-connected graph obtained independently by Nishizeki and Poljak
(1994) and Nagamochi and Ibaraki (1992).

instances of all Boolean constraint satisfaction problems. The number of
constraints required by our algorithm matches (up to polylogarithmic factors)
the best-known bounds for efficient refutation of fully random instances. Our
main technical contribution is an algorithm to strongly refute semi-random
instances of the Boolean $k$-XOR problem on $n$ variables that have
$\widetilde{O}(n^{k/2})$ constraints. (In a semi-random $k$-XOR instance, the
equations can be arbitrary and only the right-hand sides are random.)
</p>
<p>One of our key insights is to identify a simple combinatorial property of
random XOR instances that makes spectral refutation work. Our approach involves
taking an instance that does not satisfy this property (i.e., is \emph{not}
pseudorandom) and reducing it to a partitioned collection of $2$-XOR instances.
We analyze these subinstances using a carefully chosen quadratic form as a
proxy, which in turn is bounded via a combination of spectral methods and
semidefinite programming. The analysis of our spectral bounds relies only on an
off-the-shelf matrix Bernstein inequality. Even for the purely random case,
this leads to a shorter proof compared to the ones in the literature that rely
on problem-specific trace-moment computations.

terrain creating floods by forming channels and filling depressions. In this
paper we study a number of \emph{flow-query} related problems: Given a terrain
$\Sigma$, represented as a triangulated $xy$-monotone surface with $n$
vertices, a rain distribution $R$ which may vary over time, determine how much
water is flowing over a given edge as a function of time. We develop
internal-memory as well as I/O-efficient algorithms for flow queries.
</p>
<p>This paper contains four main results:
</p>
<p>(i) We present an internal-memory algorithm that preprocesses $\Sigma$ into a
linear-size data structure that for a (possibly time varying) rain distribution
$R$ can return the flow-rate functions of all edges of $\Sigma$ in $O(\rho
k+|\phi| \log n)$ time, where $\rho$ is the number of sinks in $\Sigma$, $k$ is
the number of times the rain distribution changes, and $|\phi|$ is the total
complexity of the flow-rate functions that have non-zero values;
</p>
<p>(ii) We also present an I/O-efficient algorithm for preprocessing $\Sigma$
into a linear-size data structure so that for a rain distribution $R$, it can
compute the flow-rate function of all edges using $O(\text{Sort}(|\phi|))$ I/Os
and $O(|\phi| \log |\phi|)$ internal computation time.
</p>
<p>(iii) $\Sigma$ can be preprocessed into a linear-size data structure so that
for a given rain distribution $R$, the flow-rate function of an edge $(q,r) \in
\Sigma$ under the single-flow direction (SFD) model can be computed more
efficiently.
</p>
<p>(iv) We present an algorithm for computing the two-dimensional channel along
which water flows using Manning's equation; a widely used empirical equation
that relates the flow-rate of water in an open channel to the geometry of the
channel along with the height of water in the channel.

differential privacy that eliminate the need for a fully trusted central data
collector, but overcome the limitations of local differential privacy. This
interest has led to the introduction of the shuffle model (Cheu et al.,
EUROCRYPT 2019; Erlingsson et al., SODA 2019) and revisiting the pan-private
model (Dwork et al., ITCS 2010). The message of this line of work is that, for
a variety of low-dimensional problems---such as counts, means, and
histograms---these intermediate models offer nearly as much power as central
differential privacy. However, there has been considerably less success using
these models for high-dimensional learning and estimation problems.
</p>
<p>In this work, we show that, for a variety of high-dimensional learning and
estimation problems, both the shuffle model and the pan-private model
inherently incur an exponential price in sample complexity relative to the
central model. For example, we show that, private agnostic learning of parity
functions over $d$ bits requires $\Omega(2^{d/2})$ samples in these models, and
privately selecting the most common attribute from a set of $d$ choices
requires $\Omega(d^{1/2})$ samples, both of which are exponential separations
from the central model. Our work gives the first non-trivial lower bounds for
these problems for both the pan-private model and the general multi-message
shuffle model.

items, parcels) with different origin and destination pairs travel in one
resource. In recent years, online multi-capacity ridesharing services (i.e.,
where assignments are made online) like Uber-pool, foodpanda, and on-demand
shuttles have become hugely popular in transportation, food delivery, logistics
and other domains. This is because multi-capacity ridesharing services benefit
all parties involved { the customers (due to lower costs), the drivers (due to
higher revenues) and the matching platforms (due to higher revenues per
vehicle/resource). Most importantly these services can also help reduce carbon
emissions (due to fewer vehicles on roads).
</p>
<p>Online multi-capacity ridesharing is extremely challenging as the underlying
matching graph is no longer bipartite (as in the unit-capacity case) but a
tripartite graph with resources (e.g., taxis, cars), requests and request
groups (combinations of requests that can travel together). The desired
matching between resources and request groups is constrained by the edges
between requests and request groups in this tripartite graph (i.e., a request
can be part of at most one request group in the final assignment). While there
have been myopic heuristic approaches employed for solving the online
multi-capacity ridesharing problem, they do not provide any guarantees on the
solution quality. To that end, this paper presents the first approach with
bounds on the competitive ratio for online multi-capacity ridesharing (when
resources rejoin the system at their initial location/depot after serving a
group of requests).

rephrased in terms of coined quantum walks with effective nonlinear phase,
display a strong computational advantage for search algorithms, over graphs
having sets of vertices of constant size, e.g. the infinite square grid. The
numerical simulations show that the walker finds the marked vertex in
$O(N^{1/4} \log^{3/4} N)$ steps with probability $O(1/\log N)$, for an overall
complexity of $O(N^{1/4}\log^{7/4}N)$. We also confirm this result
analytically. Moreover the algorithm is implemented without the need for a
specific oracle step, but by topological hole defect in the grid. From a
quantum computing perspective, however, this hints at novel applications of
quantum walk search: instead of using them to look for "good" solutions within
the configuration space of a problem, we could use them to look for topological
properties of the entire configuration space.

of today's best algorithms and solvers for mixed integer programming and
pseudo-boolean optimization to achieve peak solving performance. Irregularities
in the form of dynamic algorithmic behaviour, dependency structures, and
sparsity patterns in the input data make efficient implementations of domain
propagation on GPUs and, more generally, on parallel architectures challenging.
This is one of the main reasons why domain propagation in state-of-the-art
solvers is single thread only. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for
domain propagation which (a) avoids these problems and allows for an efficient
implementation on GPUs, and is (b) capable of running propagation rounds
entirely on the GPU, without any need for synchronization or communication with
the CPU. We present extensive computational results which demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach and show that ample speedups are possible on
practically relevant problems: on state-of-the-art GPUs, our geometric mean
speed-up for reasonably-large instances is around 10x to 20x and can be as high
as 195x on favorably-large instances.

probabilistic accuracy guarantees. For a property P, the goal is to distinguish
inputs that have P from those that are far from having P with high probability
correctly, by querying only a small number of local parts of the input. In
property testing on graphs, the distance is measured by the number of edge
modifications (additions or deletions), that are necessary to transform a graph
into one with property P. Much research has focussed on the query complexity of
such algorithms, i. e. the number of queries the algorithm makes to the input,
but in view of applications, the running time of the algorithm is equally
relevant.
</p>
<p>In (Adler, Harwath STACS 2018), a natural extension of the bounded degree
graph model of property testing to relational databases of bounded degree was
introduced, and it was shown that on databases of bounded degree and bounded
tree-width, every property that is expressible in monadic second-order logic
with counting (CMSO) is testable with constant query complexity and sublinear
running time. It remains open whether this can be improved to constant running
time.
</p>
<p>In this paper we introduce a new model, which is based on the bounded degree
model, but the distance measure allows both edge (tuple) modifications and
vertex (element) modifications. Our main theorem shows that on databases of
bounded degree and bounded tree-width, every property that is expressible in
CMSO is testable with constant query complexity and constant running time in
the new model. We also show that every property that is testable in the
classical model is testable in our model with the same query complexity and
running time, but the converse is not true.
</p>
<p>We argue that our model is natural and our meta-theorem showing constant-time
CMSO testability supports this.

efficient parallelization in many applications. In this work, we are concerned
with a spatial partitioning called rectilinear partitioning (also known as
generalized block distribution) of sparse matrices. More specifically, in this
work, we address the problem of symmetric rectilinear partitioning of a square
matrix. By symmetric, we mean the rows and columns of the matrix are
identically partitioned yielding a tiling where the diagonal tiles (blocks)
will be squares. We first show that the optimal solution to this problem is
NP-hard, and we propose four heuristics to solve two different variants of this
problem. We present a thorough analysis of the computational complexities of
those proposed heuristics. To make the proposed techniques more applicable in
real life application scenarios, we further reduce their computational
complexities by utilizing effective sparsification strategies together with an
efficient sparse prefix-sum data structure. We experimentally show the proposed
algorithms are efficient and effective on more than six hundred test matrices.
With sparsification, our methods take less than 3 seconds in the Twitter graph
on a modern 24 core system and output a solution whose load imbalance is no
worse than 1%.

(confocal pair) is the image under a variable similarity transform of poristic
triangles (those with non-concentric, fixed incircle and circumcircle). Both
families conserve the ratio of inradius to circumradius and therefore also the
sum of cosines. This is consisten with the fact that a similarity preserves
angles. Here we study two new Poncelet 3-periodic families also tied to each
other via a variable similarity: (i) a first one interscribed in a pair of
concentric, homothetic ellipses, and (ii) a second non-concentric one known as
the Brocard porism: fixed circumcircle and Brocard inellipse. The Brocard
points of this family are stationary at the foci of the inellipse. A key common
invariant is the Brocard angle, and therefore the sum of cotangents. This
raises an interesting question: given a non-concentric Poncelet family (limited
or not to the outer conic being a circle), can a similar doppelg\"anger always
be found interscribed in a concentric, axis-aligned ellipse and/or conic pair?

\Sigma^n$ that admit a local decoding algorithm that recovers each individual
bit of the message by querying only a few bits from a noisy codeword. An
important question in this line of research is to understand the optimal
trade-off between the query complexity of LDCs and their block length. Despite
importance of these objects, the best known constructions of constant query
LDCs have super-polynomial length, and there is a significant gap between the
best constructions and the known lower bounds in terms of the block length.
</p>
<p>For many applications it suffices to consider the weaker notion of relaxed
LDCs (RLDCs), which allows the local decoding algorithm to abort if by querying
a few bits it detects that the input is not a codeword. This relaxation turned
out to allow decoding algorithms with constant query complexity for codes with
almost linear length. Specifically, [BGH+06] constructed an $O(q)$-query RLDC
that encodes a message of length $k$ using a codeword of block length $n =
O(k^{1+1/\sqrt{q}})$.
</p>
<p>In this work we improve the parameters of [BGH+06] by constructing an
$O(q)$-query RLDC that encodes a message of length $k$ using a codeword of
block length $O(k^{1+1/{q}})$. This construction matches (up to a
multiplicative constant factor) the lower bounds of [KT00, Woo07] for constant
query LDCs, thus making progress toward understanding the gap between LDCs and
RLDCs in the constant query regime.
</p>
<p>In fact, our construction extends to the stronger notion of relaxed locally
correctable codes (RLCCs), introduced in [GRR18], where given a noisy codeword
the correcting algorithm either recovers each individual bit of the codeword by
only reading a small part of the input, or aborts if the input is detected to
be corrupt.

<p>The study of differentially private PAC learning runs all the way from
its introduction in 2008 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0924" title="Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan, Homin K. Lee, Kobbi Nissim, Sofya Raskhodnikova, and Adam Smith. What Can We Learn Privately? FOCS 2008"><strong>[KLNRS08]</strong></a> to a best paper award at the
Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) this year <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00563" title="Mark Bun, Roi Livni, and Shay Moran. An equivalence between private classification and online prediction. FOCS 2020"><strong>[BLM20]</strong></a>.
In this post, we’ll recap the history of this line of work, aiming for
enough detail for a rough understanding of the results and methods.</p>

<p>Before we get to the “what” and “how” of private PAC learning, it’s
worth thinking about the “why”. One motivation for this line of work is
that it neatly captures a fundamental question: does privacy in machine
learning come at a price? Machine learning is now sufficiently
successful and widespread for this question to have real import. But to
even start to address this question, we need a formalization of machine
learning that allows us to reason about possible trade-offs in a
rigorous way. Statistical learning theory, and its computational
formalization as PAC learning, provide one such clean and well-studied
model. We can therefore use PAC learning as a testbed whose insights we
might carry to other less idealized forms of learning.</p>

<p>With this motivation in mind, the rest of this post is structured as
follows. The first section covers the basics of the PAC model, and
subsequent sections gradually build up a chronology of results. When
possible, we give short sketches of the accompanying techniques.</p>

<h1 id="pac-learning">PAC Learning</h1>

<p>We’ll start with a brief overview of PAC learning absent any privacy
restrictions. Readers familiar with PAC learning can probably skip this
section while noting that</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>(the cardinality version of) Occam’s razor is a baseline learner
using \(O(\log|\mathcal{H}|)\) samples,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>VC dimension characterizes non-private PAC learning,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we’ll focus on the sample complexity of realizable PAC learning,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we’ll usually omit dependencies on accuracy and success probability
parameters, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we’ll usually ignore computational efficiency.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>For readers needing a refresher on PAC learning, the basic element of
the “probably approximately correct” (PAC) framework <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1968.1972" title="Leslie G Valiant. A theory of the learnable. Communications of the ACM, 1984"><strong>[Val84]</strong></a> is a
<em>hypothesis</em>. Each hypothesis is a function
\(h \colon \mathcal{X}\to \{-1,1\}\) mapping <em>examples</em> from some space
\(\mathcal{X}\) to binary labels. A collection of hypotheses is a
<em>hypothesis class</em> \(\mathcal{H}\), e.g., thresholds (a.k.a. perceptrons),
rectangles, conjunctions, and so on. In the <em>realizable</em> setting, a
learner receives examples drawn from some unknown distribution and
labeled by an unknown \(h^\ast \in \mathcal{H}\). The learner’s goal is to
with high probability (“probably”) output a hypothesis that mostly
matches the labels of \(h^\ast\) on future examples from the unknown example
distribution (“approximately correct”). In the <em>agnostic</em> setting,
examples are not necessarily labeled by any \(h
\in \mathcal{H}\), and the goal is only to output a hypothesis that
approximates the best error of any hypothesis from \(\mathcal{H}\). As
mentioned above, we focus on the realizable setting unless otherwise
specified. In the <em>proper</em> setting, the learner must output a hypothesis
from \(\mathcal{H}\) itself. In the <em>improper</em> setting, this requirement
is removed.</p>

<p>In general, we say an algorithm \((\alpha,\beta)\)-PAC learns
\(\mathcal{H}\) with sample complexity \(n\) if \(n\) samples are sufficient
to with probability at least \(1-\beta\) obtain error at most \(\alpha\)
over new examples from the distribution. For the purposes of this post,
we generally omit these dependencies on \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), as they
typically vary little or not at all when switching between non-private
and private PAC learning.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we always have a simple baseline learner based on empirical
risk minimization: given a set of labeled examples, iterate over all
hypotheses \(h \in \mathcal{H}\), check how many of the labeled examples
each \(h\) mislabels, and output a hypothesis that mislabels the fewest
examples. Using this learner, which is sometimes called “Occam’s razor,”
\(O(\log|\mathcal{H}|)\) samples suffice to PAC learn \(\mathcal{H}\).</p>

<p>At the same time, \(|\mathcal{H}|\) is a pretty coarse measure of
hypothesis class complexity, as it would immediately rule out learning
any infinite hypothesis class (of which there are many). Thus, as you
might expect, we can do better. We do so using <em>VC dimension</em>.
\(\mathsf{VCD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)\) is the size of the largest
possible collection of examples such that, for every labeling of the
examples, \(\mathcal{H}\) contains a hypothesis with that labeling. With
VC dimension, we can essentially swap \(\log|\mathcal{H}|\) with
\(\mathsf{VCD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)\) in the Occam’s razor bound and
PAC learn with \(O(\mathsf{VCD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right))\) samples. In
fact, the “Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning” says that PAC
learnability (realizable or agnostic) is equivalent to finite VC
dimension. In this sense, \(\mathsf{VCD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)\) is a
good measure of how hard it is to PAC learn \(\mathcal{H}\). As a
motivating example that will re-appear later, note that for the
hypothesis class of 1-dimensional thresholds over \(T\) points,
\(\log |\mathcal{H}| = \log T\), while
\(\mathsf{VCD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)\) is only 1.</p>

<p><img width="400" style="margin: auto; display: block;" alt="Example: a one-dimensional threshold function" src="https://differentialprivacy.org/images/thresh.png" />
An illustration of 1-dimensional thresholds. A given threshold is determined by some point \(x^\ast \in [T]\): any example \(x \leq x^\ast\) receives label \(-1\), and any example \(x &gt; x^\ast\) receives label 1.</p>

<h1 id="a-simple-private-pac-learner">A Simple Private PAC Learner</h1>

<p>It is straightforward to add a differential privacy constraint to the
PAC framework: the hypothesis output by the learner must be a
differentially private function of the labeled examples
\((x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)\). That is, changing any one of the
examples — even to one with an inconsistent label — must not affect
the distribution over hypotheses output by the learner by too much.</p>

<p>Since we haven’t talked about any other PAC learner, we may as well
start with the empirical risk minimization-style Occam’s razor discussed
in the previous section, which simply selects a hypothesis that
minimizes empirical error. A private version becomes easy if we view
this algorithm in the right light. All it is doing is assigning a score
to each possible output (the hypothesis’ empirical error) and outputting
one with the best (lowest) score. This makes it a good candidate for
privatization by the <em>exponential mechanism</em> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/FOCS.2007.41" title="Frank McSherry, Kunal Talwar. Mechanism Design via Differential Privacy. FOCS 2007."><strong>[MT07]</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Recall that the exponential mechanism uses a scoring function over
outputs to release better outputs with higher probability, subject to
the privacy constraint. More formally, the exponential mechanism
requires a scoring function \(u(X,h)\) mapping (database, output) pairs to
real-valued scores and then selects a given output \(h\) with probability
proportional to \(\exp\left(\tfrac{\varepsilon
u(X,h)}{2\Delta(u)}\right)\). Thus a lower \(\varepsilon\) (stricter
privacy requirement) and larger \(\Delta(u) := \sup_h \sup_{X \sim X’} u(X,h) - u(X’,h) \) (scoring function more sensitive to changing one element in the database \(X\) to make \(X’\)) both lead to a more uniform (more
private) output distribution.</p>

<p>Fortunately for our PAC learning setting, empirical error is not a very
sensitive scoring function: changing one sample only changes empirical
error by 1. We can therefore use (negative) empirical error as our
scoring function \(u(X,h)\), apply the exponential mechanism, and get a
“private Occam’s razor.” This was exactly what Kasiviswanathan, Lee,
Nissim, Raskhodnikova, and Smith <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0924" title="Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan, Homin K. Lee, Kobbi Nissim, Sofya Raskhodnikova, and Adam Smith. What Can We Learn Privately? FOCS 2008"><strong>[KLNRS08]</strong></a> did when they introduced
differentially private PAC learning in 2008. The resulting sample
complexity bounds differ from the generic Occam’s razor only by an
\(\varepsilon\) factor in the denominator, and
\(O(\log|\mathcal{H}|/\varepsilon)\) samples suffice to privately PAC
learn \(\mathcal{H}\).</p>

<p>Of course, our experience with non-private PAC learning suggests that we
shouldn’t be satisfied with this \(\log
|\mathcal{H}|\) dependence. Maybe VC dimension characterizes private PAC
learning, too?</p>

<h1 id="characterizing-pure-private-pac-learning">Characterizing Pure Private PAC Learning</h1>

<p>As it turns out, answering this question will take some time. We start
with a partial negative answer. Specifically, we’ll see a class with VC
dimension 1 and (a restricted form of) private sample complexity
arbitrarily larger than 1. We’ll also cover the first in a line of
characterization results for private PAC learning.</p>

<p>We first consider learners that satisfy <em>pure</em> privacy. Recall that pure
\((\varepsilon,0)\)-differential privacy forces output distributions that
may only differ by a certain \(e^\varepsilon\) multiplicative factor (like
the exponential mechanism above). The strictly weaker notion of
approximate \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-differential privacy also allows a
small additive \(\delta\) factor. Second, we restrict ourselves to
<em>proper</em> learners, which may only output hypotheses from the learned
class \(\mathcal{H}\).</p>

<p>With these assumptions in place, in 2010, Beimel, Kasiviswanathan, and
Nissim <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-642-11799-2_26" title="Amos Beimel, Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan, and Kobbi Nissim. Bounds on the sample complexity for private learning and private data release. TCC 2010"><strong>[BKN10]</strong></a> studied a hypothesis class called \(\mathsf{Point}_d\).
\(\mathsf{Point}_d\) consists of \(2^d\) hypotheses, one for each vector in
\(\{0,1\}^d\). Taking the set of examples \(\mathcal{X}\) to be \(\{0,1\}^d\)
as well, we define each hypothesis in \(\mathsf{Point}_d\) to label only
its associated vector as 1, and the remaining \(2^d-1\) examples as
-1. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-642-11799-2_26" title="Amos Beimel, Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan, and Kobbi Nissim. Bounds on the sample complexity for private learning and private data release. TCC 2010"><strong>[BKN10]</strong></a> showed that the hypothesis class \(\mathsf{Point}_d\) requires
\(\Omega(d)\) samples for proper pure private PAC learning. In contrast,
\(\mathsf{VCD}\left(\mathsf{Point}_d\right) = 1\), so this \(\Omega(d)\)
lower bound shows us that VC dimension does <em>not</em> characterize proper
pure private PAC learning.</p>

<p>This result uses the classic “packing” lower bound method, which powers
many lower bounds for pure differential privacy. The general packing
method is to first construct a large collection of databases which are
all “close enough” to each other but nonetheless all have different
“good” outputs. Once we have such a collection, we use <em>group privacy</em>.
Group privacy is a corollary of differential privacy that requires
databases differing in \(k\) elements to have \(k\varepsilon\)-close output
distributions. Because of group privacy, if we start with a collection
of databases that are close together, then the output distributions for
any two databases in the collection cannot be too different. This
creates a tension: utility forces the algorithm to produce different
output distributions for different databases, but privacy forces
similarity. The packing argument comes down to arguing that, unless the
databases are large, privacy wins out, and when privacy wins out then
there is some database where the algorithm probably produces a bad
output.</p>

<p>For \(\mathsf{Point}_d\), we sketch the resulting argument as follows.
Suppose we have an \(\varepsilon\)-private PAC learner that uses \(m\)
samples. Then we can define a collection of different databases of size
\(m\), one for each hypothesis in \(\mathsf{Point}_d\). By group privacy,
the output distribution for our private PAC learner changes by at most
\(e^{m\varepsilon}\) between any two of the databases in this collection.
Thus we can pick any \(h \in \mathsf{Point}_d\) and know that the
probability of outputting the wrong hypothesis is at least roughly
\(2^d \cdot e^{-m\varepsilon}\). Since we need this probability to be
small, rearranging implies \(m =
\Omega(d/\varepsilon)\).</p>

<p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-642-11799-2_26" title="Amos Beimel, Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan, and Kobbi Nissim. Bounds on the sample complexity for private learning and private data release. TCC 2010"><strong>[BKN10]</strong></a> then contrasted this result with an <em>improper</em> pure private PAC
learner. This learner applies the exponential mechanism to a class
\(\mathsf{Point}_d’\) of hypotheses derived from \(\mathsf{Point}_d\) —
but <em>not</em> necessarily a subset of \(\mathsf{Point}_d\) — gives an
improper pure private PAC learner with sample complexity \(O(\log
d)\). Since this learner is improper, it circumvents the “one database
per hypothesis” step of the packing lower bound. Moreover, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-642-11799-2_26" title="Amos Beimel, Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan, and Kobbi Nissim. Bounds on the sample complexity for private learning and private data release. TCC 2010"><strong>[BKN10]</strong></a> gave a
still more involved improper pure private PAC learner requiring only
\(O(1)\) samples. This separates proper pure private PAC learning from
improper pure private PAC learning. In contrast, the sample complexities
of proper and improper PAC learning absent privacy are the same up to
logarithmic factors in \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\).</p>

<p>In 2013, Beimel, Nissim, and Stemmer <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2224" title="Amos Beimel, Kobbi Nissim, and Uri Stemmer. Characterizing the sample complexity of private learners. ITCS 2013"><strong>[BNS13]</strong></a> proved a more general
result. They gave the first characterization of pure (improper) private
PAC learning by defining a new hypothesis class measure called the
<em>representation dimension</em>, \(\mathsf{REPD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)\).
Roughly, the representation dimension considers the collection of all
distributions \(\mathcal{D}\) over sets of hypotheses, not necessarily
from \(\mathcal{H}\), that “cover” \(\mathcal{H}\). By “cover,” we mean that
for any \(h
\in \mathcal{H}\), with high probability a set drawn from covering
distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) includes a hypothesis that mostly produces
labels that agree with \(h\). With this collection of distributions
defined, \(\mathsf{REPD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)\) is the minimum over all
such covering distributions of the logarithm of the size of the largest
set in its support. Thus a hypothesis class that can be covered by a
distribution over small sets of hypotheses will have a small
representation dimension. With the notion of representation dimension in
hand, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2224" title="Amos Beimel, Kobbi Nissim, and Uri Stemmer. Characterizing the sample complexity of private learners. ITCS 2013"><strong>[BNS13]</strong></a> gave the following result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 1</strong> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2224" title="Amos Beimel, Kobbi Nissim, and Uri Stemmer. Characterizing the sample complexity of private learners. ITCS 2013"><strong>[BNS13]</strong></a>). The sample complexity to pure private PAC learn \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\Theta(\mathsf{REPD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right))\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Representation dimension may seem like a strange definition, but a
sketch of the proof of this result helps illustrate the connection to
private learning. Recall from our private Occam’s razor, and the
improper pure private PAC learner above, that if we can find a good and
relatively small set of hypotheses to choose from, then we can apply the
exponential mechanism and call it a day. It is exactly this kind of
“good set of hypotheses” that representation dimension aims to capture.
A little more formally, given an upper bound on
\(\mathsf{REPD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)\), we know there is some covering
distribution whose largest hypothesis set is not too big. That means we
can construct a learner that draws a hypothesis set from this covering
distribution and applies the exponential mechanism to it. Just as we
picked up a \(\log|\mathcal{H}|\) sample complexity dependence using
private Occam’s razor, since \(\mathsf{REPD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)\)
measures the logarithm of the size of the largest hypothesis set in the
support, this pure private learner picks up a
\(\mathsf{REPD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)\) sample complexity dependence
here. This gives us one direction of
Theorem 1.</p>

<p>This logic works in the other direction as well. To go from a pure
private PAC learner with sample complexity \(m\) to an upper bound on
\(\mathsf{REPD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)\), we return to the group privacy
trick used by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-642-11799-2_26" title="Amos Beimel, Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan, and Kobbi Nissim. Bounds on the sample complexity for private learning and private data release. TCC 2010"><strong>[BKN10]</strong></a>. Suppose we fix a database of size \(m\) and pass it
to the learner. By group privacy and the learner’s accuracy guarantee,
if we fix some concept \(c\), the learner has probability at least roughly
\(e^{-m}\) of outputting a hypothesis that mostly agrees with \(c\). Thus if
we repeat this process roughly \(e^{m}\) times, we probably get at least
one hypothesis that mostly agrees with \(c\). In other words, this
repeated calling of the learner on the arbitrary database yields a
covering distribution for \(\mathcal{H}\). Since we called the learner
approximately \(e^m\) times, the logarithm of this is \(m\), and we get our
upper bound on \(\mathsf{REPD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)\).</p>

<p>To recap, we now know that proper pure private PAC learning is strictly
harder than improper pure private PAC learning, which is characterized
by representation dimension. A picture sums it up. Note the dotted line,
since we don’t yet have any evidence separating finite representation
dimension and finite VC dimension.</p>

<h1 id="separating-pure-and-approximate-private-pac-learning">Separating Pure and Approximate Private PAC Learning</h1>

<p>So far, we’ve focused only on pure privacy. In this section, we move on
to the first separations between pure and approximate private PAC
learning, as well as the first connection between private learning and
<em>online</em> learning.</p>

<p>Our source is a pair of interconnected papers from around 2014. Among
other things, Feldman and Xiao <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6278" title="Vitaly Feldman and David Xiao. Sample complexity bounds on differentially private learning via communication complexity. COLT 2014"><strong>[FX14]</strong></a> introduced <em>Littlestone
dimension</em> to private PAC learning. By connecting representation
dimension to results from communication complexity to Littlestone
dimension, they proved the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 2</strong> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6278" title="Vitaly Feldman and David Xiao. Sample complexity bounds on differentially private learning via communication complexity. COLT 2014"><strong>[FX14]</strong></a>). The sample complexity to pure private PAC learn \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\Omega(\mathsf{LD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right))\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Littlestone dimension \(\mathsf{LD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)\) is, roughly,
the maximum number of mistakes an adversary can force an <em>online</em>
PAC-learning algorithm to make <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1022869011914" title="Nick Littlestone. Learning quickly when irrelevant attributes abound: A new linear-threshold algorithm. Machine learning, 1988"><strong>[Lit88]</strong></a>. We always have
\(\mathsf{VCD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right) \leq \mathsf{LD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right) \leq \log|\mathcal{H}|\),
but these inequalities can be strict. For example, denoting by
\(\mathsf{Thresh_T}\) the class of thresholds over \(\{1, 2, \ldots,
T\}\), since an adversary can force \(\Theta(\log T)\) wrong answers from
an online learner binary searching over \(\{1,2, \ldots, T\}\),
\(\mathsf{LD}\left(\mathsf{Thresh_T}\right) = \Omega(\log T)\). In
contrast, \(\mathsf{VCD}\left(\mathsf{Thresh_T}\right) = 1\).</p>

<p>At first glance it’s not obvious what
Theorem 2 adds over
Theorem 1. After all,
Theorem 1 gives an equivalence, not just a lower bound. One
advantage of
Theorem 2 is that Littlestone dimension is a known
quantity that has already been studied in its own right. We can now
import results like the lower bound on
\(\mathsf{LD}\left(\mathsf{Thresh_T}\right)\), whereas bounds on
\(\mathsf{REPD}\left(\cdot\right)\) are not common. A second advantage is
that Littlestone dimension conceptually connects private learning and
online learning: we now know that pure private PAC learning is no easier
than online PAC learning.</p>

<p>A second paper by Beimel, Nissim, and Stemmer <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2674" title="Amos Beimel, Kobbi Nissim, and Uri Stemmer. Private learning and sanitization: Pure vs. approximate differential privacy. APPROX-RANDOM 2013"><strong>[BNS13b]</strong></a> contrasted this
\(\Omega(\log T)\) lower bound for pure private learning of thresholds
with a \(2^{O(\log^\ast T)}\) upper bound for <em>approximate</em> private PAC
learning \(\mathsf{Thresh_T}\). Here \(\log^\ast\) denotes the very
slow-growing iterated logarithm, the number of times we must take the
logarithm of the argument to bring it \(\leq 1\). (We’re not kidding about
“very slow-growing” either:
\(\log^\ast(\text{number of atoms in universe}) \approx
4\).) With Feldman and Xiao’s result, this separates pure private PAC
learning from approximate private PAC learning. It also shows that
representation dimension does <em>not</em> characterize approximate private PAC
learning.</p>

<p>At the same time, Feldman and Xiao observed that the connection between
pure private PAC learning and Littlestone dimension is imperfect. Again
borrowing results from communication complexity, they observed that the
hypothesis class \(\mathsf{Line_p}\) (which we won’t define here) has
\(\mathsf{LD}\left(\mathsf{Line_p}\right) = 2\) but
\(\mathsf{REPD}\left(\mathsf{Line_p}\right)
= \Theta(\log(p))\). In contrast, they showed that an <em>approximate</em>
private PAC learner can learn \(\mathsf{Line_p}\) using
\(O\left(\tfrac{\log(1/\beta)}{\alpha}\right)\) samples. Since this
entails no dependence on \(p\) at all, it improves the separation between
pure and approximate private PAC learning given by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2674" title="Amos Beimel, Kobbi Nissim, and Uri Stemmer. Private learning and sanitization: Pure vs. approximate differential privacy. APPROX-RANDOM 2013"><strong>[BNS13b]</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Let’s pause to recap what’s happened so far. We learned in the last
section that representation dimension characterizes pure private PAC
learning <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2224" title="Amos Beimel, Kobbi Nissim, and Uri Stemmer. Characterizing the sample complexity of private learners. ITCS 2013"><strong>[BNS13]</strong></a>. We learned in this section that Littlestone dimension
gives lower bounds for pure private PAC learning but, as shown by
\(\mathsf{Line_p}\), these bounds are sometimes quite loose <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6278" title="Vitaly Feldman and David Xiao. Sample complexity bounds on differentially private learning via communication complexity. COLT 2014"><strong>[FX14]</strong></a>.
\(\mathsf{Thresh_T}\) shows that representation dimension does not
characterize approximate private PAC learning <strong>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6278" title="Vitaly Feldman and David Xiao. Sample complexity bounds on differentially private learning via communication complexity. COLT 2014">FX14</a>
; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2674" title="Amos Beimel, Kobbi Nissim, and Uri Stemmer. Private learning and sanitization: Pure vs. approximate differential privacy. APPROX-RANDOM 2013">BNS13b</a>]</strong>, and we
still have no privacy-specific lower bounds for approximate private
learners. So the picture now looks like this:</p>

<p><img width="400" style="margin: auto; display: block;" alt="Landscape of Private PAC, take 2" src="https://differentialprivacy.org/images/private_pac_2.png" /></p>

<p>In particular, we might still find that VC dimension characterizes
approximate private PAC learning!</p>

<h1 id="lower-bounds-for-approximate-private-pac-learning">Lower Bounds for Approximate Private PAC Learning</h1>

<p>We now dash this hope. In 2015, Bun, Nissim, Stemmer, and
Vadhan <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07553" title="Mark Bun, Kobbi Nissim, Uri Stemmer, and Salil Vadhan. Differentially private release and learning of threshold functions. FOCS 2015"><strong>[BNSV15]</strong></a> gave the first nontrivial lower bound for approximate
private PAC learning. They showed that learning \(\mathsf{Thresh_T}\) has
<em>proper</em> approximate private sample complexity \(\Omega(\log^\ast(T))\) and
\(O(2^{\log^\ast(T)})\).</p>

<p>We’ll at least try to give some intuition for the presence of \(\log^\ast\)
in the lower bound. Informally, the lower bound relies on an inductive
construction of a sequence of hard problems for databases of size
\(n=1, 2,
\ldots\). The \(k^{th}\) hard problem relies on a distribution over
databases of size \(k\) whose data universe is of of size exponential in
the size of the data universe for the \((k-1)^{th}\) distribution. The
base case is the uniform distribution over the two singleton databases
\(\{0\}\) and \(\{1\}\), and they show how to inductively construct
successive problems such that a solution for the \(k^{th}\) problem
implies a solution for the \((k-1)^{th}\) problem. Unraveling the
recursive relationship between the problem domain sizes implies a
general lower bound of roughly \(\log^\ast|X|\) for domain \(X\).</p>

<p>The inclusion of \(\log^\ast\) makes this is an extremely mild lower bound.
However, \(\log^\ast(T)\) can still be arbitrarily larger than 1, so this is
the first definitive evidence that proper approximate privacy introduces
a cost over non-private PAC learning.</p>

<p>In 2018, Alon, Livni, Malliaris, and Moran <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00949" title="Noga Alon, Roi Livni, Maryanthe Malliaris, and Shay Moran. Private PAC learning implies finite Littlestone dimension. STOC 2019"><strong>[ALMM19]</strong></a> extended this
\(\Omega(\log^\ast T)\) lower bound for \(\mathsf{Thresh_T}\) to <em>improper</em>
approximate privacy. More generally, they gave concrete evidence for the
importance of thresholds, which have played a seemingly outsize role in
the work so far. They did so by relating a class’ Littlestone dimension
to its ability to “contain” thresholds. Here, we say \(\mathcal{H}\)
“contains” \(m\) thresholds if there exist \(m\) (unlabeled) examples
\(x_1,\ldots,x_m\) and hypotheses \(h_1, \ldots, h_m \in \mathcal{H}\) such
that the hypotheses “behave like” thresholds on the \(m\) examples, i.e., 
\(h_i(x_j) = 1 \Leftrightarrow j \geq
i\). With this language, they imported a result from model theory to show
that any hypothesis class \(\mathcal{H}\) contains
\(\log(\mathsf{LD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right))\) thresholds. This implies
that learning \(\mathcal{H}\) is at least as hard as learning
\(\mathsf{Thresh_T}\) with
\(T = \log(\mathsf{LD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right))\). Since
\(\log^\ast(\log(\mathsf{LD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)))
= \Omega(\log^\ast(\mathsf{LD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)))\), combining these
two results puts the following limit on private PAC learning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 3</strong> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00949" title="Noga Alon, Roi Livni, Maryanthe Malliaris, and Shay Moran. Private PAC learning implies finite Littlestone dimension. STOC 2019"><strong>[ALMM19]</strong></a>). The sample complexity to approximate private PAC learn \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\Omega(\log^\ast(\mathsf{LD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)))\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Littlestone dimension characterizes online PAC learning, so we now know
that online PAC learnability is necessary for private PAC learnability.
Sufficiency, however, remains an open question. This produces the
following picture, where the dotted line captures the question of
sufficiency.</p>

<h1 id="characterizing-approximate-private-pac-learning">Characterizing Approximate Private PAC Learning</h1>

<p>Spurred by this question, several advances in private PAC learning have
appeared in the last year. First, Gonen, Hazan, and Moran strengthened
Theorem 3 by giving a constructive method for converting
<em>pure</em> private learners to online learners <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11311" title="Alon Gonen, Elad Hazan, and Shay Moran. Private learning implies online learning: An efficient reduction. NeurIPS 2019"><strong>[GHM19]</strong></a>. Their result
reaches back to the 2013 characterization of pure private learning in
terms of representation dimension by using the covering distribution to
generate a collection of “experts” for online learning. Again revisiting
\(\mathsf{Thresh_T}\), Kaplan, Ligett, Mansour, Naor, and
Stemmer <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10137" title="Haim Kaplan, Katrina Ligett, Yishay Mansour, Moni Naor, and Uri Stemmer. Privately learning thresholds: Closing the exponential gap. COLT 2020"><strong>[KLMNS20]</strong></a> significantly reduced the \(O(2^{\log^\ast(T)})\) upper
bound of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07553" title="Mark Bun, Kobbi Nissim, Uri Stemmer, and Salil Vadhan. Differentially private release and learning of threshold functions. FOCS 2015"><strong>[BNSV15]</strong></a> to just \(O((\log^\ast(T))^{1.5})\). And Alon, Beimel,
Moran, and Stemmer <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04509" title="Noga Alon, Amos Beimel, Shay Moran, and Uri Stemmer. Closure properties for private classification and online prediction. COLT 2020"><strong>[ABMS20]</strong></a> justified this post’s focus on realizable
private PAC learning by giving a transformation from a realizable
approximate private PAC learner to an agnostic one at the cost of
slightly worse privacy and sample complexity. This built on an earlier
transformation that only applied to <em>proper</em> learners <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2662" title="Amos Beimel, Kobbi Nissim, and Uri Stemmer. Learning privately with labeled and unlabeled examples. SODA 2015"><strong>[BNS15]</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Finally, Bun, Livni, and Moran <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00563" title="Mark Bun, Roi Livni, and Shay Moran. An equivalence between private classification and online prediction. FOCS 2020"><strong>[BLM20]</strong></a> answered the open question posed
by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00949" title="Noga Alon, Roi Livni, Maryanthe Malliaris, and Shay Moran. Private PAC learning implies finite Littlestone dimension. STOC 2019"><strong>[ALMM19]</strong></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 4</strong> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00563" title="Mark Bun, Roi Livni, and Shay Moran. An equivalence between private classification and online prediction. FOCS 2020"><strong>[BLM20]</strong></a>). The sample complexity to approximate private PAC learn \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(2^{O({\mathsf{LD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)})}\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To prove this, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00563" title="Mark Bun, Roi Livni, and Shay Moran. An equivalence between private classification and online prediction. FOCS 2020"><strong>[BLM20]</strong></a> introduced the notion of a <em>globally stable</em>
learner and showed how to convert an online learner to a globally stable
learner to a private learner. Thus, combined with the result of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00949" title="Noga Alon, Roi Livni, Maryanthe Malliaris, and Shay Moran. Private PAC learning implies finite Littlestone dimension. STOC 2019"><strong>[ALMM19]</strong></a>,
we now know that the sample complexity of private PAC learning any
\(\mathcal{H}\) is at least
\(\Omega(\log^\ast(\mathsf{LD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)))\) and at most
\(2^{O({\mathsf{LD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)})}\). In this sense, online
learnability characterizes private learnability.</p>

<p><img width="400" style="margin: auto; display: block;" alt="Landscape of Private PAC, final take" src="https://differentialprivacy.org/images/private_pac_4.png" /></p>

<p>Narrowing the gap between the lower and upper bounds above is an open
question. Note that we cannot hope to close the gap completely. For the
lower bound, the current \(\mathsf{Thresh_T}\) upper bound implies that no
general lower bound can be stronger than
\(\Omega((\log^\ast(\mathsf{LD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)))^{1.5})\). For the
upper bound, there exist hypotheses classes \(\mathcal{H}\) with
\(\mathsf{VCD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right) = \mathsf{LD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right)\)
(e.g., \(\mathsf{VCD}\left(\mathsf{Point}_d\right) = \mathsf{LD}\left(\mathsf{Point}_d\right)= 1\)), so since non-private PAC learning requires
\(\Omega(\mathsf{VCD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right))\) samples, the best
possible private PAC learning upper bound is
\(O(\mathsf{LD}\left(\mathcal{H}\right))\). Nevertheless, proving either
bound remains open.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>This concludes our post, and with it our discussion of this fundamental
question: the price of privacy in machine learning. We now know that in
the PAC model, proper pure private learning, improper pure private
learning, approximate private learning, and non-private learning are all
strongly separated. By the connection to Littlestone dimension, we also
know that approximate private learnability is equivalent to online
learnability. However, many questions about computational efficiency and
tight sample complexity bounds remain open.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the introduction, we focused on the clean yet widely
studied and influential model of PAC learning. Having characterized how
privacy enters the picture in PAC learning, we can hopefully convey this
understanding to other models of learning, and now approach these
questions from a rigorous and grounded point of view.</p>

<p>Congratulations to Mark Bun, Roi Livni, and Shay Moran on their best
paper award — and to the many individuals who paved the way before
them!</p>

Tree codes are combinatorial structures introduced by Schulman (STOC 1993) as key ingredients in interactive coding schemes. Asymptotically-good tree codes are long known to exist, yet their explicit construction remains a notoriously hard open problem. Even proposing a plausible construction, without the burden of proof, is difficult and the defining tree code property requires structure that remains elusive. To the best of our knowledge, only one candidate appears in the literature, due to Moore and Schulman (ITCS 2014).

We put forth a new candidate for an explicit asymptotically-good tree code. Our construction is an extension of the vanishing rate tree code by Cohen-Haeupler-Schulman (STOC 2018) combined with a vanishing distance tree code by Gelles et al. (SODA 2016). The correctness of our construction relies on a conjecture that we introduce on certain Pascal determinants indexed by the points of the Boolean hypercube. We furnish evidence supporting our conjecture through numerical computation, combinatorial arguments from planar path graphs and based on well-studied heuristics from arithmetic geometry.</div>

We study the problem of testing discrete distributions with a focus on the high probability regime.
Specifically, given samples from one or more discrete distributions, a property $\mathcal{P}$, and 
parameters $0&lt; \epsilon, \delta &lt;1$, we want to distinguish {\em with probability at least $1-\delta$}
whether these distributions satisfy $\mathcal{P}$ or are $\epsilon$-far from $\mathcal{P}$
in total variation distance. Most prior work in distribution testing studied the constant confidence case 
(corresponding to $\delta = \Omega(1)$), and provided sample-optimal testers for a range of properties.
While one can always boost the confidence probability of any such tester by black-box amplification, 
this generic boosting method typically leads to sub-optimal sample bounds.

Here we study the following broad question: For a given property $\mathcal{P}$, can we {\em characterize} 
the sample complexity of testing $\mathcal{P}$ as a function of all relevant problem parameters, 
including the error probability $\delta$? Prior to this work, uniformity testing was the only statistical task
whose sample complexity had been characterized in this setting. As our main results,
we provide the first algorithms for closeness and independence testing that are sample-optimal, within 
constant factors, as a function of all relevant parameters. We also show matching
information-theoretic lower bounds on the sample complexity of these problems.
Our techniques naturally extend to give optimal testers for  related problems. To illustrate the generality of our methods, 
we give optimal algorithms for testing collections of distributions and testing closeness with unequal sized samples.</div>

<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (Sep. 17):</span></strong> Several people, here and elsewhere, wrote to tell me that while they completely agreed with my strategic and moral stance in this post, they think that it’s the ads of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC03-Q9vq-JyiStTnqasADVg">Republican Voters Against Trump</a>, rather than the Lincoln Project, that have been most effective in changing Trump supporters’ minds.

<p></p><hr /><p></p>



<p>For the past few months, I’ve alternated between periods of debilitating depression and (thankfully) longer stretches when I’m more-or-less able to work.  Triggers for my depressive episodes include reading social media, watching my 7-year daughter struggle with prolonged isolation, and (especially) contemplating the ongoing apocalypse in the American West, the hundreds of thousands of pointless covid deaths, and an election in 48 days that <em>if I didn’t know such things were impossible in America</em> would seem <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/09/14/michael-caputo-coronavirus-cdc/">likely</a> to produce a terrifying standoff as a despot and millions of his armed loyalists refuse to cede control.  Meanwhile, catalysts for my relatively functional periods have included teaching my undergrad <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/qclec.pdf">quantum information class</a>, Zoom calls with my students, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1174-4">life on Venus?!?</a> (my guess is no, but almost entirely due to priors), learning new math (fulfilling a decades-old goal, I’m finally working my way through Paul Cohen’s celebrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forcing_(mathematics)">proof</a> of the independence of the Continuum Hypothesis—more about that later!).</p>



<p>Of course, when you feel crushed by the weight of the world’s horribleness, it improves your mood to be able even just to prick the horribleness with a pin.  So I was gratified that, in response to a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4942">previous post</a>, <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers contributed at least $3,000, the first $2,000 of which I matched, mostly to the <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/duforjoe">Biden-Harris campaign</a> but a little to the <a href="https://lincolnproject.us/donate/">Lincoln Project</a>.</p>



<p>Alas, a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4942#comment-1856922">commenter</a> was unhappy with the latter:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Lincoln Project? Really? … Pushing the Overton window rightward during a worldwide fascist dawn isn’t good. I have trouble understanding why even extremely smart people have trouble with this sort of thing.</p></blockquote>



<p>Since this is actually important, I’d like to spend the rest of this post responding to it.</p>



<p>For me it’s simple.</p>



<p>What’s the goal right now?  To defeat Trump.  In the US right now, that’s the prerequisite to <strong>every other</strong> sane political goal.</p>



<p>What will it take to achieve that goal? Turnout, energizing the base, defending the election process … but also, if possible, <em>persuading a sliver of Trump supporters in swing states to switch sides</em>, or at least vote third party or abstain.</p>



<p>Who is actually effective at that goal?  Well, no one knows for sure.  But while I thought the Biden campaign had some semi-decent ads, the Lincoln Project’s best stuff seems <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uLJkpH__os">better</a> to me, just savagely good.</p>



<p><em>Why</em> are they effective?  The answer seems obvious: for the same reason why a jilted ex is a more dangerous foe than a stranger.  If <em>anyone</em> understood how to deprogram a Republican from the Trump cult, who would it be: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, or a fellow Republican who successfully broke from the cult?</p>



<p>Do I agree with the Lincoln Republicans about most of the “normal” issues that Americans once argued about?  Not at all.  Do I hold them, in part, morally responsible for creating the preconditions to the current nightmare?  Certainly.</p>



<p>And should any of that cause me to boycott them? Not in my moral universe.  If Churchill and FDR could team up with Stalin, then surely we in the Resistance can temporarily ally ourselves with the rare Republicans who chose their stated principles over power when tested—their very rarity attesting to the nontriviality of their choice.</p>



<p>To my mind, turning one’s back on would-be allies, in a conflict whose stakes obviously overshadow what’s bad about those allies, is simultaneously one of the dumbest <em>and</em> the ugliest things that human beings can do.  It abandons reason for moral purity and ends up achieving neither.</p></div>

<p>Ken Regan is of course my partner on GLL. He is faculty in the computer science department at the University of Buffalo. His PhD was in 1986 from Oxford University and it was titled <i>On the separation of complexity classes</i>. He was the PhD student of Dominic Welsh who was a student of John Hammersley.</p>
<p>Today I would like to wish Ken a happy birthday.</p>
<p>He is now 61 years young. I hope you will join me and wish him many more birthdays. His age is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/61_(number)">special</a> for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a twin prime.</li>
<li>It is equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%5E%7B2%7D+%2B+6%5E%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{5^{2} + 6^{2}}" class="latex" title="{5^{2} + 6^{2}}" />.</li>
<li>It is the ninth Mersenne prime: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7B61%7D+-+1+%3D+2%2C305%2C843%2C009%2C213%2C693%2C951%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^{61} - 1 = 2,305,843,009,213,693,951}" class="latex" title="{2^{61} - 1 = 2,305,843,009,213,693,951}" />.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three big <b>I’s</b> in his life. Let’s talk about two of them.</p>
<h2>Interest in Cricket</h2>
<p>Ken loves sports in general and especially cricket. Last Sunday he told me he watched his Bills win their first NFL game while he watched a cricket match. I have no idea how cricket works, but here is Ken’s <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/Writing/CricketBaseball.html">explanation</a>: <i>Are Cricket and Baseball sister games?</i></p>
<table style="margin: auto;">

<ul>
<li>In a baseball game you see pitchers on the field.<br />
In a cricket match you see fielders on the pitch.</li>
<li>In baseball, a bad delivery is called a “Ball”.<br />
In cricket, it’s a “No Ball”.</li>
<li>In baseball, if a batter carries his bat, he’s out.<br />
In cricket, the batsmen always carry their bat, and an opening batsman who “carries his bat” is never out.</li>
<li>In baseball, an innings is called a half-inning.<br />
In cricket, an inning is called an innings.</li>
<li>In baseball, a batter hit by a pitched ball gets a free pass to First Base.<br />
In cricket, such a batter can be Out Leg Before Wicket.</li>
<li>In baseball, if a ball is caught over the boundary, “yer out!”<br />
In cricket, you score 6 runs.</li>
<li>In baseball, when a batter “walks”, he gets a free pass to first and is not out.<br />
In cricket, it means the batsman declares himself out before the umpire has a chance to make the call. This classic show of sportsmanship is considered unsportsmanlike in baseball.<p></p>
<h2>Interest in Chess</h2>
<p>When the chess world wants to know if someone has cheated, they call Ken. He is an international chess master, and has worked on stopping cheating for years. It is important these days, since most tournaments are now online. And cheating is easier when no one is directly able to watch you. Ken is busy.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the cheating problem. Suppose that Alice and Bob are playing an online game of chess. Alice makes her own moves, but she wonders if Bob could be cheating. He could be using advice from another “player”, Sally. There are several points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sally is a stronger player than anyone—she can easily beat Alice and Bob.</li>
<li>Sally not only says “here is my move”—she will sometimes give several good moves.</li>
<li>Sally is a program that is deterministic—given a position she gives the same answer.The issue for Ken is: When Alice played Bob did Bob make the moves or did he consult Sally?
</li></ol>
<p>There are many complexities:</p>
<ol>
<li>What if Bob agreed with all Sally’s moves? Then he certainly did cheat.</li>
<li>What if Bob was just lucky and played above his strength? Then he did not cheat.</li>
<li>What if Bob used Sally for some positions but not others? Then he did cheat, but it may be hard to be sure.</li>
<li>And so on.</li>
</ol>
<p>What Ken has done is create both a theory and programs to determine whether Bob did indeed cheat. I find the general problem of telling if one cheats online at chess to be fascinating. See us <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/06/18/the-problem-of-catching-chess-cheaters/">before</a> for more details and also see <a href="http://www.uschess.org/index.php/June/How-To-Catch-A-Chess-Cheater-Ken-Regan-Finds-Moves-Out-Of-Mind.html">this</a>.</p>
<h2>Open Problems</h2>
<p>Ken is one of the nicest people I know. Hope he has many more birthdays and many more twin primes.</p>

<div class="content">
Consider the problem of computing the majority of a stream of $n$ i.i.d. uniformly random bits. This problem, known as the {\it coin problem}, is central to a number of counting problems in different data stream models. We show that any streaming algorithm for solving this problem with large constant advantage must use $\Omega(\log n)$ bits of space. We extend our lower bound to proving tight lower bounds for solving multiple, randomly interleaved copies of the coin problem, as well as for solving the OR of multiple copies of a variant of the coin problem. Our proofs involve new measures of information complexity that are well-suited for data streams. 

We use these lower bounds to obtain a number of new results for data streams. In each case there is an underlying $d$-dimensional vector $x$ with additive updates to its coordinates given in a stream of length $m$. The input streams arising from our coin lower bound have nice distributional properties, and consequently for many problems for which we only had lower bounds in general turnstile streams, we now obtain the same lower bounds in more natural models, such as the bounded deletion model, in which $\|x\|_2$ never drops by a constant fraction of what it was earlier, or in the random order model, in which the updates are ordered randomly. In particular, in the bounded deletion model, we obtain nearly tight lower bounds for approximating $\|x\|_{\infty}$ up to additive error $\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} \|x\|_2$, approximating $\|x\|_2$ up to a multiplicative $(1 + \epsilon)$ factor (resolving a question of Jayaram and Woodruff in PODS 2018), and solving the Point Query and $\ell_2$-Heavy Hitters Problems. In the random order model, we also obtain new lower bounds for the Point Query and $\ell_2$-Heavy Hitters Problems. 
We also give new algorithms complementing our lower bounds and illustrating the tightness of the models we consider, including an algorithm for approximating $\|x\|_{\infty}$ up to additive error $\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} \|x\|_2$ in turnstile streams (resolving a question of Cormode in a 2006 IITK Workshop), and an algorithm for finding $\ell_2$-heavy hitters in randomly ordered insertion streams (which for random order streams, resolves a question of Nelson in a 2018 Warwick Workshop).</div>

Nisheeth Vishnoi is a professor at Yale University in the computer science department. The faculty <a href="https://cpsc.yale.edu/people/faculty">there</a> is impressive and includes many of the top researchers in the world. The CS faculty is pretty good too. As Nisheeth’s PhD advisor, years ago, I am proud that he is at Yale. </p>
<p>
Today I wish to discuss a new book by Nisheeth. </p>
<p>
The title is <a href="https://convex-optimization.github.io/ACO-v1.pdf">Algorithms for Convex Optimization</a>. Let me jump ahead and say that I like the book and especially this insight: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>One way to solve discrete problems is to apply continuous methods.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not a new insight, but is an important one. Continuous math is older than discrete and often is more powerful. Some examples of this are:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" title="{\bullet}" /> Analytic number theory is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_number_theory">based</a> on the behavior of continuous functions. Some of the deepest theorems on prime numbers use such methods. Think of the Riemann zeta function 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Czeta%28s%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%5Cinfty+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%5Es%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B1%5Es%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%5Es%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%5Es%7D+%2B+%5Ccdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s} = \frac{1}{1^s} + \frac{1}{2^s} + \frac{1}{3^s} + \cdots " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s} = \frac{1}{1^s} + \frac{1}{2^s} + \frac{1}{3^s} + \cdots " /></p>
<p>as a function of complex numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{s}" class="latex" title="{s}" />.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" title="{\bullet}" /> Additive number theory is <a href="https://encyclopediaofmath.org/wiki/Additive_number_theory">based</a> on the behavior of continuous functions. Think of generating functions and Fourier methods. </p>
<p>
The power of continuous methods is one that I sometimes forget. Nisheeth’s book is a testament to the power of this idea. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Convexity </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Nisheeth’s book uses another fundamental idea from complexity theory. This is: restrict problems in some way. Allowing too large a class usually makes complexity high. For example, trees are easier in general than planar graphs, and sparse graphs are easier than general graphs. Of course “in general” must be controlled, but restricting the problem types does often reduce complexity. </p>
<p>
Convexity adds to this tradition since <em>convex</em> generalizes the notion of <em>linear</em>. And convex problems of all kinds are abundant in practice, abundant in theory, and are important.</p>

Here is a passage by Roman Dwilewicz on the <a href="http://www.mathem.pub.ro/dgds/v11/D11-DW.pdf">history</a> of the convexity concept:</p>

<p>It seems that the first more rigorous definition of convexity was given by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes">Archimedes</a> of Syracuse, (ca 287 – ca 212 B.C.) in his treatise: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Sphere_and_Cylinder">On the sphere and cylinder</a>. </p>

Okay, I am not an expert on convex algorithms, nor am I an expert on this type of geometric theory. But I definitely like his viewpoint. Let me explain in a moment. </p>

</p><p></p><h2> Discrete vs Continuous Methods </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Nisheeth in his introduction explains how continuous methods help in many combinatorial problems, like finding flows on graphs. He uses the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{s}" class="latex" title="{s}" />—<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> flow problem as his example. The <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{s}" class="latex" title="{s}" />—<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" />-maximum flow problem arises in real-world scheduling problems, but is also a fundamental combinatorial problem that can be used to find a maximum matching in a bipartite graph, for example.</p>

<i>Combinatorial algorithms for the maximum flow problem</i>. He points out that by building on the Ford-Fulkerson method, various polynomial-time results were proved and other bounds were improved. But he states that the <i>improvements stopped in 1998.</i> Discrete methods seem to be unable to improve complexity for flow problems. </p>
<p>
<i>Convex programming-based algorithms</i>. He adds: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Starting with the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.2921.pdf">paper</a> by Paul Christiano, Jonathan Kelner, Aleksander Mądry, Daniel Spielman, Shang-Hua Teng<br />
the last decade has seen striking progress on the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{s}" class="latex" title="{s}" />–<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> maximum flow problem. One of the keys to this success has been to abandon combinatorial approaches and view the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{s}" class="latex" title="{s}" />–<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> maximum flow problem through the lens of continuous optimization.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>
Thus, at this point it may seem like we are heading in the wrong direction. We started off with a combinatorial problem that is a special type of a linear programming problem, and here we are with a nonlinear optimization formulation for it. Thus the questions arise: which formulation should we chose? and, why should this convex optimization approach lead us to faster algorithms? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Take a look at Nisheeth’s <a href="https://convex-optimization.github.io">site</a> for the answers.</p>
<p>
I wish I were better informed about continuous methods in general. They are powerful and pretty. Maybe I could solve an open problem that I have thought about if I knew this material better. Hmmm. Maybe it will help you solve some open problem of your own. Take a look at his book.</p>

We prove that the Impagliazzo-Nisan-Wigderson (STOC 1994) pseudorandom generator (PRG) fools ordered (read-once) permutation branching programs of unbounded width with a seed length of $\widetilde{O}(\log d + \log n \cdot \log(1/\varepsilon))$, assuming the program has only one accepting vertex in the final layer. Here, $n$ is the length of the program, $d$ is the degree (equivalently, the alphabet size), and $\varepsilon$ is the error of the PRG. In contrast, we show that a randomly chosen generator requires seed length $\Omega(n \log d)$ to fool such unbounded-width programs. Thus, this is an unusual case where an explicit construction is "better than random."

Except when the program's width $w$ is very small, this is an improvement over prior work. For example, when $w = \text{poly}(n)$ and d = 2, the best prior PRG for permutation branching programs was simply Nisan's PRG (Combinatorica 1992), which fools general ordered branching programs with seed length $O(\log(wn/\varepsilon) \log n)$. We prove a seed length lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}(\log d + \log n \cdot \log(1/\varepsilon))$ for fooling these unbounded-width programs, showing that our seed length is near-optimal. In fact, when $\varepsilon \leq 1 / \log n$, our seed length is within a constant factor of optimal. Our analysis of the INW generator uses the connection between the PRG and the derandomized square of Rozenman and Vadhan (RANDOM 2005) and the recent analysis of the latter in terms of unit-circle approximation by Ahmadinejad et al. (FOCS 2020).</div>

The field of Interactive Coding studies how an interactive protocol can be made resilient to channel errors. Even though this field has received abundant attention since Schulman's seminal paper (FOCS 92), constructing interactive coding schemes that are both deterministic and efficient, and at the same time resilient to adversarial errors (with constant information and error rates), remains an elusive open problem.

An appealing approach towards resolving this problem is to show efficiently encodable and decodable constructions of a combinatorial object called tree codes (Schulman, STOC 93). After a lot of effort in this direction, the current state of the art has deterministic constructions of tree codes that are efficiently encodable but require a logarithmic (instead of constant) alphabet (Cohen, Haeupler, and Schulman, STOC 18). However, we still lack (even heuristic) candidate constructions that are efficiently decodable. 

In this work, we show that tree codes that are efficiently encodable, {\em but not efficiently decodable}, also imply deterministic and efficient interactive coding schemes that are resilient to adversarial errors. Our result immediately implies a deterministic and efficient interactive coding scheme with a logarithmic alphabet (i.e., $1/\log \log$ rate). We show this result using a novel implementation of hashing through deterministic tree codes that is powerful enough to yield interactive coding schemes.</div>

We construct an explicit family of 3XOR instances which is hard for Omega(sqrt(log n)) levels of the Sum-of-Squares hierarchy. In contrast to earlier constructions, which involve a random component, our systems can be constructed explicitly in deterministic polynomial time.
Our construction is based on the high-dimensional expanders devised by Lubotzky, Samuels and Vishne, known as LSV complexes or Ramanujan complexes, and our analysis is based on two notions of expansion for these complexes: cosystolic expansion, and a local isoperimetric inequality due to Gromov.
Our construction offers an interesting contrast to the recent work of Alev, Jeronimo and the last author (FOCS 2019). They showed that 3XOR instances in which the variables correspond to vertices in a high-dimensional expander are easy to solve. In contrast, in our instances the variables correspond to the edges of the complex.</div>

<p>
Moshe Vardi holds multiple professorships at Rice University. He is also the Senior Editor of <em>Communications of the ACM</em>. His is therefore a voice to be reckoned with in the current debate over how best to teach during the pandemic. Much of the debate is over whether all should hear his voice the same way, or some hear it in the classroom while others hear it remotely. </p>
<p>
Today we note his recent <a href="https://medium.com/@vardi/covid-19-the-ford-pinto-and-american-higher-ed-2b191920b065">column</a> for <em>Medium</em> advocating the former. Then I (Ken) give some of my own impressions.</p>
<p>
His September 5 column followed an August 8 <a href="https://www.ricethresher.org/article/2020/08/return-to-campus-but-to-what-end">opinion</a> given to the Rice student newspaper. Both begin with concern over the conflict between <em>safety</em> and <em>value</em> for students. Much of the value of college—<em>most</em> according to statistics he cites—comes from being collegial: outside the classroom. But many such activities, not only evening parties but informal games and gatherings, are the most unsafe. </p>
<p>
We will focus however on what Moshe says about the nature of instruction for lecture courses. Certainly for laboratory courses there is a sharp trade-off between safety and in-person interaction. But we focus here on what he says about the nature of teaching in the lecture hall, where one can take safety as a given requirement. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> An In-Person Remoteness Paradox </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I have just returned from sabbatical at the University at Buffalo (UB) and am teaching this fall a small elective 4xx/5xx theory course. It has 15 students, smaller than the 25 in the hypothetical class Moshe describes but of the same order of magnitude. In the spring I will be teaching a larger undergraduate course which is also on target for his concerns. I have taught such a class every spring for a decade. While this assignment is not a new to me, the issue of safety raises tough choices about the delivery options. My options are: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<em>remote-only</em>; <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>in-person only</em>; <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>hybrid</em> use of 1 and 2 for designated course components; <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>hybrid-flexible</em>, meaning 1 and 2 are conducted simultaneously with students free to choose either option, even on a per-lecture basis.
</li></ol>
<p>
I have committed to hybrid-flexible. For my current fall course, I made this commitment in early summer when there was uncertainty over in-person instruction requirements for student visas and registration. I believe that my larger course will be implemented as safely in a large room as my current course. The question is quality.</p>
<p>
Moshe notes right away a paradox for his hypothetical class that could apply to any of modes 2–4; to include the last expressly, I’ve inserted the word “even”:</p>
<blockquote><p> <em> …I realized that [even] the students <b>in the classroom</b> will have to be communicating with me on Zoom, to be heard and recorded. All this, while both the students and I are wearing face masks. It dawned on me then that I will be conducting remote teaching <b>in the classroom</b>. </em>

<p>
In fact, I have one volunteer now in the room logging into Zoom to help with interaction from those attending remotely. This helps because my podium has less space to catch faces and detect questions right away. I do repeat questions so they are picked up in the recording and often redirect them to the class. Still, the mere fact of my not seeing faces alongside the notes and interactive drawings I am sharing makes me feel Moshe’s paradox all the time. This is even though my room allows denser spacing than at Rice, so a class of 25 could sit closer.  Let me, however, say why I love stand-up teaching before addressing his paramount question of what is best for the students at this time.</p>

<p></p><p>
Dick once wrote a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/11/07/in-praise-of-chalk-talks/">post</a>, “In Praise of Chalk Talks.” First, with reference to talks pre-made using PowerPoint or LaTeX slides, Dick wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Such talks can be informative and easy to follow, yet sometimes PowerPoint is not well suited to giving a proof. The slides do not hold enough <b>state</b> for us to easily follow the argument. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Moreover, when I contributed to the open-problems session of the workshop at IAS in Princeton, NJ that we <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/06/06/princeton-is-invariant/">covered</a> two years ago, Avi Wigderson insisted that everyone use chalk, not slides. I’ve used slides for UB’s data-structures and programming languages courses, but I think students benefit from seeing proofs and problem-solving ideas <em>grow</em>.</p>
<p>
I find furthermore that the feel of immersion in a process of discovery is enhanced by an in-person presence. I had this in mind when I followed Dick’s post with a long one <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/11/15/the-graph-of-math/">imagining</a> Kurt Gödel expounding the distinctive points of his set theory (joint with Paul Bernays and John von Neumann), all on one chalkboard. My classes are not as interactive as in that post, but I prepare junctures in lectures for posing questions and doing a little bit of Socratic method. And I try to lead this with body language as well as voice inflection, whether at a whiteboard or drawing on hard paper via a document camera. </p>
<p>
Still, it exactly this “extra” that gets diminished for those who are remote. When I share my screen for notes or a drawing (both in <a href="https://www.mathcha.io/">MathCha</a>), they see my movements only in a small second window if at all. They do hear my voice—but I do not hear theirs even if they unmute themselves. Nor can I read their state of following as I do in the room. Without reiterating the safety factor as Moshe does, I can reformulate his key question as:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Does the non-uniformity and inequality of hybrid delivery outweigh the benefits of making in-person instruction available to some? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
I must quickly add that in-person teaching is perceived as a collective need at UB. The web form I filled for Spring 2021 stated that some in-person classes must be available at all levels, 1xx through 7xx. I am happy to oblige. But the fact that I chose a flexible structure, especially in a small class, does allow the students to give opinion on this question, as well as on something Moshe says next:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Remote teaching” actually can do a better job of reproducing the intimacy that we take for granted in small classes. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Toward this end, I am implementing a remote version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutorial_system">tutorial system</a> I was part of for two eight-week terms at Oxford while a junior fellow of Merton College. When Cambridge University <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/education-52732814">declared</a> already last May that there would be no in-person lectures all the way through summer 2021, this is because most lectures there are formally optional anyway. The heart of required teaching is via weekly tutorial hours in groups of one-to-three students. They are organized separately by each of thirty-plus constituent colleges rather than by department-centered staff, so the numbers are divided to be manageable. In my math-course tutorials the expectation was for each student to present a solved problem and participate in discussions that build on the methods. </p>
<p>
I am doing this every other week this fall, alternating with weeks of problem-set review that will be strictly optional and classed as enhanced office hours. All UB office hours must be remote anyway. The tutorial requirement was agreed by student voice-vote in a tradeoff with lowering the material in timed exams to compensate for differences in home situations. After a few weeks of this, the class will take stock for opinions on which delivery options work best. UB has already committed to being remote-only after Thanksgiving, and it is possible that the on-campus medical situation will trigger an earlier conversion anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We would like to throw the floor open for comment on Moshe’s matters that we’ve highlighted and on his other opinions about the university mission amid the current crisis more generally. </p>
<p>
[edited to reflect that at Rice too, the hypothetical class could be in any of modes 2–4, and that spacing is further than in my UB room.  “Princeton IAS” -&gt; “IAS in Princeton, NJ”]</p></font></font></div>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Know of a great recent paper that should be highlighted to the theory community and beyond? Email a nomination to <a href="mailto:sigact.highlights.nominations@outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sigact.highlights.nominations@outlook.com</a> by October 19th.</p>



<p>The goal of the SIGACT Research Highlights Committee is to help promote<br />top computer science theory research via identifying results that are of<br />high quality and broad appeal to the general computer science audience.<br />These results would then be recommended for consideration for the <a href="http://cacm.acm.org">CACM</a> <em>Research Highlights</em> section as well as other general-audience computer science research outlets.</p>



<p><strong>Nomination and Selection Process:</strong></p>



<p>The committee solicits two types of nominations:</p>



<p>1) <strong>Conference nominations.</strong> Each year, the committee will ask the PC<br />chairs of theoretical computer science conferences to send a selection<br />of up to three top papers from these conferences (selected based on both<br />their technical merit and breadth of interest to non-theory audience)<br />and forwarding them to the committee for considerations.</p>



<p>2) <strong>Community nominations. </strong>The committee will accept nominations from the members of the community. Each such nomination should summarize the contribution of the nominated paper and also argue why this paper is<br />suitable for broader outreach. The nomination should be no more than a<br />page in length and can be submitted at any time by emailing it to<br /><a href="mailto:sigact.highlights.nominations@outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sigact.highlights.nominations@outlook.com</a>. Self-nominations are<br />discouraged.</p>



<p>The nomination deadline is <strong>Monday, October 19, 2020 </strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Committee:</strong></p>



<p>The SIGACT Research Highlights Committee currently comprises the<br />following members:</p>



<p>Boaz Barak, Harvard University<br />Irit Dinur, Weizmann Institute of Science<br />Aleksander Mądry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (chair)<br />Jelani Nelson, University of California, Berkeley</p></div>
