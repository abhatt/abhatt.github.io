Recently, using spectral techniques, H. Huang proved that every subgraph of the hypercube of dimension n induced on more than half the vertices has maximum degree at least the square root of n. Combined with some earlier work, this completed a proof of the sensitivity conjecture. In this work we show how to derive a proof of Huang’s result using only linear dependency and independence of vectors associated with the vertices of the hypercube. Our approach leads to several improvements of the result. In particular we prove that in any induced subgraph of the hypercube with more than half the number of vertices, there are two vertices, one of odd parity and the other of even parity, each with at least n vertices at distance at most 2. As an application we show that for any Boolean function f, the polynomial degree of f is bounded above by the product of the 0- and 1-sensitivities, a strictly stronger statement which implies the sensitivity conjecture.</div>

Tracking Paths problem asks whether there exists at most $k$ vertices, which if
marked as trackers, would ensure that the sequence of trackers encountered in
each s-t path is unique. The problem was first proposed by Banik et al. in
\cite{DBLP:conf/ciac/BanikKPS17}, where they gave results for some restricted
versions of the problem. The problem was further studied in \cite{banik2019},
where the authors proved it to be NP-complete and fixed-parameter tractable.
They obtained a kernel (i.e. an equivalent instance) with $O(k^6)$ vertices and
$O(k^7)$ edges, in polynomial time. We improve on this by giving a quadratic
kernel, i.e. $O(k^2)$ vertices and edges. Further, we prove that if $G$ is a
$d$-degenerate graph then there exists a linear kernel. We also show that
finding a tracking set of size at most $n-k$ for a graph on $n$ vertices is
hard for the parameterized complexity class W[1], when parameterized by $k$.

set of elements. BF variants allow removals, sets of unbounded size or querying
a sliding window over an unbounded stream. However, for this last case the best
current approaches are dictionary based (e.g., based on Cuckoo Filters or
TinyTable), and it may seem that BF-based approaches will never be competitive
to dictionary-based ones. In this paper we present Age-Partitioned Bloom
Filters, a BF-based approach for duplicate detection in sliding windows that
not only is competitive in time-complexity, but has better space usage than
current dictionary-based approaches (e.g., SWAMP), at the cost of some moderate
slack. APBFs retain the BF simplicity, unlike dictionary-based approaches,
important for hardware-based implementations, and can integrate known
improvements such as double hashing or blocking. We present an Age-Partitioned
Blocked Bloom Filter variant which can operate with 2-3 cache-line accesses per
insertion and around 2-4 per query, even for high accuracy filters.

individuals who not only have the required skills to perform a task but who can
also communicate effectively with each other. Existing work assumes that all
links in a social network are positive, that is, they indicate friendship or
collaboration between individuals. However, it is often the case that the
network is signed, that is, it contains both positive and negative links,
corresponding to friend and foe relationships. Building on the concept of
structural balance, we provide definitions of compatibility between pairs of
users in a signed network, and algorithms for computing it. We then define the
team formation problem in signed networks, where we ask for a compatible team
of individuals that can perform a task with small communication cost. We show
that the problem is NP-hard even when there are no communication cost
constraints, and we provide heuristic algorithms for solving it. We present
experimental results with real data to investigate the properties of the
different compatibility definitions, and the effectiveness of our algorithms.

and have to be matched immediately and irrevocably to a given set of servers,
all on the real line. The goal is to minimize the sum of distances from the
requests to their respective servers. Despite all research efforts, it remains
an intriguing open question whether there exists an $O(1)$-competitive
algorithm. The best known online algorithm by Raghvendra [SoCG18] achieves a
competitive factor of $\Theta(\log n)$. This result matches a lower bound of
$\Omega(\log n)$ [Latin18] that holds for a quite large class of online
algorithms, including all deterministic algorithms in the literature.
</p>
<p>In this work we approach the problem in a recourse model where we allow to
revoke online decisions to some extent. We show an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm
for online matching on the line that uses at most $O(n\log n)$ reassignments.
This is the first non-trivial result for min-cost bipartite matching with
recourse. For so-called alternating instances, with no more than one request
between two servers, we obtain a near-optimal result. We give a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-competitive algorithm that reassigns any request at most
$O(\varepsilon^{-1.001})$ times. This special case is interesting as the
aforementioned quite general lower bound $\Omega(\log n)$ holds for such
instances.

from a collection, which is a fundamental problem and has a wide range of
applications, e.g., in Web search. Diversity under a uniform or partition
matroid constraint naturally describes useful cardinality or budget
requirements, and admits simple approximation algorithms. When applied to
clustered data, however, popular algorithms such as picking objects iteratively
and performing local search lose their approximation guarantees towards maximum
intra-cluster diversity because they fail to optimize the objective in a global
manner. We propose an algorithm that greedily adds a pair of objects instead of
a singleton, % with respect to some intuitive measure at a time, and which
attains a constant approximation factor over clustered data. We further extend
the algorithm to the case of monotone and submodular quality function, and
under a partition matroid constraint. We also devise a technique to make our
algorithm scalable, and on the way we obtain a modification that gives better
solutions in practice while maintaining the approximation guarantee in theory.
Our algorithm achieves excellent performance, compared to strong baselines in a
mix of synthetic and real-world datasets.

<p><b>Authors: </b>Mustafa Safa Ozdayi <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.03015">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>In the setting of online algorithms, the input is initially not present but
rather arrive one-by-one over time and after each input, the algorithm has to
make a decision. Depending on the formulation of the problem, the algorithm
might be allowed to change its previous decisions or not at a later time. We
analyze two problems to show that it is possible for an online algorithm to
become more competitive by changing its former decisions. We first consider the
online edge orientation in which the edges arrive one-by-one to an empty graph
and the aim is to orient them in a way such that the maximum in-degree is
minimized. We then consider the online bipartite b-matching. In this problem,
we are given a bipartite graph where one side of the graph is initially present
and where the other side arrive online. The goal is to maintain a matching set
such that the maximum degree in the set is minimized. For both of the problems,
the best achievable competitive ratio is $\Theta(\log n)$ over n input arrivals
when decisions are irreversible. We study three algorithms for these problems,
two for the former and one for the latter, that achieve O(1) competitive ratio
by changing O(n) of their decisions over n arrivals. In addition to that, we
analyze one of the algorithms, the shortest path algorithm, against an
adversary. Through that, we prove some new results about algorithms
performance.

learning can or cannot learn in poly-time. A universality result is proved for
SGD-based deep learning and a non-universality result is proved for GD-based
deep learning; this also gives a separation between SGD-based deep learning and
statistical query algorithms:
</p>
<p>(1) {\it Deep learning with SGD is efficiently universal.} Any function
distribution that can be learned from samples in poly-time can also be learned
by a poly-size neural net trained with SGD on a poly-time initialization with
poly-steps, poly-rate and possibly poly-noise.
</p>
<p>Therefore deep learning provides a universal learning paradigm: it was known
that the approximation and estimation errors could be controlled with poly-size
neural nets, using ERM that is NP-hard; this new result shows that the
optimization error can also be controlled with SGD in poly-time. The picture
changes for GD with large enough batches:
</p>
<p>(2) {\it Result (1) does not hold for GD:} Neural nets of poly-size trained
with GD (full gradients or large enough batches) on any initialization with
poly-steps, poly-range and at least poly-noise cannot learn any function
distribution that has super-polynomial {\it cross-predictability,} where the
cross-predictability gives a measure of ``average'' function correlation --
relations and distinctions to the statistical dimension are discussed. In
particular, GD with these constraints can learn efficiently monomials of degree
$k$ if and only if $k$ is constant.
</p>
<p>Thus (1) and (2) point to an interesting contrast: SGD is universal even with
some poly-noise while full GD or SQ algorithms are not (e.g., parities).

communication over noisy channels, a necessary endeavor if we wish to fully
reap quantum advantages for communication. For an arbitrary protocol with $n$
messages, designed for a noiseless qudit channel over a $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ size
alphabet, our main result is a simulation method that fails with probability
less than $2^{-\Theta(n\epsilon)}$ and uses a qudit channel over the same
alphabet $n\left(1+\Theta \left(\sqrt{\epsilon}\right)\right)$ times, of which
an $\epsilon$ fraction can be corrupted adversarially. The simulation is thus
capacity achieving to leading order, and we conjecture that it is optimal up to
a constant factor in the $\sqrt{\epsilon}$ term. Furthermore, the simulation is
in a model that does not require pre-shared resources such as randomness or
entanglement between the communicating parties. Our work improves over the best
previously known quantum result where the overhead is a non-explicit large
constant [Brassard et al., FOCS'14] for low $\epsilon$.

Benson</a>, Jon Kleinberg <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.02817">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>The minimum $s$-$t$ cut problem in graphs is one of the most fundamental
problems in combinatorial optimization, and graph cuts underlie algorithms
throughout discrete mathematics, theoretical computer science, operations
research, and data science. While graphs are a standard model for pairwise
relationships, hypergraphs provide the flexibility to model multi-way
relationships, and are now a standard model for complex data and systems.
However, when generalizing from graphs to hypergraphs, the notion of a "cut
hyperedge" is less clear, as a hyperedge's nodes can be split in several ways.
Here, we develop a framework for hypergraph cuts by considering the problem of
separating two terminal nodes in a hypergraph in a way that minimizes a sum of
penalties at split hyperedges. In our setup, different ways of splitting the
same hyperedge have different penalties, and the penalty is encoded by what we
call a splitting function.
</p>
<p>Our framework opens a rich space on the foundations of hypergraph cuts. We
first identify a natural class of cardinality-based hyperedge splitting
functions that depend only on the number of nodes on each side of the split. In
this case, we show that the general hypergraph $s$-$t$ cut problem can be
reduced to a tractable graph $s$-$t$ cut problem if and only if the splitting
functions are submodular. We also identify a wide regime of non-submodular
splitting functions for which the problem is NP-hard. We also analyze
extensions to multiway cuts with at least three terminal nodes and identify a
natural class of splitting functions for which the problem can be reduced in an
approximation-preserving way to the node-weighted multiway cut problem in
graphs, again subject to a submodularity property. Finally, we outline several
open questions on general hypergraph cut problems.

<b>Spoiler Alert: </b>This post has details from the final episodes of the HBO television series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)">Silicon Valley</a><br />
<br />
A few times I've gotten emails from people claiming they have shown P = NP and asking whether they should keep their algorithm a secret to protect the cryptography out there. My typical response is that they should use their algorithm to mine a few bitcoins and then get back to me.<br />
<br />
The fictional characters of Pied Piper faced this dilemma when they AI they created "developed a general solution to discrete log in polynomial time" with some nice complexity class diagrams in the background.<br />
<br />
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;" class="separator">

<br />
Pied Piper was about to roll out its new internet, a distributed network that communicated between cell phones based on a compression algorithm developed by Pied Piper's CEO. Rolling out the network would reveal even more advanced compression based on breaking discrete log. "If we cancel it or shut it down, then others will try to copy or reverse engineer everything that we've built ... Our launch has to fail, publicly and spectacularly."<br />
<br />
But here comes the P v NP dilemma: "And what about all the other stuff we're gonna do? I mean, give internet to underserved communities, students in the homework gap, refugees, genomic research. Pied Piper can help scientists cure cancer."<br />
<br />
I'd take broken encryption over cancer any day. You can still do encryption even if P = NP, one-time pads distributed via USB drives or quantum. And cancer sucks.<br />
<br />
They should have mined a few bitcoins.</div>

<div class="content" lang="en">
<p style="text-align: left;">Greetings from Oberwolfach.  This week, there is a great meeting here on combinatorics. In this post I want to state the Brown-Erdős-Sós conjecture and one of its variants. The trigger was a beautiful talk I heard from <a href="http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~liorgis1/">Lior Gishboliner</a> on some impressive progress toward this very difficult problem.  Yet the solution of the problem seems far, and some people even doubt if the conjecture is true. Here is the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08834">“A New Bound for the Brown-Erdős-Sós problem</a>” by David Conlon, Lior Gishboliner, Yevgeny Levanzov, and Asaf Shapira.</p>
<h2>The Brown-Erdős-Sós conjecture and strong versions</h2>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/pv.jpg"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/pv.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169" alt="" width="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-16790" height="169" /></a></p>
<p>Lior’s talk reminded me that Peter Frankl and Voita Rodl told me in the late 80s about strong variants of the Brown-Erdős-Sós problem that implies the Szemeredi theorem. With the kind help of Voita Rodl  who is here I can tell you about two such variants. (But I am solely responsible for all mistakes.)</p>
<p>Let <em>f(n,v,e)</em> be the largest number of edges in an 3-uniform hypergraph with <em>n</em> vertices and no v vertices spanning e edges or more.</p>
<p><strong>Brown-Erdős-Sós Conjecture:</strong> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28n%2Ce%2B3%2Ce%29%3Do%28n%5E2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f(n,e+3,e)=o(n^2)" class="latex" title="f(n,e+3,e)=o(n^2)" />, for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%5Cge+3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="e\ge 3" class="latex" title="e\ge 3" />.</p>
<p>For <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%3D3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="e=3" class="latex" title="e=3" /> the BES conjecture is the famous Ruzsa-Szemeredi theorem (that implies Roth’s theorem on 3-term arithmetic progressions). For <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%3D4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="e=4" class="latex" title="e=4" /> the conjecture is painfully open (and is stronger than Szemeredi theorem for 4-term APs).</p>
<p>Here is an even stronger conjectures that implies Szemeredi theorem arithmetic progressions of arbitrary length.</p>
<p>Consider the following 3-uniform hypergraph <em>H(v)</em> with<em> v+3</em> vertices and <em>v</em> edges: Start with a path with v+1 vertices (and v edges). Color the edges alternately with red and brown and add a red vertex and a brown vertex. Now form a 3-uniform hypergraph whose edges are the red edges of the path joined with the red vertex and the brown edges of the graph joined with the brown vertex.</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/szem-voita1.png"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/szem-voita1.png?w=300&amp;h=205" alt="" width="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-19110" height="205" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Conjecture:</strong> Every <em>H(v)</em>-free 3-uniform hypergraph with <em>n</em> vertices has <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%28n%5E2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="o(n^2)" class="latex" title="o(n^2)" /> vertices.</p>
<p>For another strengthening of the BES-conjecture that implies the Szemeredi theorem see the paper <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/search/publdoc.html?arg3=&amp;co4=AND&amp;co5=AND&amp;co6=AND&amp;co7=AND&amp;dr=all&amp;pg4=AUCN&amp;pg5=TI&amp;pg6=PC&amp;pg7=ALLF&amp;pg8=ET&amp;review_format=html&amp;s4=Rodl%20and%20Erdos&amp;s5=&amp;s6=&amp;s7=&amp;s8=All&amp;sort=Newest&amp;vfpref=html&amp;yearRangeFirst=&amp;yearRangeSecond=&amp;yrop=eq&amp;r=2&amp;mx-pid=1393704">A remark of Pisier-type theorems</a> of Erdos, Nesetril and Rodl. Famously, the celebrated hypergraph regularity lemma (and associated counting lemma) implies another Turan type theorem for hypergraphs that in turn implies Szemeredi’s theorem and its high dimensional extensions.</p>
<h2>The new bounds by Conlon, Gishboliner, Levanzov, and Shapira</h2>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/bes2.png"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/bes2.png?w=640&amp;h=173" alt="" width="640" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19114" height="173" /></a></p>
<p>Although the theorem is for 3-uniform hypergraph the proof relies on the hypergraph regularity lemma for higher dimensional hypergraphs.</p>

Larry David is an American comedian. He was the lead writer and producer of the <em>Seinfeld</em> TV series. During the previous and current election cycles he has played Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in skits on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. His “Bernie” rails about issues with passwords.</p>
<p>
Today I want to talk about reducing our dependence on passwords.</p>
<p>
On SNL in October 2015, his “Bernie” branched off the topic of Hillary Clinton’s e-mails to famously <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2015/this-snl-skit-starring-larry-david-as-bernie-sanders-claiming-to-be-bad-at-tech-is-a-big-youtube-hit/">rant</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> What’s the deal with e-mails anyway? I forgot my password the other day, so they say “We’ll email you a new one.” But I can’t get into my email to get the password. I mean, talk about a ball-buster. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
In the SNL <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/12/saturday-night-live-spoofs-democratic-debate-1202815760/">cold open</a> about the most recent debate three weeks ago, “Bernie” reprised the complaint:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Apple lies, Amazon lies, even my I-Phone lies. Every time it says it’s at 1 percent battery, it stays on for at least 20 minutes. The other times it’s at 7 percent—it shuts down immediately. Apple, what are you trying to hide? And what’s my password?!! </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Passwords are still needed. But, and this is the key, we wish to reduce our dependency on them and still be safe. Also the method fits nicely with today’s need for access to encrypted information by law enforcement. We have already discussed this recently <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/12/03/end-to-end-encryption-a-problem/">here</a>. The trick is to make information safe enough to please us, but not have as many passwords that we need to remember. “Bernie” would be happy. </p>
<p></p><p>
Let’s next review why we use passwords at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Why We Have Passwords </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Passwords have been used forever. See our friends at Wikipedia for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password">story</a> by Polybius, an ancient historian, on how eons ago the Roman military used watchwords. Passwords have been used since the beginning of computing, forever in our world, to safeguard computer systems. The MIT computer system, CTSS, used them starting in 1961 to protect users. This is the reason Fernando Corbató is credited with the invention of computer passwords. </p>
<p>
The goal of passwords and watchwords, is simple: Control access. Both the real and fake Bernies use e-mail passwords to keep their communications private. We try to select good passwords, but the management of them can be challenging. It’s not just that people like “Bernie” forget theirs—it’s that our efforts to keep them in our heads often make them too easy to figure out. Jimmy Kimmel showed this in a 2017 <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/jimmy-kimmel-gets-people-to-give-him-their-passwords/">segment</a> on his own show.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Passwords are Dead </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Managing passwords has lead to the theme, “passwords are dead.” If they are dead, then we must have alternative methods. Some are based on biometrics such as fingerprints and eye scans; others are based on additional hardware. Fingerprints are one of the most popular, but have major drawbacks: </p>
<ul>
<li>
They can be unreliable. <p></p>
</li><li>
They can be attacked. <p></p>
</li><li>
They cannot be changed.
</li></ul>
<p>I can attest that fingerprints are unreliable. I use a Global Pass to speed my re-entry into the US. After my flight arrives at the airport, I use a Global Pass machine that checks my fingerprints. The machine fails to recognize my fingerprints, every time. This forces me to talk to a custom agent and convince them am who I claim to be. Thus defeating the reason for using the Global Pass.</p>
<p>
A 2012 <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-817.html">study</a> by Joseph Bonneau, Cormac Herley, Paul Oorschot, and Frank Stajano tilted “The Quest to Replace Passwords” compared 35 alternatives to passwords on their security, usability, and deployability. They showed that most do better on security, many do better on usability. But all alternatives do worse on deployability. The authors conclude: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Marginal gains are often not sufficient to reach the activation energy necessary to overcome significant transition costs, which may provide the best explanation of why we are likely to live considerably longer before seeing the funeral procession for passwords arrive at the cemetery.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Colorful language, but the point is that passwords are hard to beat.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> How to Remove Them </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I have a proposal on how to avoid reliance on just passwords. At least for many applications. The idea is: You would use a password and add a secret password that you do not remember. You do not even know this password. You do not write it down. Clearly, this is additional security if you do not even know the secret password. No one can steal it from you or guess it.</p>
<p>
So the issue is: How do you access your own stuff without accessing the secret password? The answer is simple: You run a program that tries all the possibilities. Let this take some time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{T}" class="latex" title="{T}" />. This point is that for many situations you will not mind if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{T}" class="latex" title="{T}" /> is large. For example, when the access that you are protecting occurs rarely. The security that this affords is based on this: An attacker can and will definitely be able to get access by expending <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{T}" class="latex" title="{T}" /> time, if they also know you standard password. But this protects against mass attacks. An attacker may be able to get your data, but will not be able to get millions of people’s data.</p>
<p>
Let’s examine a few applications: </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>End-to-end Encryption:</i> The secret password could be protected by a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{T}" class="latex" title="{T}" /> of order years or even decades of computer time. This would allow law enforcement to get information it needs, while stopping causal attackers.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>Recovery of your data:</i> The secret password could be protected by a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{T}" class="latex" title="{T}" /> of order days of computer time. Your computer backup data is secured by such a password. Then it crashes. You need to run such a computation to recover the data. In many situations this would be fine.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>A banking site:</i> You would still use a good password. The extra secret one could have a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{T}" class="latex" title="{T}" /> of an hour say. Then when you need to pay an on-line bill, you would have to wait a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>Not need to place passwords in your will:</i> Omada King, in his 2013 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Identity-Passwords-Personal-Transformation/dp/1479781177">book</a> <em>The Making Identity</em>, wrote: </p>
<blockquote><p><em>[A]ccording to a recent survey from the University of London, one in ten people are now leaving their passwords in their wills to pass on this important information when they die. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
This could be avoided by using a secret password with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{T}" class="latex" title="{T}" /> of order <em>months</em>. When it is needed the heirs would run the recovery program and get the access they need.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Ken’s Words </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Ken points out that merely trying more than a few possibilities will usually generate a suspicious-activity message and usually a shutdown. So a system would have to be set up to permit “self-hacking.” Ken has a small rotation of “password extenders” not written down and often has to try two or three before gaining access to non-financial sites where he is registered.</p>
<p>
Ken is sometimes asked to monitor chess tournaments for possible cheating using the initial “screening” phase of his system. This phase requires minimal effort from Ken as it is supposed to be automated on a server that any chess tournament director would have quick access to, but for various reasons the International Chess Federation (FIDE) has not (yet) erected such a server. So Ken posts the auto-generated reports at a private location known only to him and the arbiter(s) of a particular tournament.</p>
<p>
Ken does not maintain a password scheme for the reports. This would become a headache precisely because of the difficulties people have with passwords. Ken does not want to assume the responsibility for managing them. Instead he includes a “quasi-password” as part of the URL he creates. These are often multi-lingual puns or references to quirky artists or factoids in the home country of the tournament. Being memorable and unusual enables the arbiter’s browser to learn the word and link without collision. </p>
<p>
This maximizes convenience: For Ken to e-mail reports or zipped folders as attachments would be cumbersome under daily updates. With Ken’s way, the arbiter can view updates even without having to pull up Ken’s previous e-mails with links, just by typing some letters of the weird word in the browser address bar. Hiding directory listings and a “no robots” directive completes minimal security for temporary use during the tournament.</p>
<p>
</p><h2> The First and Last Word? </h2><p></p>
<p>We mentioned Fernando Corbató having originated passwords.  But before his passing last July 12, he came to regret them.  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/despite-data-thefts-the-password-endures-1400725381">Here</a> he is quoted:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“It’s become a kind of nightmare.  I don’t think anybody can possibly remember all the passwords.”
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
How practical do you find the “no-password” idea? At least the above suggestion may save us from having to place passwords in our wills. </p>

<div style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">For someone based in the UK who works in any kind of international market, it looks reasonable to consider how his business strategy should be affected by leaving the EU. In the case of CS theory research, this perhaps runs counter to an idealised view in which all research is global, and should not be affected by squalid political considerations. The interest inherent in any specific problem or result ought to be independent of where it was studied. On a related note, it may be felt that it’s the research topic that chooses the researcher, not the researcher who chooses the topic. On the other hand, even in CS theory, ones political environment and associated social networks may have a stronger effect than we would like to acknowledge.<br /><br />When I was a graduate student, Algorithms and Computational Complexity was relatively under-represented in the UK, compared with today. The UK theory community was dominated by so-called “Euro-theory”, which at the time did not seem to exhibit obvious points of contact with algorithms research. People like me had to look west for assurance that our research was of wider interest than what was apparent in our own backyard. To further justify that west-looking approach, it was clear that the USA was, in terms of research, the undisputed world leader. Then as now, it collected the lion’s share of Nobel prizes. It had industrial research labs producing leading CS theory research, such as IBM, AT&amp;T, and NEC, while Europe had nothing similar. For me, this sowed the seeds of a defiantly Atlanticist attitude to CS theory research — appropriate for Brexit Britain, perhaps? — that the best way to pursue high-quality research was via links with colleagues in the USA.<br /><br />Fast-forward to about five years ago, and my attitude had softened. The UK’s algorithms-and-complexity community steadily grew, and is much larger than it was in the early 90’s. Travel within Europe is relatively quick and cheap, with no visa issues. The European research community became a bit of a comfort-zone, while the USA’s research ethic seemed comparatively intense and high-pressure. The perennial question of “Where’s my next STOC/FOCS paper going to come from?” has always seemed less urgent in Europe.<br /><br />The EU has attempted to unify Europe’s academic research activity, which is supported by diverse governments, and gives rise to diverse complaints among European colleagues. I am reminded of the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karenina_principle">unhappy families</a>” quote from <i>Anna Karenina</i>. In an attempt to give it a bit of unity, there’s some EU funding for research, concerning which we have this criticism from <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/geim_lecture.pdf">Andre Geim’s Nobel prize speech</a>:  “I can offer no nice words for the EU Framework programmes which, except for the  European Research Council, can be praised only by Europhobes for discrediting the whole idea of an effectively working Europe.” For my part, I recently tried to get a grant from the European Research Council but they turned me down. If I were a rational agent, I should at this point be one of Geim’s Europhobes; of course in reality things are not quite so simple. But at this point I reckon the US research funding system looks like the least worst. <a href="http://occamstypewriter.org/athenedonald/2019/12/16/post-election-christmas-reading-list/">A recent article</a> at Athene Donald’s blog discusses the post-EU era and the idea of a DARPA-like research agency for the UK.<br /><br />So, leaving the EU looks like an opportune point to dust off the above-mentioned “Atlanticist attitude”. These days China is also becoming more important. But I hope that Europe will not give up on us, but will compete strenuously with them for our attention.</div></div>

I recently needed to look at what NP problems were possibly intermediary (neither in P nor NP-complete). So I went to Wikipedia and found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-intermediate">this</a>.<br />
<br />
They had many problems, though some I had never heard of. Those that I had never heard of<br />
<br />
<i>should they be on the list?</i><br />
<i><br />
</i> That is, are they natural? That is hard to define rigorously, but I will take you through my train of thought as I read the first few:<br />
<br />
<b>Factoring Integers</b>. Yes, quite possibly intermediary: If  its NPC then PH collapses, and, at least so far, does not seem to be in P.  (the NPC--&gt; PH collapse result: We take<br />
<br />
FACT = { (n,x) : n has a nontrivial factor ≤ x }<br />
<br />
FACT is clearly in NP:<br />
a complete factorization of n provides evidence that some nontrivial factor is \le x.<br />
<br />
FACT is clearly in coNP:<br />
a complete factorization of n provides evidence that no nontrivial factor is \le x<br />
<br />
so if FACT is NP-complete then SAT is in coNP.<br />
<br />
Factoring is clearly an important and well studied problem. It even has its own Wikipedia entry!<br />
<br />
<b>Discrete Log</b>. Similar to Factoring. And it is also an important and well studied problem. It even has its own Wikipedia Entry!<br />
<br />
<b>Isomorphism Problems</b> They list Group and Ring isomorphism. They don't list Graph, which is odd. (ADDED LATER- my bad, they do mention Graph Isom in the section on Graph Algorithms) Anyway, if Graph Isom is NPC then PH collapses, and, at least so far, there is no algorithm for Graph Isom in P. (I do not think it is know if Group Isom NPC means PH collapses, or if Ring Isom NPC means PH collapses---if you know of such a proof leave a comment and a pointer to it.)<br />
<br />
Graph Isomorphism is a well studied problem and seems important and natural (I don't know if Graph Isomorphism has any real applications they way that factoring and DL do).  It even has its own Wikipedia entry! Group and Ring Isomorphism also seem important and natural. And they have their own Wikipedia entry!<br />
<br />
<b>Numbers in Boxes Problem </b>My first reaction-Gee, whats that? For the Factoring, DL, and Isomorphism they did not define the problem-- they gave pointers to the Wikipedia entries on them. For this one there was no Wikipedia entry. There was one reference. I went to it. <i>It was a blog entry of mine</i>! Here it is: <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2010/07/what-is-complexity-of-these-problems.html">her</a>e, and to save you time I'll say what it is:<br />
<br />
{ (1<sup>n</sup>,1<sup>k</sup>) : you can partition 1,...,n into k boxes so that no box has x,y,z with x + y = z }<br />
<br />
Is this problem important? Does it exist anywhere outside of my blog entry? Yes--- a special case of it was in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Eccos-Cyberpuzzles-Dennis-Shasha/dp/0393325415/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=Dr.+Ecco&amp;qid=1577931523&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2">Dr. Ecco's Cyperpuzzles by Dennis Shasha</a> (note- Dennis was a classmate of mine in graduate school at Harvard). I think the case was to try to partition {1,...,100} as best you can. Actually I first saw the case of the problem in his book and then generalized it.<br />
<br />
The problem is sparse so if it was NP-complete then P = NP, very good evidence that its not NPC. And its been studied for thousands of years, with people looking for poly time algorithms (I think Pythagoras studied it) without success, so its almost surely not in P. OR that last sentence was complete nonsense. Indeed, I don't think anyone has studied the problem computationally, or, for that matter, at all. So the evidence that its not in P is... sparse.<br />
<br />
But its worse than that. One could devise MANY sparse problems that are, since spares, likely NOT NPC, and hardly studied, so as-of-now, not in P. Should those count? Only if (a) more people study them so there is an attempt to point to to get it into P, and (b) the problem is natural (which is hard to define).<br />
<br />
Note that I can vary the problem: x+2y=z (this relates to lower bounds on VDW numbers)<br />
or any other combination of x,y,z or more that I like.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This raises a question:<br />
<br />
<b>When is a problem worthy of being put on lists of problems?</b><br />
<b><br />
</b> Here are some possibly criteria. One can take ANDS and ORS of them.<br />
<br />
1) The problem has a Wikipedia entry. This might fall victim to Goodhearts law: when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a measure.  That is, I could make a Wikipedia entry on the Number-in-boxes problem and then say LOOK, its on Wikipedia!<br />
<br />
2) More than X people have worked on the problem for some value of X. But here is a reason this might not be a good criteria: look at the problem<br />
<br />
{ α : α is a reg expression that allows numbers (so a<sup>1000</sup> is fine, makes reg expressions  VERY succint) such that L(α)=Σ<sup>*</sup> }<br />
<br />
This problem looks natural, and was proven by Meyer and Stockmeyer to be EXPSPACE complete.<br />
That is the only paper on this problem, yet the problem really does look natural, and the result is rightly celebrated as a natural problem that is provably not in P.<br />
<br />
3) When people in the field look at the problem they say YEAH, thats a good problem.<br />
<br />
4) The problem relates to other problems or other fields.<br />
<br />
I doubt the Number-in-boxes problem satisfies any of these criteria. The variant with x+2y=z relates to Ramsey Theory. Great.<br />
<br />
NOW, back to the list-- I won't go through any more on the list, but I note that for some of them the only reference seems to be a conversation on stack-exchange.  Some of those end up referring to real papers so are more likely natural, but some do not.<br />
<br />
Having said that, is there any harm in the list having on it some problems that are not ... worthy? Is that even the right word to use?<br />
<br />
Note that I don't have strong opinions on any of these matters, I am just wondering what criteria Wikipedia, and other sources, uses, when they have lists of problems.<br />

<p>Happy new year! And now for the last post of 2019 papers. We have found a diverse collection of six papers, ranging from classic property testing topics to new perspectives on sublinear computation. </p>



<p><strong>Sublinear Optimal Policy Value Estimation in Contextual Bandits</strong> by Weihao Kong, Gregory Valiant, Emma Brunskill (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06111">arXiv</a>). This isn’t our usual sublinear paper, but it is definitely of interest to us sublinear folk. Let’s start with a stripped down definition of the problem (or rather, game). There are \(K\) “arms”, where the \(i\)th arm is represented by an unknown vector in \(\beta_i \in \mathbb{R}^d\). We are presented with a “context”, which is a vector \(x \in \mathbb{R}^d\). Our job is to choose an arm \(i \in [K]\). We get the reward \(x \cdot \beta_i\) (with some noise added). The contexts appears from a known distribution. To aid us, we observe the rewards of \(N\) iid contexts, so we observe a total of \(T = KN\) rewards. There has been much work on figuring out the minimum value of \(T\) required to learn the optimal policy. One requires at least \(d\) (the dimension) samples to estimate any of the arm vectors. This papers shows that one can actually estimate the expected reward of the optimal policy, without being able to describe it, with sublinear in \(d\) (technically, \(\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d})\)) samples. We see this a lot in property testing, where producing the “optimal” solution for a problem requires linear-in-dimension samples, but estimating the optimal value is much cheaper (consider, for example, the situation of linearity testing, where we wish to find the closest linear function).</p>



<p><strong>Sublinear Time Numerical Linear Algebra for Structured Matrices </strong>by Xiaofei Shi and David P. Woodruff (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.06060.pdf">arXiv</a>). This follows the recent linear of advances in sublinear time linear algebra. Given a matrix \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}\), the aim is to get algorithms that only look at \(o(nnz(A))\) entries (where \(nnz(A)\) is the number of non-zeroes, or the support). Consider the classic talk of low rank approximation. Unfortunately, suppose one entry is extremely large, and the others are extremely small. One has to find this large entry for any reasonable approximation, which (in the worst-case) requires \(nnz(A)\) queries into \(A\). Thus, previous papers make structural assumption (such as, \(A\) being a Vandermonde matrix) to get sublinear bounds. This paper gives a clean black box method to get a variety of such results. Basically, one can replace the usual \(nnz(A)\) term in many algorithms, by \(T(A)\), which is the time to compute the matrix-vector product \( Ay\), for \(y \in \mathbb{R}^d\). In many cases \(T(A) = \widetilde{O}(n)\), which can be significantly smaller than \(nnz(A)\). This paper gives such results for low-rank approximations and many regression problems.</p>



<p><strong>Robust and Sample Optimal Algorithms for PSD Low-Rank Approximation</strong> by Ainesh Bakshi, Nadiia Chepurko, and David P. Woodruff. Consider the low rank problem discussed above. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, we need structural assumptions on \(A\). Previous results gave sublinear time low-rank approximations assuming that \(A\) is positive semidefinite (PSD). The aim is to get a rank \(k\) matrix \(B\) such that \(\|A-B\|^2_2\) is at most \((1+\epsilon)\)-times the optimal such approximation. The previous algorithm of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03371">Musco-Woodruff</a> makes \(\widetilde{O}(nk/\epsilon^{2.5})\) queries in to \(A\), while there is a lower bound of \(\Omega(nk/\epsilon)\). This gap between the complexities is resolved in this paper with an upper bound of \(\widetilde{O}(nk/\epsilon)\) queries.</p>



<p><strong>Constructive derandomization of query algorithms </strong>by Guy Blanc, Jane Lange, and Li-Yang Tan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03042">arXiv</a>). This paper discusses an intriguing angle to sublinear question: when can they be derandomized? Abstractly, consider a randomized algorithm \(R\) that makes \(q\) queries. Think of \(R\) as a function \(R(x,r)\), where \(x\) is the input, and \(r\) is the randomness. We would like to design a deterministic algorithm \(D\) making, ideally, close to \(q\) queries and approximates \(\mathop{E}_r[R(x,r)]\). For starters, consider some distribution over \(x\), and suppose we want \(\mathbb{E}_x[D(x) – \mathbb{E}_r[R(x,r)]] &lt; \epsilon\). By (the easy direction of) Yao’s minimax lemma, one can show the existence of such an algorithm \(D\) that makes \(O(q/\epsilon)\) queries. But how to explicitly construct it? Indeed, the first result of this paper gives a “meta-algorithm” that takes as input the description of \(R\) (which is of size \(N\)), has running time \(poly(N)2^{O(q/\epsilon)}\) and outputs a description of \(D\). When \(R\) satisfies the stronger property of “bounded error”, one can get a \(O(q^3)\)-query algorithm \(D\) that approximates \(\mathop{E}_r[R(x,r)]\) for all \(x\) (again, the existence is proven by a classic theorem of Nisan). Overall, this paper gives a method to derandomize sublinear time algorithms, and I wonder if there could be some applications of this method for proving lower bounds. After all, Yao’s minimax theorem is <em>the</em> tool for property testing lower bounds, and any perspective on Yao’s theorem is likely of relevance. </p>



<p><strong>Testing Membership for Timed Automata</strong> by Richard Lassaigne and Michel de Rougemont (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08277">arXiv</a>). Property testing for regular languages is a classic result in sublinear algorithms. This paper focuses on the more complex notion of timed automata. The technical definition is quite complicated, but here’s an overview. There is a finite automaton and a collection of “clocks”. Imagine a string being processed, where each alphabet symbol appears with a new timestamp. Thus, the input word is called a “timed word”. The transitions of the automaton involve the new symbol read, as well as constraints involving the clock times and the timestamp. Thus, we can enforce conditions like “only transition if another symbol is read within a single time unit”. In general, deciding whether a timed word is accepted by a timed automaton is NP-complete. This papers studies the property testing viewpoint. The paper gives a new definition of “timed edit distance” between timed words. The main result shows that one can distinguish time words accepted by a timed automaton from words that are far (according to timed edit distance), by querying a constant number of word positions.</p>



<p><strong>On the query complexity of estimating the distance to hereditary graph properties</strong> by Carlos Hoppen, Yoshiharu Kohayakawa, Richard Lang, Hanno Lefmann, and Henrique Stagni (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01081">arXiv</a>). This paper concerns the classic setting of property testing of dense graphs. It is well-known that all hereditary graph properties are testable, and are moreover, one can estimate the distance to the property in time that only depends on \(\varepsilon\). Unfortunately, the queries complexities have large tower dependencies on \(\varepsilon\), arising from the use of the Szemeredi regularity lemma. The question of property testing in dense graphs can be reduced to finding “removal” lemmas (such as the classic triangle remove lemma). Such a lemma states that if at least \(\varepsilon n^2\) edges need to be removed from \(G\) to destroy all “forbidden subgraphs”, then there must be “many” forbidden subgraphs in \(G\). There is much recent research on finding families of forbidden subgraphs, where the “many” (in the above statement) is at least \(poly(\varepsilon)\) times  the trivial upper bound. This paper shows that one can also estimate the distance to any hereditary property, in a query complexity that depends directly on the corresponding removal lemma parameters. As a compelling example, one can estimate the distance to being chordal in \(\exp(1/\varepsilon)\) queries, a significant improvement over standard tower bounds.</p></div>

<p>M. Night Shyamalan is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Night_Shyamalan">creator</a> of many wonderful horror movies, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Village_(2004_film)">The Village</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sixth_Sense">The Sixth Sense</a>. His films often have a twist ending.</p>
<p>
Today I thought I would try to apply math and logic to his latest creation, the TV show called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_(TV_series)">Servant</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-16522"></span></p>
<p>
I am not kidding. No number theory, no complexity theory, no strange theorems today. I thought I would try and apply some logic to attempt and understand M. Night’s story. The story was created by Tony Basgallop but M. Night’s direction modulates what we can see and how we feel it. <em>Servant</em> is on cable, on Apple TV, and is close to the end. It is a series of ten short episodes and the last two are due out in the next few days. </p>
<p>
The story is strange, scary, and unusual. M. Night likes to play with his viewers and make stories that are difficult to understand. Like many of our problems: Think P=NP or the Riemann Hypothesis, or the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3x%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{3x+1}" class="latex" title="{3x+1}" /> function problem. Our problems are strange, scary, and unusual too. Our difficulty is that we do not have a date when all will be explained. As we discussed <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/12/22/predicting-when-pnp-is-resolved/">here</a>, we might be waiting a long time before we get the “last” episode for P=NP, for example.</p>
<p>
Take a look at the rest even if you have not watched the series. I would like to think that working out the “solution” to the Servant is possible, but probably hard. I am not likely to have the answer here, but I think I may be on the right track, at least.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Story in Short </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Here is a brief <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_(TV_series)">summary</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Six weeks after the death of their 13-week-old son, Philadelphia couple Dorothy and Sean Turner hire a young nanny, Leanne, to move in and take care of Baby Jericho, a reborn doll. The doll, which Dorothy believes is her real child, was the only thing that brought her out of her catatonic state following Jericho’s death. While Sean deals with the grief on his own, he becomes deeply suspicious of Leanne. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The players are: </p>
<ul>
<li>
The baby, Jericho. <p></p>
</li><li>
The mom, Dorothy <p></p>
</li><li>
The dad, Sean. <p></p>
</li><li>
The brother, Julian. <p></p>
</li><li>
The nanny, Leanne.
</li></ul>
<p>
I like this statement about <a href="https://netflixlife.com/2019/12/28/servant-s1e7-darkest-theory-jericho/">Servant</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <em>Servant</em> continues to frighten viewers while at the same time not providing audiences with answers. But have they been telling us more than we know? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> On-line Comments </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Like P=NP there is much debate and discussion about <em>Servant</em>. Here is a typical comment: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Never mind the mystery of whether Jericho is truly alive again or not, there’s also the fact that we have no idea how he died in the first place. New theory is that Dorothy killed him, either on accident or due to a bad postpartum depression episode. This would mean Julian and Sean covered it up. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
There are lots of details in the story that may or may not be important. There are many theories about what could be going on. One thing seems clear is that what is happening is mystery. Is it one that we can shed any light on?</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Jericho is the Key </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The discussions on-line about what is happening seem to miss the key: Is the baby, Jericho, a plastic baby or a real baby? Most seem to accept that the baby was plastic and then was replaced by a real baby. This is where I can apply logical analysis. Let’s walk through the possible cases:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Perhaps Jericho is a magical object. Than the whole story is a dream. Or the players are ghosts. Or some other magical possibility. This reflects the fact that we do not have precise rules or axioms. M. Night could do anything he wishes. But I like to think that he plays by some rules. So let’s agree that this case is out.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Perhaps Jericho was a plastic baby at first and then became a real baby. This is the consensus of almost all viewers. At least if we can rely on their comments. The issue here is how does this work? How can a living baby suddenly appear? How can the mom and the nanny not notice the baby has become real? </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Perhaps Jericho was always a plastic baby. This seems to not be considered as a plausible case. It does require that the father and the brother are crazy. I like this idea. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Perhaps Jericho was always a real baby. This seems to be the most unusual idea. I think M. Night might like this direction. It would be the biggest twist. The baby was always real. Here M. Night is laughing at us: he would get the biggest shock if Jericho is always real. It would explain much. Then the mom and the nanny are just fine, we do not need to assume that they are crazy at all. Then the father and the brother are nuts. </p>
<p>
I think the last is my favorite. I wish I could “prove” that the last is the case. In a few days we should know what M. Night selected for the answer. I feel that our methods at least forced us to consider all the logical possibilities. Is this the right answer?</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I hope you did not mind this diversion from hard core math. I think that applying logic may be useful here. Too bad we do not have a reveal date for our problems like P=NP.</p>
<p></p></font></font></div>

<p><a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/1/241717-publish-and-perish/fulltext">Moshe Vardi’s latest insight in the Communications of the ACM </a>(whose title we adopt for this post) agrees with our previous post “<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2019/08/04/because-of-pollution-conferences-should-be-virtual/">Because of pollution, conferences should be virtual.</a>” Vardi calls for “sweeping policy change […] requiring that authors of accepted papers that must fly to  participate in a conference may opt out from in-person involvement and  contribute instead by video.”  Vardi gives some indication of the environmental impact of the travel-based system, and further suspects that in-person conference participation is “much less valuable than we would like to believe.”</p>



<p>These issues are closely related to the decades-old discussion of journals vs. conferences. <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/tag/utopia/">Several older posts on this blog </a>were devoted to that. Lance Fortnow, back in 2009, wrote that it’s <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/8/34492-viewpoint-time-for-computer-science-to-grow-up/abstract">Time for computer science to grow up</a>.  The full text of this article is premium content, but you can read a pre-publication version <a href="http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/~fortnow/papers/growup.pdf">here</a>. Basically, he argues in favor of a journal-based publication system.</p>



<p>Apparently in response, judging from the title, Boaz Barak wrote a piece titled <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/6/202644-computer-science-should-stay-young/abstract">Computer science should stay young.</a> I can’t quickly find a link to the whole thing, but his bottom line is online “I disagree with the conclusion that we should transition to a classical journal-based model similar to that of other fields. I believe conferences offer a number of unique advantages that have helped make computer science dynamic and successful, and can continue to do so in the future.”</p>



<p>I disagree that conferences are young. They belong to the BI (before internet) era, and so look rather anchored in the past to me.  Historically, I also suppose in-person discussion predates writing, though this is irrelevant.  What is young is the health impact of pollution (Fortnow and Barak’s pieces don’t touch on health issues). (By health impact I include climate change, but I prefer not to use that term for various reasons.)</p>



<p>And what is young and cool is arxiv overlay journals, TCS+ talks, videoconferences,  <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/">ECCC</a>, etc.</p>



<p>Instead, we impose on our community most inconvenient transoceanic flights.  To end I’ll quote from <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/MC/269.html">Oded Goldreich’s my choices</a>:</p>



<p><b>Phoenix in June:</b> […] One must be out of their mind to hold a conference under such weather conditions. I guess humans can endure such weather conditions and even worse ones, but why choose to do so? Why call upon people from all over the world to travel to one of the least comfortable locations (per the timing)?</p>

We establish an exactly tight relation between reversible pebblings of graphs and Nullstellensatz refutations of pebbling formulas, showing that a graph $G$ can be reversibly pebbled in time $t$ and space $s$ if and only if there is a Nullstellensatz refutation of the pebbling formula over $G$ in size $t+1$ and degree $s$ (independently of the field in which the Nullstellensatz refutation  is made). We use this correspondence to prove a number of strong size-degree trade-offs for Nullstellensatz, which to the best of our   knowledge are the first such results for this proof system.</div>

Ben Orlin is a funny mathematician. His <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Change-Only-Constant-Wisdom-Calculus/dp/0316509086/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=math0b2-20&amp;linkId=4b0342416ae54d5080032b8cc09bfc93&amp;language=en_US">book</a> title <i>Change Is the Only Constant</i> was <a href="https://math-frolic.blogspot.com/2019/12/books-closing-out-2019-with-some-faves.html">selected</a> by the blog <em>Math-Frolic</em> as the best mathematics book of 2019.</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I want to try to get you to at least smile, if not laugh.</p>
<p>
Orlin is a funny chap—okay I just got back from London—so forgive me for using “chap”. Check Orlin’s site out for <a href="https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2015/12/30/a-mathematicians-new-years-resolutions/">proof</a> that he is funny. Here are some of his <a href="https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2017/09/13/literatures-greatest-opening-lines-as-written-by-mathematicians/">examples</a> of math types rewriting famous opening lines from books. We will make this into a kind of quiz. You must guess the book title from the modified quote:</p>
<ol>
<li>
The times had high variance. <p></p>
</li><li>
Up to isomorphism there is one happy family. <p></p>
</li><li>
It was a bright cold day, and the clocks were not mod 12. <p></p>
</li><li>
All this happened, but not with equality. <p></p>
</li><li>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E2+%5Ccdot+31%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^2 \cdot 31}" class="latex" title="{2^2 \cdot 31}" /> was spiteful, full of a baby’s venom. <p></p>
</li><li>
It was zero at the leading ordinal of viewing.
</li></ol>
<p>
The third is the first hard one—I did not get it. The last one (of three from Ken not Ben) is probably unfair. All six of them, however, are on the “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-Lines-Literature-Coffee-Slaughterhouse/dp/B01D6TGVHW">First Lines Literature Coffee Mug</a>” which Ken received a year ago as a Christmas present from his sister. I did not know this when I chose the first three.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Orlin’s Resolutions </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Many of us make resolutions for the new year. Here are some examples from Orlin:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Be better at explaining what I do to family and friends. I, Dick, have trouble with this one.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Not to prove by contradiction what can be proved directly. Assume that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2B1+%5Cneq+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1+1 \neq 2}" class="latex" title="{1+1 \neq 2}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /></p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Stop using the word “obviously.” Here at GLL we try to avoid this, at least when it is not obvious. We <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/02/28/phrases-that-drive-me-crazy/">posted</a> about phrases to avoid a year ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Our Resolutions </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Here are some of ours:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Stop doubting quantum computer claims. Unless, adds Ken, you have a possible concrete way of challenging them…</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Start trying to apply AI methods to complexity theory. Could there be a new learning approach to 3-SAT? Note that PAC learning kind-of came from there. See for instance the end of <a href="https://elmos.scripts.mit.edu/mathofdeeplearning/2017/05/08/mathematics-of-deep-learning-lecture-4/">this</a>.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Stop trying to understand proofs that Peano arithmetic is inconsistent. I still do not understand what logic they use to prove that Peano is inconsistent. What if that logic is inconsistent? </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Start up some fundamental research ideas and attempts on hard problems again.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> And try to make GLL better, including making it appeal to a wider community. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The answers are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<em>A Tale of Two Cities</em> by Charles Dickens: “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.” <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>Anna Karenina</em> by Leo Tolstoy: “Happy families are alike; every unhappy family is unlike in its own way.” <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>1984</em> by George Orwell: “It was a bright cold day, and the clocks were striking thirteen.” <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em> by Kurt Vonnegut: “All this happened, more or less.” <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>Beloved</em> by Toni Morrison, who died this year: “124 was spiteful, full of a baby’s venom.” This <a href="https://www.shmoop.com/quotes/124-was-spiteful.html">explanation</a> of the line continues: “We know all about numbers being spiteful. We took high school algebra. We’ve experienced the pain. But in this instance, the quote isn’t actually referring to a number. There’s not some mysterious mathematical entity that’s come to wreak havoc on the characters in our story. Here, ‘124’ refers to…” <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>Lolita</em> by Vladimir Nabokov: “It was love at first sight…” But wait—this is not the first line of the novel. The first line is maybe not suitable for a coffee mug or family-friendly blog. Instead it is the first line of chapter 29 of part II. We did say it was unfair. <b>Update: Oops</b>—as noted <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/12/31/resolutions-for-2020/#comment-107459">here</a>, it is the first line of <em>Catch-22</em> by Joseph Heller.  Maybe Ken’s Google engine shares his tendency toward chess-playing authors…
</li></ol>
<p>
Have a happy new year, and make some fun resolutions. Please let us know some of them, or ideas for ours.</p>
<p></p><p><br />

They all appear to generate random tree-like mazes in a square grid, but with different probability distributions on the trees. E.g. Kruskal and Prim generate minimum spanning trees for random weights, different from the uniformly random trees of Aldous–Broder and Wilson, and many others appear quite different from both.

As we move into the 2020s, we tend to look back and look forward. The 2010s will go down as the decade computing and data transformed society, for better and worse. Google turned 21 this year as its OG leadership stepped down. I turned 21 in 1984, but 1984 seems closer than ever.</div>

Last year we ended the <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2018/12/complexity-year-in-review-2018.html">year in review</a> by </div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
We end the year with craziness, the stock market is going through wild gyrations, we have a partial government shutdown including all of NSF and an uncertain political landscape with different parties leading the two houses of congress.

2019 was not quiet and we're about to head into an impeachment trial, Brexit and a critical US presidential election. The real challenges of the twenties will come from massive transformation from automation, climate change and deepening divisions in our society.

We significantly strengthen and generalize the theorem lifting Nullstellensatz degree to monotone span program size by Pitassi and  Robere (2018) so that it works for any gadget with high enough rank, in particular, for useful gadgets such as  equality and greater-than. We apply our generalized theorem to solve two open problems:

* We present the first result that demonstrates a separation in proof power for cutting planes with unbounded versus polynomially bounded    coefficients.
Specifically, we exhibit CNF formulas that can be refuted in quadratic length and constant line space in cutting planes with unbounded coefficients, but for which there are no refutations in subexponential length and subpolynomial line space if coefficients are restricted to be of polynomial magnitude.

* We give the first explicit separation between monotone Boolean formulas and monotone real formulas. Specifically, we give an explicit family of functions that can be computed with monotone real formulas of nearly linear size but require monotone Boolean formulas of exponential size. Previously only a non-explicit separation was known.  
  
An important technical ingredient, which may be of independent interest, is that we show that the Nullstellensatz degree of refuting the pebbling formula over a DAG $G$ over any field coincides exactly with the reversible pebbling price of $G$. 
In particular, this implies that the standard decision tree complexity and the parity  decision tree complexity of the corresponding falsified clause search problem are equal.</div>

<p>I am in <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tau-theory-fest/home">Tel Aviv Theory Fest</a> this week – a fantastic collection of talks and workshops organized by Yuval Filmus , Gil Kalai, Ronen Eldan, and Muli Safra.</p>



<p>It was a good chance to catch up with many friends and colleagues. In particular I met Elchanan Mossel and Subhash Khot, who asked me to serve as a “witness” for their bet on the unique games conjecture. I am recording it here so we can remember it a decade from noe.</p>



<p>Specifically, Elchanan bets that the Unique Games conjecture will be proven in the next decade – sometime between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2029 there will be a paper uploaded to the arxiv with a correct proof of the conjecture. Subhash bets that this won’t happen. They were not sure what to bet on, but eventually agreed to take my offer that the loser will have to collaborate on a problem chosen by the winner, so I think science will win in either case. (For what it’s worth, I think there is a good chance that Subhash will lose the bet because he himself will prove the UGC in this decade, though it’s always possible Subhash can both win the bet and prove the UGC if he manages to do it by tomorrow <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /> )</p>

<p>The conference itself is, as I mentioned, wonderful with an amazing collection of speakers.  Let me mention just a couple of talks from this morning. Shafi Goldwasser talked about “Law and Algorithms”. There is a recent area of research studying how to regulate algorithms, but Shafi’s talk focused mostly on the other direction: how algorithms and cryptography can help achieve legal objectives such as the “right to be forgotten” or the ability to monitor secret proceedings such as wiretap requests. </p>



<p>Christos Papadimitriou  talked about “Language, Brain, and Computation”.  Christos is obviously excited about understanding the language mechanisms in the brain. He said that studying the brain gives him the same feeling that you get when you sit in a coffee shop in Cambridge and hear intellectual discussions all around you: you don’t understand why everyone is not dropping everything they are doing and come here. (Well, his actual words were “sunsets over the Berkeley hills” but I think the Cambridge coffee shops are a better metaphor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /> )</p>

<p>I started out this decade with the project of writing a survey of the multi-armed bandit literature, which I had read thoroughly during the graduate studies that I was about to finish. At the time we resisted the temptation to name the survey “modern banditology”, which was indeed the right call given how much this “modern” picture has evolved over the decade! It is truly wonderful to now end the decade with two new iterations on the work we did in that survey: </p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://tor-lattimore.com/downloads/book/book.pdf" class="lipdf">Bandit algorithms</a> by Tor Lattimore and Csaba Szepesvari</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07272" class="liinternal">Introduction to bandits</a> by Alex Slivkins</li>
</ol>
<p>These new references very significantly expand the 2012 survey, and they are wonderful starting points for anyone who wants to enter the field.</p>
<p>Here are some of the discoveries in the world of bandits that stood out for me this decade:</p>
<ol>
<li>We now understand very precisely Thompson Sampling, the first bandit strategy that was proposed back in 1933. The most beautiful reference here is the one by Dan Russo and Ben Van Roy: <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume17/14-087/14-087.pdf" class="lipdf">An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Thompson Sampling</a>, JMLR 2016. Another one that stands out is <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v23/agrawal12/agrawal12.pdf" class="lipdf">Analysis of thompson sampling for the multi-armed bandit problem</a> by S. Agrawal and N. Goyal at COLT 2012.</li>
<li>T^{2/3} lower bound for  *non-stochastic* bandit with switching cost by Dekel, Ding, Koren and Peres at <u><font color="#000121"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2997" class="liinternal">STOC 201</a></font></u><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2997" class="liinternal">4</a>. This is a striking result for several reasons. In particular the proof has to be based on a non-trivial stochastic process, since for the classical stochastic i.i.d. model one can obtain \sqrt{T} (very easily in fact). </li>
<li>We now know that bandit convex optimization is “easy”, in the sense that it is a \sqrt{T}-regret type problem. What’s more is that in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03084" class="liinternal">STOC 2017 paper</a> with Y.T. Lee and R. Eldan we introduced a new way to do function estimation based on bandit feedback, using kernels (I have written at length about this on <a href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2016/08/06/kernel-based-methods-for-bandit-convex-optimization-part-1/" class="liinternal">this blog</a>).</li>
<li>A very intriguing model of computation for contextual bandit was proposed, where one can access the policy space only through an offline optimization oracle. With such access, the classical Exp4 algorithm cannot be simulated, and thus one needs new strategies. We now have a reasonable understanding that \sqrt{T} is doable with mild assumptions (see e.g. this ICML 2014 paper on “<u><font color="#000117"><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0555" class="liexternal">Taming the Monster</a></font>“</u> by Agarwal, Hsu, Kale, Langford, L. Li and Schapire) and that it is impossible with no assumptions (work of Hazan and Koren at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02089" class="liinternal">STOC 2016</a>).</li>
<li>Honorable mentions also go to the work of Wei and Luo showing that very strong variation bounds are possible in bandits (see this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03265" class="liinternal">COLT 2018 paper</a>), and Zimmert and Seldin who made striking progress on the best of both worlds phenomenon that we discovered with Slivkins at the beginning of the decade (I blogged about it <a href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2019/06/10/amazing-progress-in-adversarially-robust-stochastic-multi-armed-bandits/" class="liinternal">here</a> already).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Life beyond bandits</h2>
<p>In addition to starting the decade with the bandit survey, I also started it with being bored with the bandit topic altogether. I thought that many (if not most) of the fundamental results were now known, and it was a good idea to move on to something else. Obviously I was totally wrong, as you can see with all the works cited above (and many many more for stochastic bandits, including much deeper understanding of best arm identification, a topic very close to my heart, see e.g., <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume17/kaufman16a/kaufman16a.pdf" class="lipdf">[Kaufmann, Cappe, Garivier, JMLR 16]</a>). In fact I am now optimistic that there is probably another decade-worth of exploration left for the bandit problem(s). Nevertheless I ventured outside, and explored the world of optimization (out of which first came <a href="http://sbubeck.com/Bubeck15.pdf" class="lipdf">a survey</a>, and more recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAPSKVSdi0oZPbS-UD_kwT4ePZQx_CiME" class="liinternal">video lectures</a>) and briefly networks (another <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03511" class="liinternal">modest survey</a> came out of this too). </p>
<p>Here are some of the landmark optimization results of this decade in my view:</p>
<ol>
<li>Perhaps the most striking result of the decade in optimization is the observation that for finite sum problems, one can reduce the variance in stochastic gradient descent by somehow centering the estimates (e.g., using a slowly moving sequence on which we can afford to compute full gradients; but this is not the only way to perform such variance reduction). This idea, while very simple, has a lot of implications, both in practice and in theory! The origin of the idea are in the SAG algorithm of <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4633-a-stochastic-gradient-method-with-an-exponential-convergence-_ra" class="liexternal">[Schmidt, Le Roux, Bach, NIPS 2012]</a> and SDCA <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume14/shalev-shwartz13a/shalev-shwartz13a.pdf" class="lipdf">[Shalev-Shwartz and Zhang, JMLR 2013]</a>. A simpler instantiation of the idea, called SVRG appeared shortly after in <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4937-accelerating-stochastic-gradient-descent-using-predictive-variance-reduction.pdf" class="lipdf">[Johnson and Zhang, NIPS 2013]</a> (and also independently at the same NeurIPS, in <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4941-mixed-optimization-for-smooth-functions" class="liinternal">[M. Madhavi, L. Zhang, R. Li, NIPS 2013]</a>).</li>
<li>An intriguing direction that I pursued fervently is the use of convex optimization for problems that have a priori nothing to do with convex optimization. A big inspiration for me was the COLT 2008 paper by Abernethy, Hazan and Rakhlin, who showed how mirror descent naturally solves bandit problems. In this decade, we (this we includes myself and co-authors, but also various other teams) explored how to use mirror descent for other online decision making problems, and made progress on some long-standing problems (k-server and MTS), see for example this set of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAPSKVSdi0obG1b3w4k41JMLFbyBJS5AQ" class="liinternal">video lectures</a> on the “Five miracles of mirror descent”.</li>
<li>Arnak Dalalyan showed how to use ideas inspired from convex optimization to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7392" class="liinternal">analyze the Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm</a>. This was absolutely beautiful work, that led to many many follow-ups.</li>
<li>There has been a lot of rewriting of Nesterov’s acceleration, to try to demystify it. Overall the enterprise is not yet a resounding success in my opinion, but certainly a lot of progress has been made (again I have written a lot about it on this blog already). We now even have optimal acceleration for higher order of smoothness (see this 15 authors <u><font color="#000117"></font><font><a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v99/gasnikov19b/gasnikov19b.pdf" class="lipdf">paper at COLT 2019</a></font></u>), but these techniques are clouded with the same shroud of mystery as was Nesterov’s original method.</li>
<li>Yin Tat Lee and Aaron Sidford obtained an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08033" class="liinternal">efficient construction of a universal barrier</a>.</li>
<li>We now know that certain problems cannot be efficiently represented by SDPs (the so-called “extension complexity), see e.g. this work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6317" class="liinternal">Lee-Raghavendra-Steurer</a>.</li>
<li>We now know how to chase convex bodies, and we can even do so very elegantly with <a href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2019/11/05/convex-body-chasing-steiner-point-sellke-point-and-soda-2020-best-papers/" class="liinternal">the Steiner/Sellke point</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Some other things that captivated me</h2>
<p>The papers above are mostly topics on which I tried to work at some point. Here are some questions that I didn’t work on but followed closely and was fascinated by the progress:</p>
<ol>
<li>The stochastic block model was essentially solved during this decade, see for example <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~eabbe/publications/abbe_FNT_2.pdf" class="lipdf">this survey</a> by Emmanuel Abbe.</li>
<li>The computational/statistical tradeoffs were extensively explored, yet they remain mysterious. A nice impulse to the field was given by this <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1378386239" class="liinternal">COLT 2013 paper</a> by Berthet and Rigollet relating sparse PCA and planted clique. In a similar spirit I also enjoyed the more recent work by Moitra, Jerry Li, and many co-authors on computationally efficient robust estimation (see e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11366" class="liinternal">this recent paper</a>)</li>
<li>Adaptive data analysis strikes me as both very important in practice, and quite deep theoretically, see e.g. <a href="http://nematilab.info/bmijc/assets/091218_paper.pdf" class="lipdf">the reusable holdout by Dwork et al</a>. A related paper that I liked a lot is this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04585" class="liinternal">ICML 2015 paper</a> by Blum and Hardt, which essentially explores the regularization effect of publishing only models that beat the state of the art significantly (more generally this is an extremely interesting question, of why we can keep using the same datasets to evaluate progress in machine learning, see this provokingly titled paper “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10811" class="liinternal">Do ImageNet Classifiers Generalize to ImageNet?</a>“).</li>
<li>A general trend has been in finding very fast (nearly linear time) method for many classical problems. Sometimes these investigations even led to actually practical algorithm, as with this now classical paper by Marco Cuturi at NIPS 2013 titled “<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4927-sinkhorn-distances-lightspeed-computation-of-optimal-transport" class="liexternal">Sinkhorn Distances: Lightspeed Computation of Optimal Transport</a>“.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Oh, one last thing</h2>
<p>I also heard that, surprisingly, gradient descent can work to optimize highly non-convex functions such as training loss for neural networks. Not sure what this is about, it’s a pretty obscure topic, maybe it will catch up in the decade 2020-2029…</p>
<h2>Share some more in the comments!</h2>
<p>The above is only a tiny sample, there were many many more interesting directions being explored (tensor methods for latent variable models <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume15/anandkumar14b/anandkumar14b.pdf" class="lipdf">[Anandkumar, Ge, Hsu, Kakade, Telgarsky, JMLR 14]</a>; phenomenon of “all local minima are good” for various non-convex learning problems, see e.g., <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6048-matrix-completion-has-no-spurious-local-minimum" class="liexternal">[Ge, Lee, Ma, NIPS 2016]</a>; etc etc).

In many combinatorial games, one can prove that the first player wins under best play using a simple but non-constructive argument called strategy-stealing.
This work is about the complexity behind these proofs: how hard is it to actually find a winning move in a game, when you know by strategy-stealing that one exists? 
We prove that this problem is PSPACE-Complete already for Minimum Poset Games and Symmetric Maker-Maker Games, which are simple classes of games that capture two of the main types of strategy-stealing arguments in the current literature.</div>
