<div class="content">
There are various notions of balancing set families that appear in combinatorics and computer science. For example, a family of proper non-empty subsets $S_1,\ldots,S_k \subset [n]$ is balancing if for every subset $X \subset \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ of size $n/2$, there is an $i \in [k]$ so that $|S_i \cap X| = |S_i|/2$. We extend and simplify the framework developed by Hegedüs for proving lower bounds on the size of balancing set families. We prove that if $n=2p$ for a prime $p$, then $k \geq p$. For arbitrary values of $n$, we show that $k \geq n/2 - o(n)$.

We then exploit the connection between balancing families and depth-2 threshold circuits. This connection helps resolve a question raised by Kulikov and Podolskii on the fan-in of depth-2 majority circuits computing the majority function on $n$ bits. We show that any depth-2 threshold circuit that computes the majority on $n$ bits has at least one gate with fan-in at least $n/2 - o(n)$. We also prove a sharp lower bound on the fan-in of depth-2 threshold circuits computing a specific weighted threshold function.</div>

<p>
Jimmy Wales is the co-founder of Wikipedia. Of course this is the wonderful online non-profit encyclopedia we all know and love.</p>
<p>
Today I want to talk about using the web to search for math information. </p>
<p>
I do a huge amount of research on the web. Years ago I would spend hours and hours each week in the library. I looked for books and articles on various math issues. No more. Today it’s all web-based resources. What has happened is that primary sources—research papers—have become as easily browsable as Wikipedia. Many of them, anyway.</p>
<p>
Wikipedia often does not include proofs of mathematical theorems—those are linked to primary papers or authoritative surveys or books. There is a website <a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page">Proof Wiki</a> which tries to bridge the gap without the reader needing to follow links into papers. Right now they are <a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Euclid's_Theorem">featuring</a> Euclid’s Theorem on the infinitude of primes—which we have posted about <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/01/29/primes-and-polynomials/">recently</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/07/11/you-cannot-do-that/">before</a>. They have style guides for how the reasoning is laid out.</p>
<p>
There are also many style guides around the web for writing good mathematics and computer science papers. But the guides seem to stop short of the level of the phrases that irk me. When those phrases show up in the primary sources, there’s no fallback. Let’s take a look.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Phrases </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Here are a few top ones. I omit the well known ones, the ones that are obvious, and some that are in preparation for a future post—just kidding. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>It is well known</i>. Not by me. The reason I am searching for papers on this subject is that I do not know the basics of the area. If you must say this phrase please add a possible reference. That would be extremely helpful.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>Clear from the proof of the theorem</i>. Not by me. This means that the author did not state the proof in the greatest generality possible. We all do this, but it may help if this is avoided.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" title="{\bullet}" /> <i>It is easy to see</i>. Similar to the last item. Ken vividly remembers a seminar in the early 1980s by Peter Neumann at Oxford that showed excerpts from a French mathematician in which the phrase “Il est aisé de voir” appeared often. The French phrase even reads just like the English one. But that mathematician had a reasonable excuse. He was Évariste Galois, and he had a duel early the next morning.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>Proof omitted</i>. Please no.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>Easy calculation</i>. Not by me. The reason it usually is avoided is that it is too difficult a computation. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>This case is the same as the previous case</i>. Not always. This has been the source of errors for me and others over the years. Good place to check the argument. Maybe a suggestion that there should be a Lemma that covers both cases.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>In our paper in preparation</i>. Please no. I cannot read a paper that does not exist yet.</p>
<p>
Finally the worst in my opinion.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>It costs $37.95</i>. Oh no. Many times we find papers that are behind a pay-wall. I always hate this. The authors of course wish to make they work available to all possible. But the reality is that often papers are protected. Thanks to our friends at Wikipedia and Arxiv that this is not the case for lots of stuff. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/02/28/phrases-that-drive-me-crazy/bill-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-15665"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/bill.png?w=600" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15665" /></a></p>
<p>
But I have wondered who ever pays the crazy amount of $37.95? Does anyone ever pay that? Is it equivalent to saying: This paper is not available.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Ken’s Examples </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Ken has one example that has driven him crazy for years and again these past two weeks. Many of you have probably used it often.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" title="{\bullet}" /> <i>This procedure runs in polynomial time.</i> Excuse me, <em>what</em> polynomial time? At least tell us the best exponent you know…</p>
<p>
A related matter is attending to “edge cases” of theorems. Sometimes the edge cases are meant to be excluded. For example, “Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\alpha &gt; 0}" class="latex" title="{\alpha &gt; 0}" />” excludes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\alpha = 0}" class="latex" title="{\alpha = 0}" />; maybe nothing more needs to be said. But in other cases it is not so clear. A theorem may suggest limits and it is nice to say what happens if one tries to take those limits. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What are you favorite phrases that drive you crazy?</p></font></font></div>

It’s about Egyptian fractions – representations of rationals as sums of distinct unit fractions – and is motivated by the conjecture that it’s always possible for all denominators to be semiprime.

Take a moment and imagine a flying pig. Do you see a pig with tiny wings lazily guiding along. But pigs are not particularly slow animals as anyone has seen a <a href="https://youtu.be/-eMV1jxfl40?t=73">pig race</a> at a county fair can attest to that. So why not in the air shouldn't a pig go faster than an unladen African swallow?<br />
<br />
I have a point discussing the fastness of a flying pig. Consider my favorite flying pig, P = NP. I would put more probability on an actual flying pig (thanks CRISPR) than polynomial-time algorithms for traveling salesman.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I get in the following conversation:<br />
<br />
<b>AI person</b>: The P v NP problem is irrelevant as we have machine learning and SAT solvers and we can for all practical purposes solve NP-complete problems.<br />
<b>Me</b>: If P = NP we can solve AI!<br />
<b>AI</b>: If P = NP it's likely to have a very slow poly-time algorithm with high exponents and constants and be for all practical purposes useless.<br />
<br />
Let's break that down. The claim is E(running time of SAT|running time of SAT is poly) = cn<sup>k</sup> for some large c and k. First of all you are conditioning on a probability zero event. Beyond that nearly all the known problems we know that sit in polynomial time have practical efficient solutions. So under the assumption that SAT is one of these problems, why shouldn't the same rule apply. You've already made the assumption we can reduce its running time from exponential to polynomial, so why would it stop at some high polynomial?<br />
<br />
If we are going to talk about the hypothetical flying pig P = NP world, let my algorithms run fast.</div>

<p>The next TCS+ talk will take place this coming Wednesday, March 6th at 1:00 PM Eastern Time (10:00 AM Pacific Time, 19:00 Central European Time, 18:00 UTC). <strong>Shayan Oveis Gharan</strong> from University of Washington will speak about “<em>Strongly log concave polynomials, high dimensional simplicial complexes, and an FPRAS for counting Bases of Matroids</em>” (abstract below).</p>
<p>Please make sure you reserve a spot for your group to join us live by signing up on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/livetalk/live-seat-reservation">the online form</a>. As usual, for more information about the TCS+ online seminar series and the upcoming talks, or to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/suggest">suggest</a> a possible topic or speaker, please see <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/">the website</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Abstract: A matroid is an abstract combinatorial object which generalizes the notions of spanning trees, and linearly independent sets of vectors. I will talk about an efficient algorithm based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique to approximately count the number of bases of any given matroid.</p>
<p>The proof is based on a new connections between high dimensional simplicial complexes, and a new class of multivariate polynomials called completely log-concave polynomials. In particular, we exploit a fundamental fact from our previous work that the bases generating polynomial of any given matroid is a log-concave function over the positive orthant.</p>
<p>Based on joint works with Nima Anari, Kuikui Liu, and Cynthia Vinzant.</p></blockquote>

We investigate the computational power of an arbitrary distinguisher for (not necessarily computable) hitting set generators as well as the set of Kolmogorov-random strings. This work contributes to (at least) two lines of research. One line of research is the study of the limits of black-box reductions to some distributional NP problem. We show that a black-box nonadaptive randomized reduction to any distinguisher for (not only polynomial-time but even) exponential-time computable hitting set generators can be simulated in AM $\cap$ coAM; we also show an upper bound of $\mathrm{S_2^{NP}}$ even if there is no computational bound on a hitting set generator. These results further strengthen the evidence that the recent worst-case to average-case reductions within NP shown by Hirahara (2018, FOCS) are inherently non-black-box. As an application, we show that GapMCSP $\in$ P/poly implies that GapMCSP is low for $\mathrm{S_2^p}$, which is proved by combining our proof techniques with the non-black-box reductions.

Another line of research concerns the computational power of nonadaptive deterministic polynomial-time reductions to the set of Kolmogorov-random strings. It was conjectured by Allender (CiE, 2012) and others that the computational power is exactly characterized by BPP, intuitively because nonadaptive deterministic reductions could only make use of Kolmogorov-random strings as a source of pseudorandomness.

We present strong evidence *against* this conjecture by showing that every language in the exponential-time hierarchy is reducible to the set of Kolmogorov-random strings under PH reductions; in particular, the conjecture is false unless the exponential-time hierarchy collapses to BPEXP. Moreover, our reduction cannot be regarded as a black-box reduction to avoiding hitting set generators (unless the exponential-time hierarchy collapses to the second level), thereby showing that nonadaptive deterministic efficient reductions can exploit the power of Kolmogorov-random strings not just as a distinguisher for hitting set generators.</div>

primitive, and the fastest known algorithm for computing the DFT is the FFT
(Fast Fourier Transform) algorithm. One remarkable feature of FFT is the fact
that its runtime depends only on the size $N$ of the input vector, but not on
the dimensionality of the input domain: FFT runs in time $O(N\log N)$
irrespective of whether the DFT in question is on $\mathbb{Z}_N$ or
$\mathbb{Z}_n^d$ for some $d&gt;1$, where $N=n^d$.
</p>
<p>The state of the art for Sparse FFT, i.e. the problem of computing the DFT of
a signal that has at most $k$ nonzeros in Fourier domain, is very different:
all current techniques for sublinear time computation of Sparse FFT incur an
exponential dependence on the dimension $d$ in the runtime. In this paper we
give the first algorithm that computes the DFT of a $k$-sparse signal in time
$\text{poly}(k, \log N)$ in any dimension $d$, avoiding the curse of
dimensionality inherent in all previously known techniques. Our main tool is a
new class of filters that we refer to as adaptive aliasing filters: these
filters allow isolating frequencies of a $k$-Fourier sparse signal using $O(k)$
samples in time domain and $O(k\log N)$ runtime per frequency, in any dimension
$d$.
</p>
<p>We also investigate natural average case models of the input signal: (1)
worst case support in Fourier domain with randomized coefficients and (2)
random locations in Fourier domain with worst case coefficients. Our techniques
lead to an $\widetilde O(k^2)$ time algorithm for the former and an $\widetilde
O(k)$ time algorithm for the latter.

where an agent sequentially pulls a set of single arms (a.k.a. a super arm) and
tries to find the best super arm. Among a variety of problem settings of the
CPE, we focus on the full-bandit setting, where we cannot observe the reward of
each single arm, but only the sum of the rewards. Although we can regard the
CPE with full-bandit feedback as a special case of pure exploration in linear
bandits, an approach based on linear bandits is not computationally feasible
since the number of super arms may be exponential. In this paper, we first
propose a polynomial-time bandit algorithm for the CPE under general
combinatorial constraints and provide an upper bound of the sample complexity.
Second, we design an approximation algorithm for the 0-1 quadratic maximization
problem, which arises in many bandit algorithms with confidence ellipsoids.
Based on our approximation algorithm, we propose novel bandit algorithms for
the top-k selection problem, and prove that our algorithms run in polynomial
time. Finally, we conduct experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, and
confirm the validity of our theoretical analysis in terms of both the
computation time and the sample complexity.

Moses Jr <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10489">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>We consider cooperation among insects, modeled as cooperation between mobile
robots on a graph. Within this setting, we consider the problem of mobile robot
dispersion on graphs. The study of mobile robots on a graph is an interesting
paradigm with many interesting problems and applications. The problem of
dispersion in this context, introduced by Augustine and Moses Jr., asks that
$n$ robots, initially placed arbitrarily on an $n$ node graph, work together to
quickly reach a configuration with exactly one robot at each node. Previous
work on this problem has looked at the trade-off between the time to achieve
dispersion and the amount of memory required by each robot. However, the
trade-off was analyzed for \textit{deterministic algorithms} and the minimum
memory required to achieve dispersion was found to be $\Omega(\log n)$ bits at
each robot. In this paper, we show that by harnessing the power of
\textit{randomness}, one can achieve dispersion with $O(\log \Delta)$ bits of
memory at each robot, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph.
Furthermore, we show a matching lower bound of $\Omega(\log \Delta)$ bits for
any \textit{randomized algorithm} to solve dispersion.
</p>
<p>We further extend the problem to a general $k$-dispersion problem where $k&gt;
n$ robots need to disperse over $n$ nodes such that at most $\lceil k/n \rceil$
robots are at each node in the final configuration.

function models not only the cost of assigning data points to cluster
representatives, but also a penalty term for disagreement among the
representatives. We motivate this novel problem by applications where we are
interested in clustering data while avoiding selecting representatives that are
too far from each other. For example, we may want to summarize a set of news
sources, but avoid selecting ideologically-extreme articles in order to reduce
polarization.
</p>
<p>To solve the proposed k-median formulation we adopt the local-search
algorithm of Arya et al. We show that the algorithm provides a provable
approximation guarantee, which becomes constant under a mild assumption on the
minimum number of points for each cluster. We experimentally evaluate our
problem formulation and proposed algorithm on datasets inspired by the
motivating applications. In particular, we experiment with data extracted from
Twitter, the US Congress voting records, and popular news sources. The results
show that our objective can lead to choosing less polarized groups of
representatives without significant loss in representation fidelity.

the data stream model. A set of geometric objects is said to be independent if
the objects are pairwise disjoint. We consider geometric objects in one and two
dimensions, i.e., intervals and disks. Let $\alpha$ be the cardinality of the
largest independent set. Our goal is to estimate $\alpha$ in a small amount of
space, given that the input is received as a one-pass turnstile stream. We also
consider a generalization of this problem by assigning weights to each object
and estimating $\beta$, the largest value of a weighted independent set. We
provide the first algorithms for estimating $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in turnstile
streams.

<p>For unit-length intervals, we obtain a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation to
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ in poly$\left(\frac{\log(n)}{\epsilon}\right)$ space. We
also show a matching lower bound. For arbitrary-length intervals, we show any
$c$-approximation to $\alpha$, and thus also $\beta$, requires
$\Omega\left(\frac{n^{1/c}}{2^c}\right)$ space. To this end, we introduce a new
communication problem and lower bound its information complexity. In light of
the lower bound we provide algorithms for estimating $\alpha$ for
arbitrary-length intervals under a bounded intersection assumption. We also
study the parameterized space complexity of estimating $\alpha$ and $\beta$,
where the parameter is the ratio of maximum to minimum interval length. For
unit-radius disks, we obtain a
$\left(\frac{8\sqrt{3}}{\pi}\right)$-approximation to $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in
$\textrm{poly}\left(\frac{\log(n)}{\epsilon}\right)$ space, which is closely
related to the hexagonal circle packing constant.

many applications in theory and practice. For solving a linear program quickly
it is desirable to have a formulation of small size for the given problem. A
useful approach for this is the construction of an extended formulation, which
is a linear program in a higher dimensional space whose projection yields the
original linear program. For many problems it is known that a small extended
formulation cannot exist. However, most of these problems are either
$\mathsf{NP}$-hard (like TSP), or only quite complicated polynomial time
algorithms are known for them (like for the matching problem). In this work we
study the minimum makespan problem on identical machines in which we want to
assign a set of $n$ given jobs to $m$ machines in order to minimize the maximum
load over the machines. We prove that the canonical formulation for this
problem has extension complexity $2^{\Omega(n/\log n)}$, even if each job has
size 1 or 2 and the optimal makespan is 2. This is a case that a trivial greedy
algorithm can solve optimally! For the more powerful configuration integer
program, we even prove a lower bound of $2^{\Omega(n)}$. On the other hand, we
show that there is an abstraction of the configuration integer program
admitting an extended formulation of size $f(\text{opt})\cdot
\text{poly}(n,m)$. In addition, we give an $O(\log n)$-approximate integral
formulation of polynomial size, even for arbitrary processing times and for the
far more general setting of unrelated machines.

m_2, \dots,m_t$ such that the product $A_1^{m_1} A_2^{m_2} \cdots

decidable when $t \leq 2$ for matrices over algebraic numbers but becomes
undecidable for sufficiently large $t$ and $k$ even for integral matrices.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we prove the first decidability results for $t&gt;2$. We show as
one of our central results that for $t=3$ this problem in any dimension is
Turing equivalent to the well-known Skolem problem for linear recurrence
sequences. This implies that it is decidable for $t=3$ and $k \leq 3$ for
matrices over algebraic numbers and for $t=3$ and $k=4$ for matrices over real
algebraic numbers. Another corollary is that the set of triples $(m_1,m_2,m_3)$
for which the equation $A_1^{m_1} A_2^{m_2} A_3^{m_3}$ equals the zero matrix
is equal to a finite union of direct products of semilinear sets.
</p>
<p>For $t=4$ we show that the solution set can be non-semilinear, and thus it
seems unlikely that there is a direct connection to the Skolem problem. However
we prove that the problem is still decidable for upper-triangular $2 \times 2$
rational matrices by employing powerful tools from transcendence theory such as
Baker's theorem and S-unit equations.

standard algorithms that treat the submodular functions in the \emph{value

\emph{precomputational complexity model}, along with a unifying memoization
based framework, which looks at the specific form of the given submodular

\emph{precomputed statistic}, which is maintained in the course of the
algorithms. We show that we can easily integrate this idea into a large class
of submodular optimization problems including constrained and unconstrained
submodular maximization, minimization, difference of submodular optimization,
optimization with submodular constraints and several other related optimization
problems. Moreover, memoization can be integrated in both discrete and
continuous relaxation flavors of algorithms for these problems. We demonstrate
this idea for several commonly occurring submodular functions, and show how the
precomputational model provides significant speedups compared to the value
oracle model. Finally, we empirically demonstrate this for large scale machine
learning problems of data subset selection and summarization.

use information from the current state; thus, they are easy to implement and do
not require substantial computational resources. We propose three local
stochastic policies and prove that they guarantee better performance than any
deterministic local policy in the worst case; experimental results suggest that
they also perform better on average.

submodular function minimization (QDSFM), which allows to model a number of
learning tasks on graphs and hypergraphs. The problem exhibits close ties to
decomposable submodular function minimization (DSFM), yet is much more
challenging to solve. We approach the problem via a new dual strategy and
formulate an objective that can be optimized through a number of double-loop
algorithms. The outer-loop uses either random coordinate descent (RCD) or
alternative projection (AP) methods, for both of which we prove linear
convergence rates. The inner-loop computes projections onto cones generated by
base polytopes of the submodular functions, via the modified min-norm-point or
Frank-Wolfe algorithm. We also describe two new applications of QDSFM:
hypergraph-adapted PageRank and semi-supervised learning. The proposed
hypergraph-based PageRank algorithm can be used for local hypergraph
partitioning, and comes with provable performance guarantees. For
hypergraph-adapted semi-supervised learning, we provide numerical experiments
demonstrating the efficiency of our QDSFM solvers and their significant
improvements on prediction accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art methods.

A major open problem in proof complexity is to prove super-polynomial lower bounds for AC^0[p]-Frege proofs. This system is the analog of AC^0[p], the class of bounded depth circuits with prime modular counting gates. Despite strong lower bounds for this class dating back thirty years (Razborov, '86 and Smolensky, '87), there are no significant lower bounds for AC^0[p]-Frege. Significant and extensive *degree* lower bounds have been obtained for a variety of subsystems of AC^0[p]-Frege, including Nullstellensatz (Beame et. al. '94), Polynomial Calculus (Clegg et. al. '96), and SOS (Griegoriev and Vorobjov, '01). However to date there has been no progress on AC^0[p]-Frege lower bounds.
In this paper we study constant-depth extensions of the Polynomial Calculus introduced by Griegoriev and Hirsch, '03. We show that these extensions are much more powerful than was previously known. Our main result is that small depth Polynomial Calculus (over a sufficiently large field) can polynomially simulate all of the well-studied semialgebraic proof systems: Cutting Planes, Sherali-Adams and Sum-of-Squares, and they can also quasi-polynomially simulate AC^0[p]-Frege as well as TC^0-Frege. Thus, proving strong lower bounds for AC^0[p]-Frege would seem to require proving lower bounds for systems as strong as TC^0-Frege.</div>

<p>If I’m being honest, the most exciting recent development in my life is this: a little over a month ago,<strong> I stopped checking “SneerClub”</strong> (a place I’d previously resolved not even to name here, but I think an exception is warranted now).  Permanently, cold turkey.  I won’t even visit to read their sneers about this post.  I’ve made progress cutting down on other self-destructive social media fixations as well.  Many friends suggested this course to me, and I thank them all, though I ultimately had to follow my own path to the obvious.</p>



<p>Ironically, <em>the SneerClubbers themselves</em> begged me to stop reading them (!), so presumably for once they’ll be okay with something I did (but if not, I don’t care).  If any of them still have something to say to me, they can come to <em>this</em> blog, or email me, or if they pass through Austin, set up a time to hash it out over chips and queso (my treat).  What I’ll no longer do is spend hours every week binge-reading a forum of people who’ve adopted nastiness and bad faith as their explicit principles.  I’ll no longer toss and turn at night wondering how it came about that two thousand Redditors hate Scott Aaronson so much, and what I could say or do (short of total self-abnegation) that would make them hate me less.  I plan to spend the freed-up time <em>being</em> Scott Aaronson.</p>



<p>Resolving to ignore one particular online hate pit—and then <em>sticking</em> to the resolution, as so far I have—has been a pure, unmitigated improvement to my quality of life.  If you don’t believe me, ask my wife and kids.  I recommend this course to anyone.</p>



<p>You could sensibly ask: why did I <em>ever</em> spend time worrying about an anti-nerds-like-me forum that’s so poisonous for its targets and participants alike?  After long introspection, I think the answer is: there’s a part of me, perhaps a gift from the childhood bullies, that’s so obsessed with “society’s hatred of STEM nerds,” that it <em>constantly seeks out evidence to confirm that its fears are justified—</em>evidence that it can then wave in front of the rest of my brain to say “you see??  what did I always tell you?”  And alas, whenever that part of my brain seeks such evidence, the world dutifully supplies mountains of it.  It’s never once disappointed.</p>



<p>Now the SneerClubbers—who are perceptive and talented in their cruelty, if in nothing else—notice this about me, and gleefully ridicule me for it.  But they’re oblivious to the central irony: that unlike the vast majority of humankind, or even the vast majority of social justice activists, they (the SneerClubbers) <em>really do</em> hate everyone like me.  They’re <em>precisely</em> what the paranoid part of my brain wrongly fears that everyone else I meet is secretly like.  They’re like someone who lectures you about your hilariously overblown fear of muggers, <em>while simultaneously mugging you</em>.</p>



<p>But at least they’re not the contented and self-confident bullies of my childhood nightmares, kicking dirt down at nerds from atop their pinnacle of wokeness and social adeptness.  If you spend enough time studying them, they themselves come across as angry, depressed, pathetic.  So for example: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/aexi9v/michael_atiyah_has_passed_away/edtrcc5/">here’s</a> one of my most persistent attackers, popping up on a math thread commemorating Michael Atiyah (one of the great mathematicians of the 20th century), just to insult Atiyah—randomly, gratuitously, and a few days after Atiyah had died.  Almost everything posted all over Reddit by this individual—who uses the accurate tagline “unpleasantly radical”—has the same flavor.  Somehow seeing this made it click for me: wait a second, <em>these</em> are the folks are lecturing <em>me</em> about my self-centeredness and arrogance and terrible social skills?  Like, at least I <em><a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Scott-Aaronson-so-nice">try</a></em> to be nice.</p>


<hr />
<p>Scott Alexander, who writes the <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">world’s best blog</a> and is a more central target of SneerClub than I’ve been, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/22/rip-culture-war-thread/">recently announced</a> that he asked the moderators of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/">r/ssc</a> to close its notorious “Culture War” thread, and they’ve done so—moving the thread to a new home on Reddit called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/">“TheMotte.”</a></p>
<p>For those who don’t know: r/ssc is the place on Reddit to discuss Scott’s SlateStarCodex blog, though Scott himself was never too involved as more than a figurehead.  The Culture War thread was the place within r/ssc to discuss race, gender, immigration, and other hot-button topics.  The thread, which filled up with a bewildering thousands of comments per week (!), attracted the, err … <em>full range</em> of political views, including leftists, libertarians, and moderates but also alt-righters, neoreactionaries, and white nationalists. Predictably, SneerClub treated the thread as a gift from heaven: a constant source of inflammatory material that they could use to smear Scott personally (even if most of the time, Scott hadn’t even <em>seen</em> the offending content, let alone endorsing it).</p>


<p>Four months ago, I was one of the apparently many friends who told Scott that I felt he should dissociate the Culture War thread from his brand.  So I congratulate him on his decision, which (despite his eloquently-expressed misgivings) I feel confident was the right one.  Think about it this way: nobody’s freedom of speech has been curtailed—the thread continues full steam at TheMotte, for anyone who enjoys it—but meanwhile, the sneerers have been deprived of a golden weapon with which to slime Scott.  Meanwhile, while the sneerers themselves might never change their minds about anything, Scott has demonstrated to third parties that he’s open and reasonable and ready to compromise, like the debater who happily switches to his opponent’s terminology.  What’s not to like?</p>


<hr />
<p>A couple weeks ago, while in Albuquerque for the <a href="http://physics.unm.edu/SQuInT/2019/index.php">SQuInT</a> conference, I visited the excellent <a href="https://www.nuclearmuseum.org/">National Museum of Nuclear Science and History</a>.  It was depressing, as it should have been, to tour the detailed exhibits about the murderous events surrounding the birth of the nuclear era: the Holocaust, the Rape of Nanking, the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was depressing in a different way to tour the exhibits about the early Atomic Age, and see the boundless optimism that ‘unleashing the power of the atom’ would finally usher in a near-utopia of space travel and clean energy—and then to compare that vision to where we are now, with climate change ravaging the planet and (in a world-historic irony) the people who care most about the environment having denounced and marginalized the most reliable source of carbon-free energy, the one that probably had the best chance to avert our planet’s terrifying future.</p>


<p>But on the bright side: how wonderful to have born into a time and place when, for the most part, those who hate you have only the power to destroy your life that you yourself grant them.  How wonderful when one can blunt their knives by simply refusing to open a browser tab.</p></div>

<div class="content">
One of the most striking results about fairness in machine learning is the impossibility result that <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/big.2016.0047">Alexandra Chouldechova</a>, and separately<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05807"> Jon Kleinberg, Sendhil Mullainathan, and Manish Raghavan</a> discovered a few years ago. These papers say something very crisp. I'll focus here on the binary classification setting that Alex studies because it is much simpler. There are (at least) three reasonable properties you would want your "fair" classifiers to have. They are:<br /><div><ol><li><b>False Positive Rate Balance</b>: The rate at which your classifier makes errors in the positive direction (i.e. labels negative examples positive) should be the same across groups.</li><li><b>False Negative Rate Balance</b>:  The rate at which your classifier makes errors in the negative direction (i.e. labels positive examples negative) should be the same across groups.</li><li><b>Predictive Parity</b>: The statistical "meaning" of a positive classification should be the same across groups (we'll be more specific about what this means in a moment)</li></ol><div>What Chouldechova and KMR show is that if you want all three, you are out of luck --- unless you are in one of two very unlikely situations: Either you have a <i>perfect</i> classifier that never errs, or the <i>base rate</i> is exactly the same for both populations --- i.e. both populations have exactly the same frequency of positive examples. If you don't find yourself in one of these two unusual situations, then you have to give up on properties 1, 2, or 3. </div></div><div><br /></div><div>This is discouraging, because there are good reasons to want each of properties 1, 2, and 3. And these aren't measures made up in order to formulate an impossibility result --- they have their root in the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">Propublica/COMPASS controversy</a>. Roughly speaking, Propublica discovered that the COMPASS recidivism prediction algorithm violated false positive and negative rate balance, and they took the position that this made the classifier <i>unfair</i>. Northpointe (the creators of the COMPASS algorithm) responded by saying that their algorithm satisfied predictive parity, and took the position that this made the classifier fair. They were seemingly talking past each other by using two different definitions of what "fair" should mean. What the impossibility result says is that there is no way to satisfy both sides of this debate. </div><div><br /></div><div>So why is this result true? The proof in Alex's paper can't be made simpler --- its already a one liner, following from an algebraic identity. But the first time I read it I didn't have a great intuition for <i>why</i> it held. Viewing the statement through the lens of Bayesian inference made the result very intuitive (at least for me). With this viewpoint, all the impossibility result is saying is: "If you have different <i>priors</i> about some event (say that a released inmate will go on to commit a crime) for two different populations, and you receive evidence of the same strength for both populations, then you will have different posteriors as well". This is now bordering on obvious --- because your posterior belief about an event is a combination of your prior belief and the new evidence you have received, weighted by the strength of that evidence.  </div><div><br /></div><div>Lets walk through this. Suppose we have two populations, call them $A$s and $B$s. Individuals $x$ from these populations have some true binary label $\ell(x) \in \{0,1\}$ which we are trying to predict. Individuals from the two populations are drawn from different distributions, which we'll call $D_A$ and $D_B$. We have some classifier that predicts labels $\hat\ell(x)$, and we would like it to satisfy the three fairness criteria defined above. First, lets define some terms:<br /><br />The <i>base rate</i> for a population $i$ is just the frequency of positive labels:<br />$$p_i = \Pr_{x \sim D_i}[\ell(x) = 1].$$<br />The <i>false positive </i>and <i>false negative </i>rates of the classifier are:<br />$$FPR_i = \Pr_{x \sim D_i}[\hat\ell(x) = 1 | \ell(x) = 0] \ \ \ \ FNR_i = \Pr_{x \sim D_i}[\hat\ell(x) = 0 | \ell(x) = 1].$$<br />And the <i>positive predictive value</i> of the classifier is:<br />$$PPV_i = \Pr_{x \sim D_i}[\ell(x) = 1 | \hat\ell(x)=1].$$</div><div>Satisfying all three fairness constraints just means finding a classifier such that $FPR_A = FPR_B$, $FNR_A = FNR_B$, and $PPV_A = PPV_B$.<br /><br />How should we prove that this is impossible? All three of these quantities are conditional probabilities, so we are essentially obligated to apply Bayes Rule:<br />$$PPV_i =  \Pr_{x \sim D_i}[\ell(x) = 1 | \hat\ell(x)=1] = \frac{ \Pr_{x \sim D_i}[\hat\ell(x)=1 | \ell(x) = 1]\cdot \Pr_{x \sim D_i} [\ell(x) = 1]}{ \Pr_{x \sim D_i}[\hat \ell(x) = 1]}$$<br />But now these quantities on the right hand side are things we have names for. Substituting in, we get:<br />$$PPV_i  = \frac{p_i(1-FNR_i)}{p_i(1-FNR_i) + (1-p_i)FPR_i}$$<br /><br />And so now we see the problem. Suppose we have $FNR_A = FNR_B$ and $FPR_A = FPR_B$. Can we have $PPV_A = PPV_B$? There are only two ways. If $p_A = p_B$, then we are done, because the right hand side is the same for either $i \in \{A,B\}$. But if the base rates are different, then the only way to make these two quantities equal is if $FNR_i = FPR_i = 0$ --- i.e. if our classifier is perfect.<br /><br />The piece of intuition here is that the base rate is our prior belief that $\ell(x) = 1$, before we see the output of the classifier. The positive predictive value is our <i>posterior</i> belief that $\ell(x) = 1$, after we see the output of the classifier. And all we need to know about the classifier in order to apply Bayes rule to derive our posterior from our prior is its false positive rate and its false negative rate --- these fully characterize the "strength of the evidence." Hence: "If our prior probabilities differ, and we see evidence of a positive label of the same strength, then our posterior probabilities will differ as well."<br /><br />Once you realize this, then you can generalize the fairness impossibility result to other settings by making equally obvious statements about probability elsewhere. :-)<br /><br />For example, suppose we generalize the labels to be real valued instead of binary --- so when making decisions, we can model individuals using shades of gray. (e.g. in college admissions, we don't have to model individuals as "qualified" or not, but rather can model talent as a real value.) Lets fix a model for concreteness, but the particulars are not important. (The model here is related to my paper with <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~kannan/">Sampath Kannan</a> and<a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~jziani/"> Juba Ziani </a>on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09004">the downstream effects of affirmative action</a>)<br /><br />Suppose that in population $i$, labels are distributed according to a Gaussian distribution with mean $\mu_i$: $\ell(x) \sim N(\mu_i, 1)$. For an individual from group $i$, we have a test that gives an unbiased estimator of their label, with some standard deviation $\sigma_i$: $\hat \ell(x) \sim N(\ell(x), \sigma_i)$.<br /><br />In a model like this, we have analogues of our fairness desiderata in the binary case:<br /><br /><ul><li><b>Analogue of Error Rate Balance</b><i style="font-weight: bold;">: </i>We would like our test to be equally informative about both populations: $\sigma_A = \sigma_B$. </li><li><b>Analogue of Predictive Parity</b>: Any test score $t$ should induce the same posterior expectation on true labels across populations: $$E_{D_A}[\ell(x) | \hat \ell(x) = t] = E_{D_B}[\ell(x) | \hat \ell(x) = t]$$ </li></ul><div>Can we satisfy both of these conditions at the same time? Because the normal distribution is <i>self conjugate</i> (that's why we chose it!) Bayes Rule simplifies to have a nice closed form, and we can compute our posteriors as follows:</div><div>$$E_{D_i}[\ell(x) | \hat \ell(x) = t] = \frac{\sigma_i^2}{\sigma_i^2 + 1}\cdot \mu_i + \frac{1}{\sigma_i^2 + 1}\cdot t$$</div><div>So there are only two ways we can achieve both properties:</div><div><ol><li>We can of course satisfy both conditions if the prior distributions are the same for both groups: $\mu_A = \mu_B$. Then we can set $\sigma_A = \sigma_B$ and observe that the right hand side of the above expression is identical for $i \in \{A, B\}$.</li><li>We can also satisfy both conditions if the prior means are different, but the signal is perfect: i.e. $\sigma_A = \sigma_B = 0$. (Then both posterior means are just $t$, independent of the prior means). </li></ol></div>But we can see from inspection these are the only two cases. If $\sigma_A = \sigma_B$, but the prior means are different, then the posterior means will be different for every $t$. This is really the same impossibility result as in the binary case: all it is saying is that if I have different priors about different groups, but the evidence I receive has the same strength, then my posteriors will also be different.<br /><br />So the mathematical fact is simple --- but its implications remain deep. It means we have to choose between equalizing a decision maker's posterior about the label of an individual, or providing an equally accurate signal about each individual, and that we cannot have both. Unfortunately, living without either one of these conditions can lead to real harm.<br /><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

               Problems with a Point: Exploring Math and Computer Science<br />
               by Gasarch and Kruskal<br />
<br />
(ADDED LATER- the World scientific website has more info than amazon and has a table of contents, so here it is: <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/11261#t=toc">here</a>)<br />
<br />
is now available! The tweet says its $68.00 but that's hardcover- paperback is $38.00 (are covers that expensive) and if you like your books already broken in, there are some used copies for $89.00. Makes sense to me (no it doesn't!). Could be the topic of a blog post (probably already was).<br />
<br />
Okay, so whats in the book?  One of my favorite types of blog posts is when I make a point ABOUT math and then do some math to underscore that point.  I went through all of my blogs (all? No, I doubt I did that) and picked out blogs of that type. With Clyde's help we EXPANDED and POLISHED and GOT THE MATH RIGHT (in some cases I didn't have any math so we had to supply it).<br />
<br />
When I first got a copy (about a month ago) I just couldn't stop reading it. I really like it! This is a non-trivial remark -- often authors get tired of their book, or after a while and wonder things like ``why did I write 300 page on the muffin problem? What was I thinking?'' So the fact that I am very pleased with it is not obvious. Does it mean you will?<br />
<br />
If you ever thought `I wish bill would clean up his posts spelling and grammar AND expand on the math AND make it a more cohesive whole' then buy the book!<br />
<br />
I will in future posts describe more about writing the book, but this is probably my last post where I plug the book.<br />

Probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs) can be verified based only on a constant amount of random queries, such that any correct claim has a proof that is always accepted, and incorrect claims are rejected with high probability (regardless of the given alleged proof). We consider two possible features of PCPs:
- A PCP is *strong* if it rejects an alleged proof of a correct claim with probability proportional to its distance from some correct proof of that claim.
- A PCP is *smooth* if each location in a proof is queried with equal probability.

We prove that all sets in $\mathcal{NP}$ have a smooth and strong PCP of polynomial length that can be verified based on a constant number of queries. We do so by following the proof of the PCP theorem of Arora, Lund, Motwani, Sudan and Szegedy (JACM, 1998), providing a stronger analysis of the Hadamard and Reed--Muller based PCPs and a refined PCP composition theorem. In fact, we show that any set in $\mathcal{NP}$ has a smooth strong *canonical* PCP of Proximity (PCPP), meaning that there is an efficiently computable bijection of $\mathcal{NP}$ witnesses to correct proofs.
	
This improves on the recent result of Dinur, Gur and Goldreich (ITCS, 2019) that constructs strong canonical PCPPs that are inherently non-smooth. Our result implies the hardness of approximating the satisfiability of "stable" 3CNF formulae with bounded variable occurrence, proving a hypothesis used in the work of Friggstad, Khodamoradi and Salavatipour (SODA, 2019). Here *stability* means that the number of clauses violated by an assignment is proportional to its distance from a satisfying assignment (in the relative Hamming metric).</div>

<p><em>The following post was kindly contributed by Karim Adiprasito. (Here is<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10454"> the link to Karim’s paper</a>.) Update: See <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/02/23/karim-adiprasito-the-g-conjecture-for-vertex-decomposible-spheres/#comment-50716">Karim’s comment</a> on the needed ideas for extend the proof to the general case. See also  in the comment section references to papers by <a href="https://www.math.ubc.ca/~karu/papers/simple.pdf">Balin and Fleming</a> and by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7064">Jensen and Yu</a>.</em></p>
<p>So, Gil asked me to say a little bit about my <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/12/25/amazing-karim-adiprasito-proved-the-g-conjecture-for-spheres/">proof of the <em>g</em>-conjecture</a> (and some other conjectures in discrete geometry) on his blog, and since he bought me <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/cubring.png">many</a>  <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/06/20/beyond-the-g-conjecture-algebraic-combinatorics-of-cellular-spaces-i/">coffees </a>to explain it to him (or if he is to be believed, the department paid), I am happy to oblige.</p>
<p>So, I want to explain a special, but critical case to the proof. It contains the some shadow of the core ideas necessary, but needs some more tricks I will remark on afterwards.</p>
<p>Also, I wanted to take this opportunity to mention something marvelous that I learned from <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/leonid-gurvits">Leonid Gurvits</a> recently that increased my own understanding of one of the key tricks used indefinitely. That trick is the following cool lemma.</p>

<p>The <em>g</em>-conjecture (as <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2009/04/02/eran-nevo-the-g-conjecture-i/">described</a> <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2009/04/04/how-the-g-conjecture-came-about/">earlier</a> <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/tag/g-conjecture/"> in Gil’s blog</a>) is implied by the following property:</p>
<p><strong>(HL)</strong> For every sphere <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> of even dimension <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d-1%3D2k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d-1=2k" class="latex" title="d-1=2k" />, there is an Artinian reduction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28S%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A(S)" class="latex" title="A(S)" /> and a degree one element <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\ell" class="latex" title="\ell" /> such that the map</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%5Ek%28S%29+%5C+%5Cxrightarrow%7B%5C+%5Ccdot+%5Cell%5C+%7D%5C+A%5E%7Bk%2B1%7D%28S%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A^k(S) \ \xrightarrow{\ \cdot \ell\ }\ A^{k+1}(S) " class="latex" title="A^k(S) \ \xrightarrow{\ \cdot \ell\ }\ A^{k+1}(S) " /></p>
<p>is an isomorphism.</p>
<p>This is quite a reasonable demand. Indeed, Graebe proved that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%5Ed%28S%29+%5Ccong+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A^d(S) \cong \mathbb{R}" class="latex" title="A^d(S) \cong \mathbb{R}" /> and that the resulting pairing</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%5Ek%28S%29+%5Ctimes+A%5E%7Bk%2B1%7D%28S%29%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A^k(S) \times A^{k+1}(S)\rightarrow \mathbb{R} " class="latex" title="A^k(S) \times A^{k+1}(S)\rightarrow \mathbb{R} " /></p>
<p>is perfect, so <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%5Ek%28S%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A^k(S)" class="latex" title="A^k(S)" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%5E%7Bk%2B1%7D%28S%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A^{k+1}(S)" class="latex" title="A^{k+1}(S)" /> are isomorphic as vector spaces. We shall call this property <strong>(PD)</strong>, because it is a special case of Poincaré pairing.</p>
<p>(HL) is a special case of the Hard Lefschetz Theorem I prove in my paper, and we will prove it for a subset of all triangulated spheres here. Proving it for all spheres implies the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="g" class="latex" title="g" />-conjecture (and other conjectures, such as the Grünbaum conjecture), and proving the hard Lefschetz theorem in full generality is not much harder.</p>

<h2>Vertex-decomposable spheres</h2>
<p>Lets recall a cool notion due to Provan and Billera: A pure simplicial <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d" class="latex" title="d" />-complex is <strong>vertex decomposable</strong> if it is a simplex, or there exists a vertex whose link is vertex decomposable of dimension <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d-1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d-1" class="latex" title="d-1" /> and its deletion is vertex decomposable of dimension <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d" class="latex" title="d" />.</p>
<p>We restrict our attention to vertex decomposable spheres and disks and assume the boundary of the link is vertex decomposable as well in every step.</p>
<p><strong>THEOREM:</strong> Vertex decomposable spheres satisfy (HL).</p>
<p>We prove this theorem by induction on dimension, the base case of zero-dimensional spheres <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28k%3D0%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(k=0)" class="latex" title="(k=0)" /> being clear.</p>
<p>Lets label the vertices of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> in order of their vertex decomposition, from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="1" class="latex" title="1" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" />. Now, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\ell" class="latex" title="\ell" /> will be a linear combination of indeterminates, so lets assume we have constructed an element <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\ell_i" class="latex" title="\ell_i" /> that uses just the first <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" /> of them, and such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\ell_i" class="latex" title="\ell_i" /> itself is as close to a Lefschetz element as possible for its kind, that is, the kernel of</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%5Ek%28S%29+%5C+%5Cxrightarrow%7B%5C+%5Ccdot+%5Cell_i%5C+%7D%5C+A%5E%7Bk%2B1%7D%28S%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A^k(S) \ \xrightarrow{\ \cdot \ell_i\ }\ A^{k+1}(S) " class="latex" title="A^k(S) \ \xrightarrow{\ \cdot \ell_i\ }\ A^{k+1}(S) " /></p>
<p>is the intersection of kernels of the maps</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%5Ek%28S%29+%5C+%5Cxrightarrow%7B%5C+%5Ccdot+x_j%5C+%7D%5C+A%5E%7Bk%2B1%7D%28S%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A^k(S) \ \xrightarrow{\ \cdot x_j\ }\ A^{k+1}(S) " class="latex" title="A^k(S) \ \xrightarrow{\ \cdot x_j\ }\ A^{k+1}(S) " /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="j" class="latex" title="j" /> ranges from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="1" class="latex" title="1" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" />.</p>
<p>We want to construct a map <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell_%7Bi%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\ell_{i+1}" class="latex" title="\ell_{i+1}" /> with this property (which I call the <strong>transversal prime property</strong>}. To this effect, we want to apply the perturbation lemma to the maps <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+x_%7Bi%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\beta x_{i+1}" class="latex" title="\beta x_{i+1}" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%3D%5Cell_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\alpha=\ell_i" class="latex" title="\alpha=\ell_i" />, and with respect to the spaces <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%3DA%5Ek%28S%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="X=A^k(S)" class="latex" title="X=A^k(S)" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y%3DA%5E%7Bk%2B1%7D%28S%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="Y=A^{k+1}(S)" class="latex" title="Y=A^{k+1}(S)" />. Let us denote by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D" class="latex" title="D" /> the ball given as the union of neighborhoods of the first <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" /> vertices.</p>
<p>For this, we have to find out the kernel of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\ell_i" class="latex" title="\ell_i" />. But this is the the ideal in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28S%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A(S)" class="latex" title="A(S)" /> generated by the monomials of faces which are not in the neighborhood of any of the first <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" /> vertices. Lets call it <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="K" class="latex" title="K" />. Lets also look at the image <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="I" class="latex" title="I" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\ell_i" class="latex" title="\ell_i" />, which by Graebe’s theorem is exactly the span of the images of the maps the maps</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%5Ek%28S%29+%5C+%5Cxrightarrow%7B%5C+%5Ccdot+x_j%5C+%7D%5C+A%5E%7Bk%2B1%7D%28S%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A^k(S) \ \xrightarrow{\ \cdot x_j\ }\ A^{k+1}(S) " class="latex" title="A^k(S) \ \xrightarrow{\ \cdot x_j\ }\ A^{k+1}(S) " /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="j" class="latex" title="j" /> ranges from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="1" class="latex" title="1" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" />.</p>
<p>But then, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bi%2B1%7DK+%5Ccap+I&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x_{i+1}K \cap I" class="latex" title="x_{i+1}K \cap I" /> is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="0" class="latex" title="0" /> in degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="k+1" class="latex" title="k+1" /> if and only if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28st_%7Bi%2B1%7D+%5Cpartial+D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A(st_{i+1} \partial D)" class="latex" title="A(st_{i+1} \partial D)" /> is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="0" class="latex" title="0" /> in degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" />. Why is that? Because with respect to the Poincaré pairing, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bi%2B1%7DK+%5Ccap+I&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x_{i+1}K \cap I" class="latex" title="x_{i+1}K \cap I" /> (in degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="k+1" class="latex" title="k+1" />) and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28st_%7Bi%2B1%7D+%5Cpartial+D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A(st_{i+1} \partial D)" class="latex" title="A(st_{i+1} \partial D)" /> (in degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" />) are dual.<br />
The ring <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28st_%7Bi%2B1%7D+%5Cpartial+D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A(st_{i+1} \partial D)" class="latex" title="A(st_{i+1} \partial D)" /> is obtained by taking <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Bst_%7Bi%2B1%7D+%5Cpartial+D%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb{R}[st_{i+1} \partial D]" class="latex" title="\mathbb{R}[st_{i+1} \partial D]" />, seen as a quotient of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5BS%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb{R}[S]" class="latex" title="\mathbb{R}[S]" /> and modding out by the ideal generated by the linear system <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CTheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\Theta" class="latex" title="\Theta" />. But that is of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d" class="latex" title="d" />, even though <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=st_%7Bi%2B1%7D+%5Cpartial+D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="st_{i+1} \partial D" class="latex" title="st_{i+1} \partial D" /> is only of dimension <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d-2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d-2" class="latex" title="d-2" />. We can remove the vertex <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="i+1" class="latex" title="i+1" /> for the price of removing one of the linear forms, but then we have the same issue, having a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28d-3%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(d-3)" class="latex" title="(d-3)" />-sphere <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=st_%7Bi%2B1%7D+%5Cpartial+D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="st_{i+1} \partial D" class="latex" title="st_{i+1} \partial D" /> and a system <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CTheta%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\Theta'" class="latex" title="\Theta'" /> of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d-1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d-1" class="latex" title="d-1" />. Still, one too many! Taking a subsystem of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d-2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d-2" class="latex" title="d-2" />, we obtain an Artinian reduction for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Blk_%7Bi%2B1%7D+%5Cpartial+D%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb{R}[lk_{i+1} \partial D]" class="latex" title="\mathbb{R}[lk_{i+1} \partial D]" /> via a linear system <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CTheta%27%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\Theta''" class="latex" title="\Theta''" />, but what happens to the additional linear form of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CTheta%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\Theta'" class="latex" title="\Theta'" /> not in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CTheta%27%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\Theta''" class="latex" title="\Theta''" />? It has to act as a Lefschetz element on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Blk_%7Bi%2B1%7D+%5Cpartial+D%5D%2F%5CTheta%27%27%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Blk_%7Bi%2B1%7D+%5Cpartial+D%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb{R}[lk_{i+1} \partial D]/\Theta''\mathbb{R}[lk_{i+1} \partial D]" class="latex" title="\mathbb{R}[lk_{i+1} \partial D]/\Theta''\mathbb{R}[lk_{i+1} \partial D]" /> if we want</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28st_%7Bi%2B1%7D+%5Cpartial+D%29%5C+%5Ccong%5C+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Blk_%7Bi%2B1%7D+%5Cpartial+D%5D%2F%5CTheta%27%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Blk_%7Bi%2B1%7D+%5Cpartial+D%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A(st_{i+1} \partial D)\ \cong\ \mathbb{R}[lk_{i+1} \partial D]/\Theta'\mathbb{R}[lk_{i+1} \partial D]" class="latex" title="A(st_{i+1} \partial D)\ \cong\ \mathbb{R}[lk_{i+1} \partial D]/\Theta'\mathbb{R}[lk_{i+1} \partial D]" /></p>
<p>to be trivial in degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" />. But we may assume so by induction! Hence, we can choose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell_%7Bi%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\ell_{i+1}" class="latex" title="\ell_{i+1}" /> as the generic sum of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\ell_i" class="latex" title="\ell_i" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bi%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x_{i+1}" class="latex" title="x_{i+1}" /> by the perturbation lemma.</p>
<p>So, ultimately, we can construct a map <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\ell_n" class="latex" title="\ell_n" /> with the transversal prime property. But then its kernel is the intersection of the kernels of</p>

<h2>And beyond?</h2>
<p>Now, we have the Lefschetz theorem for a special class, but that is less than what we want in the end, since vertex decomposable spheres are few and in between (do you see a reason why? there are many). So, what do we do? For a long time, I tried to extend the perturbation lemma to combine more than two maps.<br />
Recently (depending on when Gil puts this post on the blog), I met Leonid Gurvits for the first time on a marvelous little conference at the Simons Institute. I knew that the problem is related to Hall’s Marriage Theorem for operators (I explain this connection a bit further in my paper), but Leonid enlightened this further by pointing me towards several nice papers, starting with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0201022">his work on Quantum Matching Theory</a>. Indeed, finding a good extension to three and more maps would essentially mean that we could also find Hall Marriage Type Theorems for 3-regular hypergraphs, which we know for complexity reasons to be unlikely.</p>
<p>So what can we do instead? Well, it turns out that I only really needed to look at the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" />-skeleton of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> above, and there is no need to be vertex decomposable. It is enough to find another nicely decomposable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d-1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d-1" class="latex" title="d-1" />-manifold that contains it the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" />-skeleton of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" />, and then use some technical topological tricks to connect the local picture to global homological properties.</p>

Giuseppe Vitali was the mathematician who famously used the Axiom of Choice, in 1905, to give the first example of a non-measurable subset of the real numbers.</p>
<p>
Today I want to discuss another of his results that is a powerful tool.<span id="more-15657"></span></p>
<p>
The existence of a set that cannot properly be assigned a measure was a surprise at the time, and still is a surprise. It is a wonderful example of the power of the Axiom of Choice. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitali_set">this</a> for details. </p>
<p>
We are interested in another of his results that is more a theorem about coverings. It is the Vitali covering theorem–see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitali_covering_lemma">this</a>. The theorem shows that a certain type of covering—ah, we will explain the theorem in a moment.</p>
<p>
The power of this theorem is that it can be used to construct various objects in analysis. There are now many applications of this theorem. It is a powerful tool that can be used to prove many nice results. I do not know of any—many?—applications of the existence of a non-measurable set. Do you know any?</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Making A Mapping Injective </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Let’s look at an application of the Vitali theorem that may be new. But in any case it may help explain what the Vitali theorem is all about.</p>
<p>
Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%3AX+%5Crightarrow+Y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F:X \rightarrow Y}" class="latex" title="{F:X \rightarrow Y}" />. We can make the map surjective if we restrict <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> to be equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28X%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F(X)}" class="latex" title="{F(X)}" />. It is not so simple to make the map injective, but we can in general do that also. </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em><a name="choice"></a> Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> be a surjective function from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" />. Then there is a subset <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> so that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> is injective from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" />. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
<em>Proof:</em>  For each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> select one <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> from the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%5E%7B-1%7D%28y%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F^{-1}(y)}" class="latex" title="{F^{-1}(y)}" /> and place it into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" />. Recall <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%5E%7B-1%7D%28y%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F^{-1}(y)}" class="latex" title="{F^{-1}(y)}" /> is the set of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{z}" class="latex" title="{z}" /> so that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28z%29%3Dy%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F(z)=y}" class="latex" title="{F(z)=y}" />.This of course uses the Axiom of Choice to make the choices of which <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> to choose. Then clearly <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" /> is the required set. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CBox&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\Box" class="latex" title="\Box" /></p>
<p>
The difficulty with this trivial theorem is that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" /> cannot be controlled easily if it is constructed via the Axiom of Choice. It could be a very complicated set. Our goal is to see how well we can control <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" /> if we assume that the mapping <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> is smooth. </p>
<p>
How can we do better? The answer is quite a bit better if we assume that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> is a “nice” function. We give up surjectivity onto <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> but only by a null set.</p>

<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Set Coverings </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
How can we prove this theorem? An obvious idea is to do the following. Pick an open interval <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU%3D%5Ba%2Cb%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{U=[a,b]}" class="latex" title="{U=[a,b]}" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> so that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28U%29+%3D+V%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F(U) = V}" class="latex" title="{F(U) = V}" /> for an open set in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{V}" class="latex" title="{V}" /> and so that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> is injective from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{U}" class="latex" title="{U}" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{V}" class="latex" title="{V}" />. Setting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{U}" class="latex" title="{U}" /> clearly works: the map <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> is injective on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" />. This is far from the large set that we wish to have, but it is a start. The intuition is to select another open interval <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{U'}" class="latex" title="{U'}" /> that is disjoint from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{U}" class="latex" title="{U}" /> so that again <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> is injective from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{U'}" class="latex" title="{U'}" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{V'}" class="latex" title="{V'}" />. We can then add <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{U'}" class="latex" title="{U'}" /> to our <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" />. </p>
<p>
We can continue in this way and collect many open sets that we add to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" />. Can we arrange that the union of these sets yield a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" /> so that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28S%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F(S)}" class="latex" title="{F(S)}" /> is most of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" />? In general the answer is no. Suppose that the intervals are the following: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Bk%2Ck%2B1.1%5D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  [k,k+1.1] " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  [k,k+1.1] " /></p>
<p>for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%3D0%2C1%2C2%2C%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k=0,1,2,\dots}" class="latex" title="{k=0,1,2,\dots}" /> Roughly we can only get about half of the space that the intervals cover and keep the chosen intervals disjoint. If we select <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B+%5Bk%2Ck%2B1.1%5D+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{ [k,k+1.1] }" class="latex" title="{ [k,k+1.1] }" /> then we cannot select <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Bk%2B1%2Ck%2B1%2B1.1%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{[k+1,k+1+1.1]}" class="latex" title="{[k+1,k+1+1.1]}" /> since 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Bk%2Ck%2B1.1%5D+%5Ccap+%5Bk%2B1%2Ck%2B1%2B1.1%5D+%5Cneq+%5Cemptyset.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  [k,k+1.1] \cap [k+1,k+1+1.1] \neq \emptyset. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  [k,k+1.1] \cap [k+1,k+1+1.1] \neq \emptyset. " /></p>
<p>Vitali’s theorem comes to the rescue. It allows us to avoid his problem, by insisting that intervals have an additional property.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Vitali Covering Theorem </h2><p></p>

The trick is to use a refinement of a set cover that allows a disjoint cover to exist for almost all of the target set. The next definition is critical to the Vitali covering theorem. </p>

The Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) asks if a given truth table of a Boolean function $f$ can be computed by a Boolean circuit of size at most $\theta$, for a given parameter $\theta$. We improve several circuit lower bounds for MCSP, using pseudorandom generators (PRGs) that are local; a PRG is called local if its output bit strings, when viewed as the truth table of a Boolean function, can be computed by a Boolean circuit of small size. We get new and improved lower bounds for MCSP that almost match the best-known lower bounds against several circuit models. 

Specifically, we show that computing MCSP, on functions with a truth table of length $N$, requires

   $N^{3-o(1)}$-size de Morgan formulas, improving the recent $N^{2-o(1)}$ lower bound by Hirahara and Santhanam (CCC, 2017),
 $N^{2-o(1)}$-size formulas over an arbitrary basis or general branching programs (no non-trivial lower bound was known for MCSP against these models), and 
    $2^{\Omega\left(N^{1/(d+2.01)}\right)}$-size depth-$d$ $AC^0$ circuits, improving the superpolynomial lower bound by Allender et al. (SICOMP, 2006).

 
    	The $AC^0$ lower bound stated above matches the best-known $AC^0$ lower bound (for PARITY) up to a small additive constant in the depth. Also, for the special case of depth-$2$ circuits (i.e., CNFs or DNFs), we get an almost optimal lower bound of \(2^{N^{1-o(1)}}\) for MCSP.</div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>In the 1990s I published a series of papers on data structures for closest pairs. As long as you already know how to maintain dynamic sets of objects of some type, and answer nearest-neighbor queries among them, you can also keep track of the closest pair, and this can be used as a subroutine in many other
computational geometry algorithms. But it turns out that many of those algorithms can now be simplified and sped up by using mutual nearest neighbors (pairs of objects that are each other’s nearest neighbors) instead of closest pairs.</p>

<p>My original motivation for studying these types of problems was to maintain minimum spanning trees of dynamic point sets, using closest red-blue pairs of Euclidean points,<sup id="fnref:aem"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/02/21/mutual-nearest-neighbors.html#fn:aem" class="footnote">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:ebf"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/02/21/mutual-nearest-neighbors.html#fn:ebf" class="footnote">2</a></sup> and I later found more applications in hierarchical clustering, greedy matching, traveling salesperson heuristics,<sup id="fnref:fhc"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/02/21/mutual-nearest-neighbors.html#fn:fhc" class="footnote">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:lazy"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/02/21/mutual-nearest-neighbors.html#fn:lazy" class="footnote">4</a></sup> and (with Jeff Erickson) motorcycle graphs and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_skeleton">straight skeletons</a>.<sup id="fnref:ee"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/02/21/mutual-nearest-neighbors.html#fn:ee" class="footnote">5</a></sup> But to use these closest pair data structures, you have to pay two logarithmic factors in time complexity over the time for the underlying nearest-neighbor data structure. So they’re not competitive with (uncolored) Euclidean closest pair data structures, which take only logarithmic time in any fixed dimension. Instead they make more sense to use with other distances than Euclidean, with objects more complicated than single points, or with variations like the red-blue closest pair for which the logarithmic-time solution doesn’t work.</p>

<p>For several variations of hierarchical clustering, an alternative and simpler technique has been known for quite a bit longer, based on finding mutual nearest neighbors (pairs of objects that are nearer to each other than to anything else) rather than closest pairs.<sup id="fnref:ben"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/02/21/mutual-nearest-neighbors.html#fn:ben" class="footnote">6</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:juan"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/02/21/mutual-nearest-neighbors.html#fn:juan" class="footnote">7</a></sup> It’s called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest-neighbor_chain_algorithm">nearest neighbor chain algorithm</a>, but really it’s a data structure rather than an algorithm, one that allows you to maintain a dynamic point set and find pairs of mutual nearest neighbors, again based on calls to an underlying nearest neighbor data structure. The idea is to maintain a stack of shorter and shorter pairs of nearest neighbors, until the two objects whose distance is on the top of the stack have nothing nearer – they are mutual nearest neighbors. Whenever you want a pair of neighbors, you look at the top pair, an object  and its nearest neighbor , and ask whether ’s nearest neighbor is . If so, you have found a mutual nearest neighbor pair, and if not you have a new shorter distance to push onto the stack.</p>

<p>One can this in a hierarchical clustering algorithm that repeatedly finds and merges the nearest two clusters, whenever the distance between clusters has a special property: a merged cluster is never closer to other clusters than the closer of the two clusters that was merged. This property implies both that the stack of distances remains valid after the merge, and that mutual nearest neighbors are always safe to merge. If two clusters are mutual nearest neighbors, then the closest-pair clustering algorithm will eventually merge them, because none of its actions can cause them to stop being mutual nearest neighbors. So we might as well merge them immediately once we discover them to be mutual nearest neighbors. (One way to formulate this mathematically is that the set of mutual nearest neighbor pairs merged by the clustering algorithm forms an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatroid">antimatroid</a>). When this works, you get a clustering algorithm that uses a linear number of nearest neighbor queries, instead of the  queries that you would get using my closest-pair data structures.</p>

<p>In more recent research with UCI student Nil Mamano (finishing his doctorate this year; hire him for a postdoc, he’s good!) we noticed that the nearest neighbor chain algorithm can also be applied to certain <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2017/04/11/stable-grid-matching.html">stable marriage problems with preferences coming from geometric distances</a>.<sup id="fnref:egm"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/02/21/mutual-nearest-neighbors.html#fn:egm" class="footnote">8</a></sup> Our latest preprint, “Euclidean TSP, Motorcycle Graphs, and Other New Applications of Nearest-Neighbor Chains” (with Efrat, Frishberg, Goodrich, Kobourov, Mamano, Matias, and Polishchuk, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06875">arXiv:1902.06875</a>) extends this to a much broader set of applications. As well as simplifying and speeding up my previous work on motorcycle graphs and TSP heuristics, we also use nearest neighbor chains in a bigger class of stable matching problems and in an approximate geometric set cover problem. In each case, we need to show either that the problem has an antimatroid-like property (so using mutual nearest neighbors produces the same solution as closest pairs) or that, even when varying from the same solution, it achieves the same quality. It’s not quite true that anything closest pairs can do, mutual nearest neighbors can do better, but it’s close.</p>

<p>Another idea in the paper is that to find (exact!) mutual nearest neighbor pairs one can sometimes get away with using approximate near neighbor structures. This is important if you’re using Euclidean distance, because the time bounds for exact nearest neighbors have the form  for constants  that get very small as  gets large, while approximate nearest neighbors are logarithmic in all dimensions. The idea is to build the stack of shorter distances by asking for a constant number of approximate near neighbors, the th of which is within a constant factor of the distance to the actual th nearest neighbor. By a packing argument for points in Euclidean space, either some two of these points are closer to each other than the distance on the current stack top (in which case you can build the stack one more level) or these approximate neighbors are guaranteed to contain the actual nearest neighbor (in which case you can either detect a mutual nearest neighbor pair or again build the stack).
This idea leads, for instance, to an algorithm for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-fragment_algorithm">multi-fragment TSP heuristic</a> that takes time  in Euclidean spaces of any bounded dimension; the best previous time appears to be an -time algorithm (valid in any metric space) from one of my previous papers.<sup id="fnref:fhc:1"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/02/21/mutual-nearest-neighbors.html#fn:fhc" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

Last weekend I saw the documentary <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7428030/">Joseph Pulitzer: Voice of the People</a>. Pulitzer, as you probably know from the prize named after him, was a major newspaper publisher in the late 19th and early 20th century. He ran two papers, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and The New York World. The World at one point took on massive proportions, including sheet music of the latest tunes and dress patterns of new fashion that one could make at home. The World was the Internet of the turn of the 20th century.<br />
<br />
The movie mentioned the many editions of the paper during the day, including the extra edition. An extra edition came out because of some major breaking news story. Back then newspapers would drum up minor stories to sell extra editions but they tended to disappear over time.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to Monday, August 19, 1991. Hard-line members of the communist party of the USSR <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Soviet_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt">attempted a coup</a> to take over the government from Mikhail Gorbachev. To us in the US, this seemed like the cold war which appeared to be coming to an end might rekindle. At the time I lived in Chicago and on that Monday the Chicago Tribune ran an extra afternoon edition talking about the coup. The return to the cold war didn't happen. Within a couple of days the coup failed and if anything hastened the dissolution of the Soviet Republic.<br />
<br />
That was probably the last of the extra editions. By the time of the next major historical event, ten years and twenty-three days later, we had the Internet and cell phones and one no longer needed a newspaper to tell you the world has changed.</div>

The Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) asks whether a (given) Boolean function has a circuit of at most a (given) size. Despite over a half-century of study, we know relatively little about the computational complexity of MCSP. We do know that questions about the complexity of MCSP have significant ramifications on longstanding open problems. In a recent development, Golovnev et al. [11] improves the status of unconditional lower bounds for MCSP, showing that MCSP is not in $AC^0[p]$ for any prime $p$. While their results generalize to most "typical" circuit classes, it fails to generalize to the circuit minimization problem for depth-d formulas, denoted ($AC^0_d$)-MCSP. In particular, their result relies on a Lipchitz hypothesis that is unknown (and possibly false) in the case of ($AC^0_d$)-MCSP. Despite this, we show that ($AC^0_d$)-MCSP is not in $AC^0[p]$ by proving even the failure of the Lipchitzness for $AC^0_d$ formulas implies that MAJORITY reduces to ($AC^0_d$)-MCSP under $AC^0$ truth table reductions. Somewhat remarkably, our proof (in the case of non-Lipchitzness) uses completely different techniques than [11]. To our knowledge, this is the first MCSP reduction that uses modular properties of a function's circuit complexity.

We also define MOCSP, an oracle version of MCSP that takes as input a Boolean function $f$, a size threshold $s$, and oracle Boolean functions $f_1, ..., f_t$, and determines whether there is an oracle circuit of size at most $s$ that computes $f$ when given access to $f_1, ... , f_t$. We prove that MOCSP is $NP$-complete under non-uniform $AC^0$ many-one reductions as well as (uniform) $ZPP$ truth table reductions. We also observe that improving this $ZPP$ reduction to a deterministic polynomial-time reduction requires showing $EXP \neq ZPP$ (using theorems of Hitchcock and Pavan [17] and Murray and Williams [22]). Optimistically, these MOCSP results could be a first step towards $NP$-hardness results for MCSP. At the very least, we believe MOCSP clarifies the barriers towards proving hardness for MCSP and provides a useful "testing ground" for questions about MCSP.</div>

We show that any nondeterministic read-once branching program that computes a satisfiable Tseitin formula based on an $n\times n$ grid graph has size at least $2^{\Omega(n)}$. Then using the Excluded Grid Theorem by Robertson and Seymour we show that for arbitrary graph $G(V,E)$ any nondeterministic read-once branching program that computes a satisfiable Tseitin formula based on $G$ has size at least $2^{\Omega(tw(G)^\delta)}$ for all $\delta &lt;1/36$, where $tw(G)$ is the treewidth of $G$ (for planar graphs and some other classes of graphs the statement holds for $\delta=1$). We also show an upper bound $O(|E| 2^{pw(G)})$, where $pw(G)$ is the pathwidth of $G$.

We apply the mentioned results in the analysis of the complexity of derivation in the proof system $OBDD(\land, reordering)$ and show that any $OBDD(\land, reordering)$-refutation of an unsatisfiable Tseitin formula based on a graph $G$ has size at least $2^{\Omega(tw(G)^\delta)}$.</div>

All of twitter is .... atwitter?... over the <a href="https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/">OpenAI announcement</a> and partial non-release of code/documentation for a language model that purports to generate realistic-sounding text from simple prompts. The system actually addresses many NLP tasks, but the one that's drawing the most attention is the deepfakes-like generation of plausible news copy (<a href="https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/#sample3">here's one sample</a>).<br /><br />Most consternation is over the rapid PR buzz around the announcement, including somewhat breathless headlines (that OpenAI is not responsible for) like<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/17/openai-text-generator-dangerous/">OpenAI built a text generator so good, it’s considered too dangerous to release</a></blockquote>or<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/02/researchers-scared-by-their-own-work-hold-back-deepfakes-for-text-ai/">Researchers, scared by their own work, hold back “deepfakes for text” AI</a></blockquote>There are concerns that OpenAI is overhyping solid but incremental work, that they're disingenuously allowing for overhyped coverage in the way they released the information, or worse that they're deliberately controlling hype as a publicity stunt.<br /><br />I have nothing useful to add to the discussion above: indeed, see posts by <a href="https://anima-ai.org/2019/02/18/an-open-and-shut-case-on-openai/">Anima Anandkumar,</a> <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/should-i-open-source-my-model-1c109188b164">Rob Munro</a>, <a href="http://approximatelycorrect.com/2019/02/17/openai-trains-language-model-mass-hysteria-ensues/">Zachary Lipton</a>  and <a href="https://medium.com/@lowe.ryan.t/openais-gpt-2-the-model-the-hype-and-the-controversy-1109f4bfd5e8?sk=bc319cebc22fe0459574544828c84c6d">Ryan Lowe</a> for a comprehensive discussion of the issues relating to OpenAI.  Jack Clark from OpenAI has been engaging in a lot of twitter discussion on this as well.<br /><br />But what I do want to talk about is the larger issues around responsible science that this kerfuffle brings up. Caveat, as Margaret Mitchell puts it in this searing thread.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><div lang="en" dir="ltr">It's really hard to watch the GPT-2 conversations unfold like so much else in tech. 1/</div>— MMitchell (@mmitchell_ai) <a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1097626427048964098?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2019</a></blockquote><br />To understand the kind of "norm-building" that needs to happen here, let's look at two related domains.<br /><br />In computer security, there's a fairly well-established model for finding weaknesses in systems. An exploit is discovered, the vulnerable entity is given a chance to fix it, and then the exploit is revealed , often simultaneously with patches that rectify it. Sometimes the vulnerability isn't easily fixed (see <a href="https://meltdownattack.com/">Meltdown and Spectre</a>). But it's still announced.<br /><br />A defining characteristic of security exploits is that they are targeted, specific and usually suggest a direct patch. The harms might be theoretical, but are still considered with as much seriousness as the exploit warrants.<br /><br />Let's switch to a different domain: biology. Starting from the sequencing of the human genome through the <a href="https://allofus.nih.gov/">million-person precision medicine project </a>to CRISPR and cloning babies, genetic manipulation has provided both invaluable technology for curing disease as well as grave ethical concerns about misuse of the technology. And professional organizations as well as the NIH have (sometimes slowly) risen to the challenge of articulating norms around the use and misuse of such technology.<br /><br />Here, the harms are often more diffuse, and the harms are harder to separate from the benefits. But the harm articulation is often focused on the individual patient, especially given the shadow of abuse that darkens the history of medicine.<br /><br />The harms with various forms of AI/ML technology are myriad and diffuse. They can cause structural damage to society - in the concerns over bias, the ways in which automation affects labor, the way in which fake news can erode trust and a common frame of truth, and so many others - and they can cause direct harm to individuals. And the scale at which these harms can happen is immense.<br /><br />So where are the professional groups, the experts in thinking about the risks of democratization of ML, and all the folks concerned about the harms associated with AI tech? Why don't we have the equivalent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asilomar_Conference_on_Recombinant_DNA">Asilomar conference on recombinant DNA</a>?<br /><br />I appreciate that OpenAI has at least raised the issue of thinking through the ethical ramifications of releasing technology. But as the furore over their decision has shown, no single imperfect actor can really claim to be setting the guidelines for ethical technology release, and "starting the conversation" doesn't count when (again as Margaret Mitchell points out) these kinds of discussions have been going on in different settings for many years already.<br /><br />Ryan Lowe suggests workshops at major machine learning conferences. That's not a bad idea. But it will attract the people who go to machine learning conferences. It won't bring in the journalists, the people getting SWAT'd (and one case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Wichita_swatting">killed</a>) by fake news, the women being harassed by trolls online with deep-fake porn images. <br /><br />News is driven by news cycles. Maybe OpenAI's announcement will lead to us thinking more about issues of responsible data science. But let's not pretend these are new, or haven't been studied for a long time, or need to have a discussion "started".<br /><br /><br /><div class="feedflare">

We show that any $n$-variate polynomial computable by a syntactically multilinear circuit of size $\mathop{poly}(n)$ can be computed by a depth-$4$ syntactically multilinear ($\Sigma\Pi\Sigma\Pi$) circuit of size at most $\exp\left({O\left(\sqrt{n\log n}\right)}\right)$. For degree $d = \omega(n/\log n)$, this improves upon the upper bound of $\exp\left({O(\sqrt{d}\log n)}\right)$ obtained by Tavenas (MFCS 2015) for general circuits, and is known to be asymptotically optimal in the exponent when $d &lt; n^{\epsilon}$ for a small enough constant $\epsilon$. Our upper bound matches the lower bound of $\exp\left({\Omega\left(\sqrt{n\log n}\right)}\right)$ proved by Raz and Yehudayoff (CC 2009), and thus cannot be improved further in the exponent. Our results hold over all fields and also generalize to circuits of small individual degree.  

More generally, we show that an $n$-variate polynomial computable by a syntactically multilinear circuit of size $\mathop{poly}(n)$ can be computed by a syntactically multilinear circuit of product-depth $\Delta$ of size at most $\exp\left(O\left(\Delta \cdot (n/\log n)^{1/\Delta} \cdot \log n\right)\right)$. It follows from the lower bounds of Raz and Yehudayoff (CC 2009) that in general, for constant $\Delta$, the exponent in this upper bound is tight and cannot be improved to $o\left(\left(n/\log n\right)^{1/\Delta}\cdot \log n\right)$.</div>

I recently read an absurd article that speculated on who the Democratic VICE prez nominees will be. Yes, you read that right, VICE Prez. Gee, wouldn't knowing who the Prez nominees was first help. But leave it to Nate Silver and company to have a fascinating yet... premature article on this. Here is the link: <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-very-first-2020-vice-presidential-draft/">article on who will be Dem VP nominee</a>.  Its hard enough to pick the VP when the Prez is known! I did a blog on how badly intrade would do on predicting VP, <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2008/09/i-would-be-on-intrade-that-intrade-will.html">here</a>. I didn't predict that intrade would go out of business (`intrade' was short hand for `betting markets' just like `Uber' is shorthand for `hailing a car with your phone'- I wonder if the term `Uber' will still be used if they go out of business?)<br />
<br />
After reading I thought<br />
<br />
<i>Wow- there are so many If-Then clauses in this that I could make half a lecture about it for my Discrete Math class where we are talking about Prop. Logic.</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
I emailed the students to read it, and we had a lively discussion. I made sure it was a non-partisan discussion. Realize that a statement like:<br />
<br />
<i>If the Prez is a female then the VP will likely be a male because it is thought, righly or wrongly, that all-female ticket can't win</i><br />
<br />
is not partisan or sexist, it is stating an opinion about how voters would go. It may be incorrect, but its not offensive.<br />
<br />
Here is what the class thought the article was saying (and I think they are right) expressed in Logic.<br />
<br />
Note one other thing-- the Prez nominees  might not be the choice of the party (Trump wasn't the choice of the Rep party in 2016, though not clear who was, see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2015/05/the-law-of-excluded-middle-of-road.html">here</a>) but the VP really will be since (I think) the party has more control over that.<br />
<br />
If the Prez Nominees is female then the Vice Prez nominee will be male. (I agree)<br />
<br />
If the Prez Nominees is white mail then the Vice Prez nominee will be either female or non-white but not both. (Great question to express that as symbols. Not sure what I think- the thought is that two white males will be odd since so many of the candidates are female or non-white. Having said that, in recent years the VP has NOT been someone else who ran:  Clinton-Keane, Keane had not been a candidate, Trump-Pence, Pence had not been a candidate, Romney-Ryan, Ryan had not been a candidate, Obama-Biden, Biden had been a candidate briefly in 2008, but this was not one of these `lets unite the party by picking by OPPONENT to be VP', McCain-Palin, Palin had not been a candidate. Kerry-Edwards. YES- Edwards had been a serious candidate in 2004, though some think he was running for VP all along since he never said an unkind word about his opponents)<br />
<br />
Prez from one of the coasts IFF VP from the center. (I won't go over the list again, but this has been less of a thing since Clinton-Gore were both from flyover states.)<br />
<br />
Ideology- If Prez is establishment then VP is leftists. (Not sure these terms are so well defined to say this, and their are other ideologies as well, not sure how they fit in.)<br />
<br />
If Prez lacks Fed Experience then VP should have Fed Exp. (Quite common: Obama-Biden, Romney-Ryan, Clinton-Gore, Bush-Cheney)<br />
<br />If Prez has fed experience than nothing can be deduced about VP Fed Exp.<br />
<br />
If Prez lacks gravitas then VP should have gravitas (tricky! Don't want the VP to outshine the Prez!)<br />
<br />
Absolute statement: VP should not outshine prez. A Kangaroo ticket is when the people prefer the VP to the Prez (Dukakis-Bentsen had this problem. Kerry-Edwards might have).<br />
<br />
If Prez is boring then VP should be exciting. But again tricky! (I think that was why McCain picked Palin. And she was exciting, but not really in a good way. Couldn't he have picked someone exciting, and perhaps female who was, you know, Qualified?)<br />
<br />
VP's like doctors: do no harm.<br />
<br />
VP from Swing state helpful but not necc.<br />
<br />
Bad to have a VP who is a senator from a state where the Governor is republican and picks the replacement senator.<br />
<br />
VP should be someone who the country can picture being president without laughing. I am not talking ideology I am talking about seriousness and experience. Palin was the only one in recent memory who even voters of her party worried that she was not up to being president. One pundit defending the choice talked about how McCain was healthy and hence Palin wouldn't become prez so don't worry about it. NOT reassuring! Quayle was also not seen as serious, though not as much as Palin.<br />
<br />
If Prez is old then VP mattes more(?)<br />
<br />
Many of the above depend on who the Prez is. And that is one of the points: one can write down a long prop formula with many IF-THEN's to determine who properties the VP will have, and then<br />
<br />
1) When the Prez is picked many of the variables are set and hence the formula becomes much easeier and<br />
<br />
2) Could STILL be wrong!<br />
<br />
MY prediction: my last two predictions have been wrong so I am reluctant go predict anything. But I will tell you my WRONG predictions and then my current one<br />
<br />
I predicted Paul Ryan would be the Prez Nominee in 2016. He didn't even run.<br />
<br />
I predicted that Al Franken would be the Prez Nominess in 2020- he understands TV and was an entertainer, so he could match Trump. Whoops.<br />
<br />
So with that sterling record I predict: Prez: Cory Booker, VP: Beto<br />
<br />
I am NOT a pundit- so what I predict is not what I hope happens.  What do I hope? In the interest of full disclosure (gee, shouldn't that have come at the beginning) I admit that I want to see Trump lose but I have no idea what makes someone `electable' nowadays.<br />
<br />

Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) asks to decide if a given truth table of an $n$-variate boolean function has circuit complexity less than a given parameter $s$. We prove that MCSP is hard for constant-depth circuits with mod $p$ gates, for any prime $p\geq 2$ (the circuit class $AC^0[p])$. Namely, we show that MCSP requires $d$-depth $AC^0[p]$ circuits of size at least $exp(N^{0.49/d})$, where $N=2^n$ is the size of an input truth table of an $n$-variate boolean function.  Our circuit lower bound proof shows that MCSP can solve the coin problem: distinguish uniformly random $N$-bit strings from those generated using independent samples from a biased random coin which is $1$ with probability $1/2+N^{-0.49}$, and $0$ otherwise. Solving the coin problem with such parameters is known to require exponentially large $AC^0[p]$ circuits. Moreover, this also implies that MAJORITY is computable by a non-uniform $AC^0$ circuit of polynomial size that also has MCSP-oracle gates. The latter has a few other consequences for the complexity of MCSP, e.g., we get that any boolean function in $NC^1$ (i.e., computable by a polynomial-size formula) can also be computed by a non-uniform polynomial-size $AC^0$ circuit with MCSP-oracle gates.</div>

Tetsuya Miyamoto is a mathematics teacher who divides his time between Tokyo and Manhattan. He is known for creating in 2004 the popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KenKen">KenKen</a> puzzle, which the New York Times started running ten years ago. As with its sister puzzles Sudoku and Kakuro, unlimited-size versions of it are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" />-complete.</p>

From time to time we have tried to raise corresponding questions about <em>concrete</em> complexity that might yield more progress. What catches our eye about the KenKen puzzles is that their generation is a full-blown application within concrete complexity. The NYT’s KenKen puzzles are all generated using software by David Levy that can tailor their hardness. Quoting the NYT anniversary <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/reader-center/kenken-puzzle-10th-anniversary.html">article</a> by Will Shortz:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em>[Levy’s] program knows every possible method for solving a KenKen, which he has rated in difficulty from easy to hard. Thus, when a KenKen has been made, the computer knows exactly how hard it is. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
This seems to say there is a hardness measure that is objective—quite apart from the idea of having human testers try the puzzle and say how hard they found it to be. We surmise that it is lower for instances that have more forced plays at the start. We wonder whether Levy’s criteria can be generalized.</p>
<p>
Incidentally, this is the same Levy who won a challenge chess match in 1978 against the computer Chess 4.7 to complete his win of a famous ten-year $1,000+ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Levy_(chess_player)#Computer_chess_bet">bet</a>. He lost $1,000 back when he was defeated by Deep Thought in 1989. He later became president of the International Computer Games Association (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Computer_Games_Association">ICGA</a>), whose <a href="https://icga.org/?page_id=26"><em>Journal</em></a> published a nice <a href="https://www.cs.wmich.edu/elise/courses/cs431/icga2008.pdf">paper</a> on the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" />-completess of the aforementioned puzzles and many others.</p>

<p></p><p>
GLL’s first <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/02/12/bait-and-switch-why-lower-bounds-are-so-hard/">post</a>, on 12 Feb. 2009, featured Stephen Rudich and his work on the “<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/natural.pdf">Natural</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_proof">Proofs</a>.” <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/02/12/is-np-too-big-or-p-too-small/">Two</a> other <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/02/12/a-nightmare-about-sat/">posts</a> that day covered other aspects of why the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%3DNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P=NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P=NP}}" /> question is hard. Our question, dear readers, is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Has anything happened in the past ten years to make any part of those posts out-of-date in the slightest way? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
We won’t claim any such progress, though we have tried to stir ideas. In the meantime, we have written 806 other posts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Some have featured our own work and ideas (considering Ken’s chess research in a separate vein); <p></p>
</li><li>
some have featured others’ direct attempts at breakthrough lower and upper bounds (with a few successes); <p></p>
</li><li>
many have featured other kinds of results by others; <p></p>
</li><li>
many have pulled “idea nuggets” from the past; <p></p>
</li><li>
many have been humor and social commentary.
</li></ul>
<p>
To date, we’ve had 18,575 comments plus trackbacks on these posts and just over 2.1 million views. We are less able to quantify impacts, beyond occasionally seeing citations of articles on the blog as sources. We try for precision as well as readability and are grateful for reader comments with fixes when we slip up on the former.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> P vs NP </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
There continue to be claims of proofs that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%5Cneq+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}" /> and some that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%3DNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P=NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P=NP}}" /> While these proofs do not seem to be correct, there is something that we wish to remark about them. Many argue as follows: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> There is some problem say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" /> that seems to require a search of exponentially many objects. Then the proof states that any algorithm for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" /> must actually look at all or most of the exponentially many objects. This of course is where the proof is not complete. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
There is some sense to these proofs. They seem related to the oracle proofs that for example show that for some oracle set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> it is the case that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%5E%7BA%7D+%5Cneq+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%5E%7BA%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \mathsf{P}^{A} \neq \mathsf{NP}^{A}. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \mathsf{P}^{A} \neq \mathsf{NP}^{A}. " /></p>
<p>we have discussed these types of proofs before—we even said that we did not like them.</p>
<p>
The trouble with these results that are rigorous is that they change <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P}}" /> vs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" /> in a central manner, and this seems to make the results much less interesting. Roughly here is how they argue: Imagine that for each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> we either put a string of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> or we do not. The point is that if we do this in a <i>unpredictable</i> manner then a polynomial time machine will not be able to decide whether for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> there is or is not a string of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />. But a nondeterministic machine with just use its power and guess. This shows, essentially, that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%5E%7BA%7D+%5Cneq+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%5E%7BA%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \mathsf{P}^{A} \neq \mathsf{NP}^{A} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \mathsf{P}^{A} \neq \mathsf{NP}^{A} " /></p>
<p>is true.</p>
<p>
There is some relationship to many attempts to show <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D+%5Cneq+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}" />. The proofs often argue that one must look at all the objects. The counterpart here is that a polynomial time machine will not have enough time to check the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^{n}}" class="latex" title="{2^{n}}" /> strings of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> to see if they are in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />. But this works in the oracle case because we allow the rule that decides whether or not a string is in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> to be very complicated. In the real world, in the world where we study the real <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D+%5Cneq+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}" /> question, we cannot assume that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BNP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{NP}" class="latex" title="{NP}" />-complete problems use a complicated rule. <i>That is precisely what we are trying to prove</i>.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> State of the Game </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What can we say? Mostly the big open questions remain. We still have no non-linear lower bounds on circuit complexity and no progress of any definite kind on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%3D%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}}" />. What do you think?</p>
<p>
What is commonly hailed as one of the two biggest results in our field last year was a positive solution to what is intuitively a slightly weaker form of the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). For UGC we can refer you to Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_games_conjecture">article</a>:</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/uniquegameswikipedia.png"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/uniquegameswikipedia.png?w=400&amp;h=106" alt="" width="400" class="aligncenter wp-image-15648" height="106" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
The note [2] is in turn a reference to a 2010 <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/05/05/unique-games-a-three-act-play/">post</a> here. The new <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2018/006/">paper</a> proves hardness for the relaxed situation where, roughly speaking, a trial assignment to a node in a constraint graph limits the other node on any connecting edge to at most two possible values, rather than a unique value as in UGC. This relaxation retains many properties that had caused disbelief in the original UGC, yet it was proved—in that sense a big deal. </p>
<p>
Nevertheless we note that UGC, at its core, is just asserting that for arbitrarily small <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon}" />, with our power to make other parameter(s) as large as desired, we can execute an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" />-hardness proof. We have been executing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" />-hardness proofs for almost fifty years. That is something we in the field have proven good at. True, these hardness results becomes lower bound proofs if and when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP+%5Cneq+P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP \neq P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP \neq P}}" /> is proved, and true, we have been as vocal as any on the standpoint that significant lower bounds will come from constructions that are usually thought of as being for upper bounds. But the new proof from a year ago doesn’t feel like that. We invite readers to tell us connections from UGC to the possibility of actually constructing lower bounds.</p>

Last Monday, 11 February, was the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/women-and-girls-in-science-day/" target="_blank">International Day of Women in Science</a>. I planned to post the answers I received from three junior female computer scientists to three questions I asked them. However, being a computer scientist who is short of time like everyone else, I asked for a one-week deadline extension to do so.<br /><br />The questions were <br /><ol><li>When did you become interested in science?</li><li>Why did you choose computer science?</li><li>Which advice would you give to a high-school student who is thinking about pursuing a career in science?  </li></ol>Here are the (unedited) answers in the order in which I received them, in case they might be of interest to (female) students of all ages. I have anonymized the answers as the message is more important than the messengers. <br /><br />Colleague #1<br /><br /><ol><li>I never had a sentence like "I am interested in science" in my mind, it  was just that I always in one way or another enjoyed learning about  things, school and education, and I wanted to continue being in that  type of surroundings after graduating from university. </li><li>I actually studied mathematics, I was not interested in computer  science. I had some algorithms and programming classes during my  studies, which I found cute but not much more than that. I started being  seriously interested in computer science only when I took a class on  mathematical theory of computation. This class combined the  mathematical/theoretical/<div>philosophical approach I liked so much with (for me) a new and refreshing set of questions. </div></li><li> Try it and see how it goes. </li></ol>Colleague #2<br /><br /><ol><li>My interest in science started when visiting the SMAU that is an     event where companies, investors and startups aim to promote the     Made in Italy Research and Innovation. It was simply amazing to     learn about startups, laboratories, research centres, universities     and small companies showing so many novel ideas and technologies in     one day, it really impressed me a lot. </li><li>Computer science was the alternative to Math (my preferred subject     at the scientific high school) but I thought it was too abstract and     full of theories, demonstrations and proofs, maybe too much.     Computer science has the theoretical part that is fascinating but it     also has some more practical implications, it is somehow more     concrete, and I like both sides. </li><li>Don't be afraid to fail, be afraid not to try. I think it is     worthwhile to try if you have any inclination to science because you     are exposed to problem solving reasoning, and these efforts can be     helpful for building a better society.<span class="im"></span> </li></ol>Colleague #3<br /><br /><ol><li style="margin-left: 15px;">From the junior secondary school, scientific subjects were my favorites, together with history.</li><li style="margin-left: 15px;">During the high school, I started to study computer science and also  laboratory of computer science where it was applied to other subjects  such as Math and Business Economics. I was really passionate of this  subject, which was among my favorite. When it was time to choose for the  University, computer science was naturally the first in the list. I  also had other alternatives but in the end I quickly decided to apply  for computer science.</li><li style="margin-left: 15px;">My advice is simply to do whatever he/she really likes and for which  he/she is good and has obtained good results, without thinking too much  about work opportunities or what other people (e.g., parents) want for  them. For each career, in science or not, passion is the main ingredient  to reach good results. Then, I also think that one can change his/her  mind and do something completely different after the university. The  important is to study what one really likes.</li></ol><br /><br /></div>

<h2></h2>
<p>In this post  I would like to tell you about three papers and three theorems. I am thankful to Moshe White and Imre Barany for helpful discussions.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07197">a) Universality of vector sequences and universality of Tverberg partitions,</a> by Attila Por;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Theorem (Por’s universality result, 2018):</strong> Every long enough sequence of points in general position in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb R^d" class="latex" title="\mathbb R^d" />  contains a subsequence of length <em><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-16-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-98"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-99"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-100">n</span></span></span></span></em> whose Tverberg partitions are exactly the so called rainbow partitions.</p>
<p class="title mathjax"><strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01078">b) Classifying unavoidable Tverberg partitions</a>, by <a href="http://www.borisbukh.org/">Boris Bukh</a>, <a href="http://www.math.cmu.edu/~ploh/">Po-Shen Loh</a>, <a href="http://www.gabrielnivasch.org/">Gabriel Nivasch</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Theorem (Bukh, Loh, and Nivasch, 2017):</strong> Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> be a tree-like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="r" class="latex" title="r" />-uniform simple hypergraph with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d+1" class="latex" title="d+1" /> edges and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D%28d%2B1%29%28r-1%29%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n=(d+1)(r-1)+1" class="latex" title="n=(d+1)(r-1)+1" /> edges. It is possible to associate to the vertices of each such hypergraph H a set X of n points in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb R^d" class="latex" title="\mathbb R^d" /> so that the Tverberg partitions of X correspond precisely to rainbow coloring of the hypergraph H. Moreover, the number of rainbow coloring is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29%21%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(r-1)!^d" class="latex" title="(r-1)!^d" />. (Here, we consider two colorings as the same if they differ by a permutation of the colors.)</p>

<h2>Radon’s and Tverberg’s theorems and Sierksma’s conjecture</h2>
<p>Recall the beautiful theorem of Tverberg: (We devoted two posts (<a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/11/24/sarkarias-proof-of-tverbergs-theorem-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Tverberg 1">I</a>, <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/11/26/sarkarias-proof-of-tverbergs-theorem-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Tverberg 2">II</a>) to its background and proof.)</p>
<p><strong>Tverberg Theorem (1965): </strong>Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2Cx_2%2C%5Cdots%2C+x_m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x_1,x_2,\dots, x_m" class="latex" title="x_1,x_2,\dots, x_m" /> be points in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^d" class="latex" title="R^d" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m+%5Cge+%28r-1%29%28d%2B1%29%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="m \ge (r-1)(d+1)+1" class="latex" title="m \ge (r-1)(d+1)+1" />. Then there is a partition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_1%2CS_2%2C%5Cdots%2C+S_r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S_1,S_2,\dots, S_r" class="latex" title="S_1,S_2,\dots, S_r" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B1%2C2%2C%5Cdots%2Cm%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\{1,2,\dots,m\}" class="latex" title="\{1,2,\dots,m\}" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccap+_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5Erconv+%28x_i%3A+i+%5Cin+S_j%29+%5Cne+%5Cemptyset&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\cap _{j=1}^rconv (x_i: i \in S_j) \ne \emptyset" class="latex" title="\cap _{j=1}^rconv (x_i: i \in S_j) \ne \emptyset" />.</p>
<p>The (much easier) case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3D2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="r=2" class="latex" title="r=2" /> of Tverberg’s theorem is <strong>Radon’s theorem</strong>.</p>
<p>We devoted a post to <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/12/23/seven-problems-around-tverbergs-theorem/">seven open problems related to Tverberg’s theorem</a>, and one of them was:</p>
<p><strong>Sierksma Conjecture:</strong> The number of Tverberg’s <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="r" class="latex" title="r" />-partitions of a set of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29%28d%2B1%29%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(r-1)(d+1)+1" class="latex" title="(r-1)(d+1)+1" /> points in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^d" class="latex" title="R^d" /> is at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%28r-1%29%21%29%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="((r-1)!)^d" class="latex" title="((r-1)!)^d" />.</p>
<p>Gerard Sierksma’s construction with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29%21%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(r-1)!^d" class="latex" title="(r-1)!^d" /> Tverberg’s partition is obtained by taking <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(r-1)" class="latex" title="(r-1)" /> copies of each vertex of a simplex containing the origin in its interior, and adding the origin itself. A configuration of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29%28d%2B1%29%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(r-1)(d+1)+1" class="latex" title="(r-1)(d+1)+1" /> points in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^d" class="latex" title="R^d" /> with precisely <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%28r-1%29%21%29%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="((r-1)!)^d" class="latex" title="((r-1)!)^d" /> Tverberg partitions to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="r" class="latex" title="r" /> parts is called a <strong>Sierksma Configuration</strong>.</p>
<h2>White’s Theorem</h2>
<p>In 2015 Moshe White proved the following theorem which was an open problem for many years. White’s construction was surprisingly simple.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 1 (White, 2015):</strong>  For any partition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2Ca_2%2C%5Cdots+%2Ca_r%3A+1+%5Cle+a_i%5Cle+d%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="a_1,a_2,\dots ,a_r: 1 \le a_i\le d+1" class="latex" title="a_1,a_2,\dots ,a_r: 1 \le a_i\le d+1" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" />, there exists a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Csubset+%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="X \subset \mathbb R^d" class="latex" title="X \subset \mathbb R^d" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" />  points, such that every Tverberg partition of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="X" class="latex" title="X" />  induces the same partition on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> given by the parts <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C%5Cdots%2Ca_r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="a_1,\dots,a_r" class="latex" title="a_1,\dots,a_r" />. Moreover, the number of Tverberg’s partitions of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="X" class="latex" title="X" /> is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29%21%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(r-1)!^d" class="latex" title="(r-1)!^d" /></p>
<h2>Bukh, Loh, and Nivasch’s  examples via staircase convexity.</h2>
<h2><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/cascade-tverberg.png"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/cascade-tverberg.png?w=640&amp;h=463" alt="" width="640" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16844" height="463" /></a></h2>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Five tree-like simple hypergraphs that correspond to configurations of 11 points in 4-dimensional space.</span></strong></p>
<p>Start with a tree-like hypergraph H of d+1 blocks of size r like the five examples in the Figure above. The intersection of every two blocks has at most one element. The union of all blocks has n=(d+1)(r-1)+1 elements.</p>
<p>A <strong>rainbow coloring</strong> of a r-uniform hypergraph H is a coloring of the vertices of H with r colors so that the vertices of every edge is colored by all r colors.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 2 (Bukh, Loh, and Nivasch):</strong> It is possible to associate to the vertices of each such hypergraph H a set X of n points in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb R^d" class="latex" title="\mathbb R^d" /> so that the Tverberg partitions of X correspond precisely to rainbow coloring of the hypergraph H. Moreover, the number of rainbow coloring is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29%21%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(r-1)!^d" class="latex" title="(r-1)!^d" />. (Here, we consider two colorings as the same if they differ by a permutation of the colors.)</p>
<p>For a star-like hypergraph where all blocks have a vertex in common we get the original Sierksma’s example. (Example (d) above.) White’s examples are obtained by considering such hypergraphs where there exists an edge <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A" class="latex" title="A" /> such that all edges have non empty intersection with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A" class="latex" title="A" />. (Examples (c), (d), and (e) above).</p>

<h2>Tverberg’s partitions for stretched points on the moment curve</h2>
<p>It is natural to consider $n$ points on the moment curve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29%3D%28t%2Ct%5E2%2C%5Cdots%2C+t%5Ed%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x(t)=(t,t^2,\dots, t^d)" class="latex" title="x(t)=(t,t^2,\dots, t^d)" />. It turns out that the set of Tverberg’s partitions for points on the moment curve depend on the precise location of the points. By stretched points on the moment curve I mean that  you take the points <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t_1%29%2C+x%28t_2%29%2C+%5Cdots+x%28t_n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x(t_1), x(t_2), \dots x(t_n)" class="latex" title="x(t_1), x(t_2), \dots x(t_n)" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t_1+%3C%3C+t_2+%3C%3C+%5Cdots+t_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="t_1 &lt;&lt; t_2 &lt;&lt; \dots t_n" class="latex" title="t_1 &lt;&lt; t_2 &lt;&lt; \dots t_n" />, namely $t_2$ is much much larger than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="t_1" class="latex" title="t_1" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t_3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="t_3" class="latex" title="t_3" /> is much much much much larger than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="t_2" class="latex" title="t_2" />, etc. etc. In this case, the configuration corresponds to a <strong>path</strong> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" />: you let the vertices be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B1%2C2%2C%5Cdots%2Cn%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\{1,2,\dots,n\}" class="latex" title="\{1,2,\dots,n\}" /> and the edges are sets of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B%28k-1%29%28r-1%29%2B1%2C+%28k-1%29%28r-1%29%2B2%2C%5Cdots+%2C+k%28r-1%29%2B1%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\{(k-1)(r-1)+1, (k-1)(r-1)+2,\dots , k(r-1)+1\}" class="latex" title="\{(k-1)(r-1)+1, (k-1)(r-1)+2,\dots , k(r-1)+1\}" />. A stretched configuration of points on the moment curve has the property that every subset is also a stretched configuration of points on the moment curve.</p>
<p>The importance of Tverberg’s partitions for stretched points on the moment curve was realized by Barany and Por, by Bukh, Loh, and Nivasch, and by Perles and Sidron (See their paper <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-016-9813-3">Tverberg Partitions of Points on the Moment Curve</a>), and perhaps by others as well.</p>
<h2>Por’s universality result</h2>
<p>Por’s universality theorem asserts that in terms of Tverberg partitions every large enough configuration of points in general position in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^d" class="latex" title="R^d" /> contains a configuration whose Tverberg partitions are those of a stretched configuration of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> points on the moment curve! Por’s  universality result was conjectured independently by Bukh, Loh, and Nivasch, (and they gave some partial results) and by Por himself.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 3 (Por’s universality result, 2018):</strong> Every long enough sequence of points in <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-15-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-91"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-92"><span class="msubsup" id="MathJax-Span-93"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-97"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb R^d" class="latex" title="\mathbb R^d" /></span></span></span></span></span> in general position contains a subsequence  of length <em><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-16-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-98"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-99"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-100">n</span></span></span></span></em> whose Tverberg partitions are exactly the so called rainbow partitions.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Por actually proved an apparently stronger statement: We can find a subsequence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="Y" class="latex" title="Y" /> so the conclusion holds not only for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="Y" class="latex" title="Y" /> but also for every subsequence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="Z" class="latex" title="Z" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="Y" class="latex" title="Y" />. </span></p>
<h2>Staircase Convexity</h2>
<p>The work of Bukh, Loh, and Nivasch relied on an important method of “staircase convexity”. An earlier 2001 application of the method (where it was introduced) was for lower bounds on weak epsilon nets by Bukh, Matousek, and Nivasch (Here are links to the paper, and to <a href="http://www.borisbukh.org/geomselthms_talk.pdf">slides from a talk by Boris Bukh</a>. See also <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2007/04/22/gil-kalai-the-weak-epsilon-net-problem/">this post</a> and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/04/05/nathan-rubin-improved-the-bound-for-planar-weak-%CE%B5-nets-and-other-news-from-ein-gedi/">this one</a> of the weak epsilon net problem.) Roughly the idea is this: consider a stretched grid where the sequence of coordinates are very very fast growing. When you choose configuration of points in such a grid, questions regarding their convex hulls translate to purely combinatorial problems.</p>

<h2>Erdos Szekeres in the plane and higher dimensions</h2>
<h3>The planar case</h3>
<p>Let <em><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-1"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-2"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-3">E</span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-4">S</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-5">(</span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-6">n</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-7">)</span></span></span></span></em> be the smallest integer such that any set of <em><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-2-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-8"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-9"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-10">E</span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-11">S</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-12">(</span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-13">n</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-14">)</span></span></span></span></em> points in the plane in general position contains <em><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-3-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-15"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-16"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-17">n</span></span></span></span></em> points in convex position. In their <a href="http://archive.numdam.org/ARCHIVE/CM/CM_1935__2_/CM_1935__2__463_0/CM_1935__2__463_0.pdf">seminal 1935 paper</a>, Erdős and Szekeres showed that <em>ES(n)</em> is finite.</p>
<p>The finiteness of ES(n) can be stated as follows: Given a sequence of N points in general position in the plane <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2Cx_2%2C+%5Cdots+%2C+x_N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x_1,x_2, \dots , x_N" class="latex" title="x_1,x_2, \dots , x_N" />  there is a subsequence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1_i%2Cx_2%2C+%5Cdots+%2C+x_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="1_i,x_2, \dots , x_n" class="latex" title="1_i,x_2, \dots , x_n" /> such that the line segments <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Bx_i%2Cx_k%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="[x_i,x_k]" class="latex" title="[x_i,x_k]" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Bx_j%2Cx_%5Cell+%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="[x_j,x_\ell ]" class="latex" title="[x_j,x_\ell ]" /> intersect. With this statement, the Erdős and Szekeres’ theorem can be seen as identifying a universal set of points in term of its <em>Radon partitions </em>(or equivalently in terms of its <em>order type</em>).</p>
<h3>In high dimensions</h3>
<p>In higher dimensions we can define <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ES_d%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="ES_d(n)" class="latex" title="ES_d(n)" /> and replace “in convex position” by “in cyclic position”.

<h3>Por’s result</h3>
<p>Por’s result can be seen as a far-reaching strengthening of the finiteness of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ES_d%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="ES_d(n)" class="latex" title="ES_d(n)" />.</p>
<h2>Further Discussion:</h2>
<h3>High order order types?</h3>
<p>Can you base a higher-order notion of “order types” on Tverberg partitions?</p>
<p>The <strong>order type</strong> of a sequence of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> points affinely spanning <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^d" class="latex" title="R^d" />, is the described by the vector of signs (0, 1 or -1) of volume of simplices described by subsequences of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d+1" class="latex" title="d+1" />. Equivalently the order type can be described by the minimal Radon partitions of the points.</p>
<ol>
<li>We can first ask if we can base a notion of higher order types on Tverberg’s partitions to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="r" class="latex" title="r" /> parts where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="r&gt;2" class="latex" title="r&gt;2" />.</li>
<li>Next we can ask for an associated notion of “higher order oriented matroids.” (Oriented matroids in the usual sense are abstract order types which coincide with Euclidean order types for every subsequence of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%2B3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d+3" class="latex" title="d+3" /> points.)</li>
<li>A natural question regarding these “higher order types is: If a sequence of points in strong general position is Tverberg-equivalent to stretched points on the moment curve, does it apply to all of its subsequences?</li>
</ol>
<p>Another way to consider “higher” order types is to enlarge the family by to start with a family of points add to it all Radon points of minimal Radon’s partition and consider the order type of the new configuration. (This operation can be repeated <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="r" class="latex" title="r" /> times.) See <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00147418">this paper of Michael Kallay on point sets which contain their Radon points</a>.</p>
<h3>Staircase convexity order types</h3>
<p>Understanding order types of configuration of points on stretched grids of Bukh et al. is a very interesting problem. It is interesting to understand such configurations that are not in general position as well. (In particular, which matroids are supported on the stretched grid?) Of course, the method may well have many more applications.</p>
<h3>Fantastically strong forms of Sierksma’s conjecture</h3>
<p>Is the following true: For every sequence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D%28r-1%29%28d%2B1%29%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n=(r-1)(d+1)+1" class="latex" title="n=(r-1)(d+1)+1" /> points in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^d" class="latex" title="R^d" /> there is a Sierksma’s configuration <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> of $n$ points so that every Tverberg’s partition of  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> is a Tverberg’s partition of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" />?</p>
<p>An even stronger version is:</p>
<p>Does every sequence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29%28d%2B1%29%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(r-1)(d+1)+1" class="latex" title="(r-1)(d+1)+1" /> points in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^d" class="latex" title="R^d" /> there is a tree-like simple hypergraph so that all the rainbow coloring of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> correspond to Tverberg partitions of the sequence? If true this will be a fantastically strong version of Sierksma’s conjecture.</p>
<h3>Is the Erdős-Szekeres’ conjecture outrageous?</h3>
<p>Erdős and Szekeres proved in 1935 that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ES%28n%29%5Cle+%7B%7B2n-4%7D%5Cchoose%7Bn-2%7D%7D%2B1%3D4%5E%7Bn-o%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="ES(n)\le {{2n-4}\choose{n-2}}+1=4^{n-o(n)}" class="latex" title="ES(n)\le {{2n-4}\choose{n-2}}+1=4^{n-o(n)}" />, and in 1960, they showed that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ES%28n%29+%5Cge+2%5E%7Bn-2%7D%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="ES(n) \ge 2^{n-2}+1" class="latex" title="ES(n) \ge 2^{n-2}+1" />, and conjectured this to be optimal. Despite the efforts of many researchers, until recently no improvement in the order of magnitude has ever been made on the upper bound over  81 years. A  recent breakthrough result by Andrew Suk (Here are links<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08657"> to the paper</a>, and to<a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2016/05/04/the-erdos-szekeres-polygon-problem-solved-asymptotically-by-andrew-suk/"> our post discussing the result</a>) asserts that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ES%28n%29%3D2%5E%7Bn%2Bo%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="ES(n)=2^{n+o(n)}" class="latex" title="ES(n)=2^{n+o(n)}" />. <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/259844/the-most-outrageous-or-ridiculous-conjectures-in-mathematics">Sometime ago I asked over MO a question on outrageous mathematical conjectures</a> and perhaps the conjecture that  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ES%28n%29+%3D+2%5E%7Bn-2%7D%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="ES(n) = 2^{n-2}+1" class="latex" title="ES(n) = 2^{n-2}+1" /> on the nose is an example.</p>

<h3>Henry Cohn, Abhinav Kumar, Stephen D. Miller, Danylo Radchenko, and Maryna Viazovska: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05438">Universal optimality of the E8 and Leech lattices and interpolation formulas</a></h3>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>We prove that the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E_8&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="E_8" class="latex" title="E_8" /> root lattice and the Leech lattice are universally optimal among point configurations in Euclidean spaces of dimensions 8 and 24, respectively. In other words, they minimize energy for every potential function that is a completely monotonic function of squared distance (for example, inverse power laws or Gaussians), which is a strong form of robustness not previously known for any configuration in more than one dimension. This theorem implies their recently shown optimality as sphere packings, and broadly generalizes it to allow for long-range interactions.</p>
<p>The proof uses sharp linear programming bounds for energy. To construct the optimal auxiliary functions used to attain these bounds, we prove a new interpolation theorem, which is of independent interest. It reconstructs a radial Schwartz function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> from the values and radial derivatives of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> and its Fourier transform <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat+f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\hat f" class="latex" title="\hat f" /> at the radii √2π for integers <em>n ≥ 1</em> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5E8&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^8" class="latex" title="R^8" /> and <em>n ≥ 2</em> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5E%7B24%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^{24}" class="latex" title="R^{24}" />. To prove this theorem, we construct an interpolation basis using integral transforms of quasimodular forms, generalizing Viazovska’s work on sphere packing and placing it in the context of a more conceptual theory.</p></div>
