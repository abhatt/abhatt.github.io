<div style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">One social contribution that I tentatively attribute to Uber is popularisation of the concept of surge pricing. That is, we try to call an Uber and all-too-frequently get told that we have to pay a premium at this particular point in time, due to high demand. On the other hand, recent shortages of toilet paper, paracetamol, and certain foods were not accompanied by any kind of surge pricing, and the limits imposed on how much stuff you can buy, were not so effective in keeping these goods available. At this point, things have improved, although I have not been able to buy flour recently: the shortage of flour in the supermarkets I visit seems to be chronic.<br /><br />Now I appreciate the objection to charging to charging a premium to allcomers, rich and poor alike, in the context of vital food and medicine. (Although, limits on purchases can also be criticised as being unfair to a single purchaser buying for a large family, or a key worker who is short of time and doesn't want to search excessively for a desired item.) In trying to advocate surge pricing, let me turn instead to possible examples less controversial, such as hairdressers and garden centres. When these establishments are allowed to reopen, it seems reasonable that they should charge a premium (temporarily). Not only do they need the money, but it would help to control a flood of customers all causing long queues and infecting each other at close quarters. To be honest, I’m not optimistic that this will happen, since they will still worry about accusations of price-gouging, plus there’s the question of how big a premium is appropriate.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/04/25/the-impossibility-of-measuring-inflation-in-a-pandemic">An article in the Economist</a> highlights a related problem, which is the difficulty of measuring the rate of inflation, at a time when various goods and services (whose prices get used to measure inflation) are unavailable. Coming back to flour, it may be felt that some of it (not all!) should be sold at market price, meaning one that some people will pay, but where it stays on the shelves for a few days, at least. There is a moral case against selling goods too cheaply, which is that it becomes an attempt to hide a problem — a successful attempt, if inflation cannot be measured.<br /><br />Finally, the problem discussed here touches on a defect at the heart of traditional economic theory, which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%E2%80%93Debreu_model">celebrated existence</a> of “correct” prices, unaccompanied by a means of arriving at those prices. The Algorithmic Game Theory community has quite rightly worried about price discovery and its computational obstacles. But the obstacles are also social, and status quo bias plays a big part.</div></div>

<div style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">I managed to join a zoom meeting yesterday to honor John Conway. Peter Winkler paid tribute with a story about the brick-stacking puzzle (was interesting to hear "skintle" in context of puzzles). Roger Penrose paid tribute with tilings but also an old classic,  Morley's Trisector Theorem. Others like Don Knuth appeared in the pre-meeting chat room, but I could not stay for the entire 3 hrs+ homage.

Proving super-logarithmic data structure lower bounds in the static \emph{group model} has been a fundamental challenge in computational geometry since the early 80's. We prove a polynomial ($n^{\Omega(1)}$) lower bound for an explicit range counting problem of $n^3$ convex polygons in $\R^2$ (each with $n^{\tilde{O}(1)}$ facets/semialgebraic-complexity), against linear storage arithmetic data structures in the group model. Our construction and analysis are based on a combination of techniques in Diophantine approximation, pseudorandomness, and compressed sensing---in particular, on the existence and partial derandomization of optimal \emph{binary} compressed sensing matrices in the polynomial sparsity regime ($k = n^{1-\delta}$). As a byproduct, this establishes a (logarithmic) separation between compressed sensing matrices and the stronger RIP property.</div>

The study of branching programs for the Tree Evaluation Problem, introduced by S. Cook et al. (TOCT 2012), remains one of the most promising approaches to separating L from P. Given a label in $[k]$ at each leaf of a complete binary tree and an explicit function  in $[k]^2 \to [k]$ for recursively computing the value of each internal node from its children, the problem is to compute the value at the root node. The problem is parameterized by the alphabet size $k$ and the height $h$ of the tree. A branching program implementing the straightforward recursive algorithm uses $\Theta((k + 1)^h)$ states, organized into $2^h-1$ layers of width up to $k^h$. Until now no better deterministic algorithm was known.

We present a series of three new algorithms solving the Tree Evaluation Problem. They are inspired by the work of Buhrman et al. on catalytic space (STOC 2012), applied outside the catalytic-space setting. First we give a novel branching program with $2^{4h} poly(k)$ layers of width $2^{3k}$, which beats the straightforward algorithm when $h = \omega(k / \log k)$. Next we give a branching program with $k^{2h} poly(k)$ layers of width $k^3$.  This has total size comparable to the straightforward algorithm, but is implemented using the catalytic framework. Finally we interpolate between the two algorithms to give a branching program with $(O(k/h))^{2h} poly(k)$ layers of width $(O(k/h))^{\epsilon h}$ for any constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$, which beats the straightforward algorithm for all $h \geq k^{1/2 + poly(\epsilon)}$. These are the first deterministic branching programs to beat the straightforward algorithm, but more importantly this is the first non-trivial approach to proving deterministic upper bounds for Tree Evaluation.

We also contribute new machinery to the catalytic computing program, which may be of independent interest to some readers.</div>

factorization, which can be sped up significantly for large sparse matrices by
interpreting the matrix as a sparse graph and computing a node ordering that
minimizes the so-called fill-in. In this paper, we engineer new data reduction
rules for the minimum fill-in problem, which significantly reduce the size of
the graph while producing an equivalent (or near-equivalent) instance. By
applying both new and existing data reduction rules exhaustively before nested
dissection, we obtain improved quality and at the same time large improvements
in running time on a variety of instances. Our overall algorithm outperforms
the state-of-the-art significantly: it not only yields better elimination
orders, but it does so significantly faster than previously possible. For
example, on road networks, where nested dissection algorithms are typically
used as a preprocessing step for shortest path computations, our algorithms are
on average six times faster than Metis while computing orderings with less
fill-in.

with bounded diameter. We prove that the $k$-List Coloring, List $k$-Coloring,
and $k$-Precoloring Extension problems are NP-complete on bipartite graphs with
diameter at most $d$, for every $k\ge 4$ and every $d\ge 3$, and for $k=3$ and
$d\ge 4$, and that List $k$-Coloring is polynomial when $d=2$ (i.e., on
complete bipartite graphs) for every $k \geq 3$. Since $k$-List Coloring was
already known to be NP-complete on complete bipartite graphs, and polynomial
for $k=2$ on general graphs, the only remaining open problems are List
$3$-Coloring and $3$-Precoloring Extension when $d=3$.
</p>
<p>We also prove that the Surjective $C_6$-Homomorphism problem is NP-complete
on bipartite graphs with diameter at most $4$, answering a question posed by
Bodirsky, K\'ara, and Martin [Discret. Appl. Math. 2012]. As a byproduct, we
get that deciding whether $V(G)$ can be partitioned into 3 subsets each
inducing a complete bipartite graph is NP-complete. An attempt to prove this
result was presented by Fleischner, Mujuni, Paulusma, and Szeider [Theor.
Comput. Sci. 2009], but we realized that there was an apparently non-fixable
flaw in their proof.
</p>
<p>Finally, we prove that the $3$-Fall Coloring problem is NP-complete on
bipartite graphs with diameter at most $4$, and give a polynomial reduction
from $3$-Fall Coloring on bipartite graphs with diameter $3$ to $3$-Precoloring
Extension on bipartite graphs with diameter $3$. The latter result implies that
if $3$-Fall Coloring is NP-complete on these graphs, then the complexity gaps
mentioned above for List $k$-Coloring and $k$-Precoloring Extension would be
closed. This would also answer a question posed by Kratochv\'il, Tuza, and
Voigt [Proc. of WG 2002].

set $P$ of pairs of two points in the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$, we are
required to find a minimum-length geometric network which consists of
axis-aligned segments and contains a shortest path in the $L_1$ metric (a
so-called Manhattan path) for each pair in $P$. This problem commonly

<p>As a bottom-up exploration, Schnizler (2015) focused on the intersection

polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm for the GMMN problem whose input

intersection graph are bounded by constants. In this paper, as the first
attempt to remove the degree bound, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for
the star case, and extend it to the general tree case based on an improved
dynamic programming approach.

problems in the classical centralized setting, where the entire dataset is
available to the single processor performing the computation. Adaptive sampling
repeatedly selects rows of an underlying matrix
$\mathbf{A}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, where $n\gg d$, with probabilities
proportional to their distances to the subspace of the previously selected
rows. Intuitively, adaptive sampling seems to be limited to trivial multi-pass
algorithms in the streaming model of computation due to its inherently
sequential nature of assigning sampling probabilities to each row only after
the previous iteration is completed. Surprisingly, we show this is not the case
by giving the first one-pass algorithms for adaptive sampling on turnstile
streams and using space $\text{poly}(d,k,\log n)$, where $k$ is the number of
adaptive sampling rounds to be performed.
</p>
<p>Our adaptive sampling procedure has a number of applications to various data
summarization problems that either improve state-of-the-art or have only been
previously studied in the more relaxed row-arrival model. We give the first
relative-error algorithms for column subset selection, subspace approximation,
projective clustering, and volume maximization on turnstile streams that use
space sublinear in $n$. We complement our volume maximization algorithmic
results with lower bounds that are tight up to lower order terms, even for
multi-pass algorithms. By a similar construction, we also obtain lower bounds
for volume maximization in the row-arrival model, which we match with
competitive upper bounds.

making the need to run queries on large datasets increasingly important.
Technologies such as columnar block-based data organization and compression
have become standard practice in most commercial database systems. However, the
problem of best assigning records to data blocks on storage is still open. For
example, today's systems usually partition data by arrival time into row
groups, or range/hash partition the data based on selected fields. For a given
workload, however, such techniques are unable to optimize for the important
metric of the number of blocks accessed by a query. This metric directly
relates to the I/O cost, and therefore performance, of most analytical queries.
Further, they are unable to exploit additional available storage to drive this
metric down further.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose a new framework called a query-data routing tree,
or qd-tree, to address this problem, and propose two algorithms for their
construction based on greedy and deep reinforcement learning techniques.
Experiments over benchmark and real workloads show that a qd-tree can provide
physical speedups of more than an order of magnitude compared to current
blocking schemes, and can reach within 2X of the lower bound for data skipping
based on selectivity, while providing complete semantic descriptions of created
blocks.

vertex separators under the three most popular rules: token addition/removal,
token jumping, and token sliding. We show that, aside from some trivially
negative instances, the first two rules are equivalent to each other and that,
even if only on a subclass of bipartite graphs, TJ is not equivalent to the
other two unless $\mathsf{NP} = \mathsf{PSPACE}$; we do this by showing a
relationship between separators and independent sets in this subclass of
bipartite graphs. In terms of polynomial time algorithms, we show that every
class with a polynomially bounded number of minimal vertex separators admits an
efficient algorithm under token jumping, then turn our attention to two classes
that do not meet this condition: $\{3P_1, diamond\}$-free and series-parallel
graphs. For the first, we describe a novel characterization, which we use to
show that reconfiguring vertex separators under token jumping is always
possible and that, under token sliding, it can be done in polynomial time; for
series-parallel graphs, we also prove that reconfiguration is always possible
under TJ and exhibit a polynomial time algorithm to construct the
reconfiguration sequence.

generally for undirected graphical models. Given sample access to the Gibbs
distribution corresponding to an unknown or hidden model $M^*$ and given an
explicit model $M$, can we distinguish if either $M = M^*$ or if they are
(statistically) far apart? Daskalakis et al. (2018) presented a polynomial-time
algorithm for identity testing for the ferromagnetic (attractive) Ising model.
In contrast, for the antiferromagnetic (repulsive) Ising model, Bez\'akov\'a et
al. (2019) proved that unless $RP=NP$ there is no identity testing algorithm
when $\beta d=\omega(\log{n})$, where $d$ is the maximum degree of the visible
graph and $\beta$ is the largest edge weight in absolute value.
</p>
<p>We prove analogous hardness results for RBMs (i.e., mixed Ising models on
bipartite graphs), even when there are no latent variables or an external
field. Specifically, we show that if $RP \neq NP$, then when $\beta
d=\omega(\log{n})$ there is no polynomial-time algorithm for identity testing
for RBMs; when $\beta d =O(\log{n})$ there is an efficient identity testing
algorithm that utilizes the structure learning algorithm of Klivans and Meka
(2017). In addition, we prove similar lower bounds for purely ferromagnetic
RBMs with inconsistent external fields, and for the ferromagnetic Potts model.
Previous hardness results for identity testing of Bez\'akov\'a et al. (2019)
utilized the hardness of finding the maximum cuts, which corresponds to the
ground states of the antiferromagnetic Ising model. Since RBMs are on bipartite
graphs such an approach is not feasible. We instead introduce a general
methodology to reduce from the corresponding approximate counting problem and
utilize the phase transition that is exhibited by RBMs and the mean-field Potts
model.

uniformly-related machines in the presence of an arbitrary, fixed communication
delay $\rho$. We consider a model that allows job duplication, i.e. processing
of the same job on multiple machines, which, as we show, can reduce the length
of a schedule (i.e., its makespan) by a logarithmic factor. Our main result is
an $O(\log m \log \rho / \log \log \rho)$-approximation algorithm for
minimizing makespan, assuming the minimum makespan is at least $\rho$. Our
algorithm is based on rounding a linear programming relaxation for the problem,
which includes carefully designed constraints capturing the interaction among
communication delay, precedence requirements, varying speeds, and job
duplication. Our result builds on two previous lines of work, one with
communication delay but identical machines (Lepere, Rapine 2002) and the other
with uniformly-related machines but no communication delay (Chudak, Shmoys
1999). We next show that the integrality gap of our mathematical program is
$\Omega(\sqrt{\log \rho})$. Our gap construction employs expander graphs and
exploits a property of robust expansion and its generalization to paths of
longer length. Finally, we quantify the advantage of duplication in scheduling
with communication delay. We show that the best schedule without duplication
can have makespan $\Omega(\rho/\log \rho)$ or $\Omega(\log m/\log\log m)$ or
$\Omega(\log n/\log \log n)$ times that of an optimal schedule allowing
duplication. Nevertheless, we present a polynomial time algorithm to transform
any schedule to a schedule without duplication at the cost of a $O(\log^2 n
\log m)$ factor increase in makespan. Together with our makespan approximation
algorithm for schedules allowing duplication, this also yields a
polylogarithmic-approximation algorithm for the setting where duplication is
not allowed.

<p>This blog post concerns our <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07454.pdf">ICLR20 paper</a> on a surprising discovery about learning rate (LR), the most basic hyperparameter in deep learning.</p>

<p>As illustrated in many online blogs, setting LR too small  might slow down the optimization, and setting it too large  might make the network overshoot the area of low losses. The standard mathematical analysis for  the right choice of LR relates it to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothness">smoothness</a> of the loss function.</p>

<p>Many practitioners use a ‘step decay’ LR schedule, which systematically drops the LR after specific training epochs. One often hears the intuition—with some mathematical justification if one treats SGD as a random walk in the  loss landscape— that large learning rates are useful in the initial (“exploration”) phase of training whereas lower rates  in later epochs allow a slow settling down to a local minimum in the landscape. Intriguingly, this intuition is called into  question by the success of exotic learning rate schedules such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03983">cosine</a> (Loshchilov&amp;Hutter, 2016), and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01186">triangular</a> (Smith, 2015), featuring an oscillatory LR.  These divergent approaches suggest that LR, the most basic and intuitive hyperparameter in deep learning, has not revealed all its mysteries yet.</p>

<h1 id="surprise-exponentially-increasing-lr">Surprise: Exponentially increasing LR</h1>

<p>We report experiments that state-of-the-art networks for image recognition tasks can be trained with an exponentially increasing LR (ExpLR): in each iteration it increases by $(1+\alpha)$ for some $\alpha &gt; 0$.  (The $\alpha$ can be varied over epochs.) Here $\alpha$ is not too small in our experiments, so as you would imagine, the LR hits astronomical values in no time.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a rate schedule has been successfully used, let alone for highly successful architectures. In fact, as we will see below, the reason we even did this bizarre experiment  was that we already had a mathematical proof that it would work. Specifically, we could show that such ExpLR schedules are at least as powerful as the standard step-decay ones, by which we mean that ExpLR can let us achieve (in function space) all the nets obtainable via the currently popular step-decay schedules.</p>

<h2 id="so-why-does-this-work">So why does this work?</h2>

<p>One key property of state-of-the-art nets we rely on is that they all use some normalization of parameters within layers, usually Batch Norm (BN), which has been shown to give benefits in optimization and generalization across architectures. Our result also holds for other normalizations, including Group Normalization (Wu &amp; He, 2018), Layer Normalization (Ba et al., 2016), Instance Norm (Ulyanov et al., 2016), etc.</p>

<p>The second key property of current training is that they use weight decay (aka $\ell_2$ regularizer). When combined with BN, this implies strange dynamics in parameter space, and the experimental papers (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05350">van Laarhoven, 2017</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01814">Hoffer et al., 2018a</a> and <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1lz-3Rct7">Zhang et al., 2019</a>),  noticed that combining BN and weight decay can  be viewed as increasing the LR.</p>

<p>Our paper gives a rigorous proof of the power of ExpLR by showing the following about the end-to-end function  being computed (see Main Thm in the paper):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Informal Theorem) For commonly  used values of the paremeters, every net produced by <em>Weight Decay + Constant LR + BN + Momentum</em> can also be produced (in function space) via <em>ExpLR + BN + Momentum</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>*NB: If the LR is not fixed but decaying in discrete steps, then the equivalent ExpLR training decays the exponent. (See our paper for details.)</p>

<p>At first sight such a claim may seem difficult (if not impossible) to prove given that we lack any mathematical characterization of nets produced by training (note that the theorem makes no mention of the dataset!).  The  equivalence is shown by reasoning about <em>trajectory</em> of optimization, instead of the usual “landscape view” of stationary points, gradient norms, Hessian norms, smoothness, etc.. This is an example of the importance of trajectory analysis, as argued in <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2019/06/03/trajectories/">earlier blog post of Sanjeev’s</a> because optimization and generalization are deeply intertwined for deep learning. Conventional wisdom says LR controls optimization, and the regularizer controls generalization. Our result shows that the effect of weight decay can  under fairly normal conditions be * exactly*  realized by the ExpLR rate schedule.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
<p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Training PreResNet32 on CIFAR10 with fixed LR $0.1$, momentum $0.9$ and other standard hyperparameters. Trajectory was unchanged when WD was turned off  and LR at iteration $t$ was $\tilde{\eta}_ t = 0.1\times1.481^t$. (The constant $1.481$ is predicted by our theory given the original hyperparameters.) Plot on right shows  weight norm $\pmb{w}$ of the first convolutional layer in the second residual block. It grows exponentially as one would expect, satisfying $|\pmb{w}_ t|_ 2^2/\tilde{\eta}_ t = $ constant.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.offconvex.org/feed.xml# (We first want to clarify that the exponential LR schedules work for normalized networks only and will lead parameter and output explosion for networks without normalization. )">comment</a>:# (In the rest of the post, we will first explain how does this equivalence result arises from various types of normalization schemes and then sketch the proof. We will also present a more general exponential growing learning schedule called ‘'’Tapered Exponential Learning Rate Schedule’, or TEXP, which is both experimentally and theoretically equivalent to the standard Step Decay schedule + Weight Decay. )</p>

<h2 id="scale-invariance-and-equivalence">Scale Invariance and Equivalence</h2>

<p>The formal proof holds for any training loss satisfying 
what we call <em>Scale Invariance</em>:</p>



<p>BN and other normalization schemes result in a Scale-Invariant Loss for the popular deep architectures (Convnet, Resnet, DenseNet etc.) if the output layer –where normally no normalization is used– is fixed throughout training. Empirically, <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Dh8Tg0-">Hoffer et al. (2018b)</a>  found that randomly fixing the output layer at the start does not harm the final accuracy. 
(Appendix C of our paper demonstrates scale invariance for  various architectures; it is somewhat nontrivial.)</p>

<p>For batch ${\mathcal{B}} = \{ x_ i \} _ {i=1}^B$, network parameter ${\pmb{\theta}}$, we  denote the network by $f_ {\pmb{\theta}}$ and the loss function at iteration $t$ by $L_ t(f_ {\pmb{\theta}}) = L(f_ {\pmb{\theta}}, {\mathcal{B}}_ t)$ . We also use $L_ t({\pmb{\theta}})$ for convenience. We say the network $f_ {\pmb{\theta}}$ is <em>scale invariant</em> if $\forall c&gt;0$, $f_ {c{\pmb{\theta}}} = f_ {\pmb{\theta}}$, which implies the loss $L_ t$ is also scale invariant, i.e., $L_  t(c{\pmb{\theta}}_ t)=L_ t({\pmb{\theta}}_ t)$, $\forall c&gt;0$. A key source of intuition is the following lemma provable via chain rule:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Lemma 1</strong>. A scale-invariant loss $L$ satisfies
(1). $\langle\nabla_ {\pmb{\theta}} L, {\pmb{\theta}} \rangle=0$ ;<br />
(2). $\left.\nabla_ {\pmb{\theta}} L \right|_ {\pmb{\theta} = \pmb{\theta}_ 0} = c \left.\nabla_ {\pmb{\theta}} L\right|_  {\pmb{\theta} = c\pmb{\theta}_ 0}$, for any $c&gt;0$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first property immediately implies that $|{\pmb{\theta}}_ t|$ is monotone increasing for SGD if WD is turned off by Pythagoren Theorem. And based on this, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.03981.pdf">our previous work</a> with Kaifeng Lyu shows that GD with any fixed learning rate can reach $\varepsilon$ approximate stationary point for scale invariant objectives in $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$ iterations.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/inv_lemma.png" style="width: 360px;" />
<br />
<b>Figure 3.</b> Illustration of Lemma 1. 
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Below is the main result of the paper. We will explain the proof idea (using scale-invariance) in a later post.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 1(Main, Informal).</strong> SGD on a scale-invariant objective with initial learning rate $\eta$, weight decay factor $\lambda$, and momentum factor $\gamma$ is equivalent to SGD with momentum factor $\gamma$ where at iteration $t$, the ExpLR $\tilde{\eta}_ t$  is defined as $\tilde{\eta}_ t = \alpha^{-2t-1} \eta$ without weight decay($\tilde{\lambda} = 0$) where $\alpha$ is a non-zero root of equation 
     </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Specifically, when momentum $\gamma=0$,  the above schedule can be simplified as $\tilde{\eta}_ t = (1-\lambda\eta)^{-2t-1} \eta$.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="sota-performance-with-exponential-lr">SOTA performance with exponential LR</h3>

<p>As mentioned, reaching state-of-the-art accuracy  requires reducing the learning rate a few times. Suppose the training has $K$ phases, and the learning rate is divided by some constant $C_I&gt;1$ when entering phase $I$. To realize the same effect with an exponentially increasing LR, we have:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 2:</strong> ExpLR with the below modification generates the same network sequence as Step Decay with momentum factor $\gamma$ and WD $\lambda$ does. We call it <em>Tapered Exponential LR schedule</em> (TEXP).<br />
<strong>Modification when entering a new phase $I$</strong>: (1). switching to some smaller exponential growing rate; (2). divinding the current LR by $C_I$.</p>
</blockquote>

<img src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/TEXP.png" style="width: 500px;" />
</div>
<p><strong>Figure 5.</strong> PreResNet32 trained with Step Decay (as in Figure 1) and its corresponding TEXP schedule. As predicted by Theorem 2, they have similar trajectories and performances.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>We hope that this bit of theory and supporting experiments have changed your outlook on learning rates for deep learning.</p>

<p>A follow-up post will present the proof idea and give more insight into why ExpLR suggests a rethinking of the “landscape view” of optimization in deep learning.</p></div>

<p>As if we didn’t have enough to worry us, this week brought the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/googles-head-quantum-computing-hardware-resigns/">sad news</a> that John Martinis, who for five years was the leader and public face of Google’s experimental quantum computing effort, has quit Google and returned to his earlier post at UC Santa Barbara.  I’ve spoken about what happened both with John and with Hartmut Neven, the head of Google’s Quantum AI Lab.  Without betraying confidences, or asserting anything that either side would disagree with, I think I can say that it came down to a difference in management philosophies.  Google tends to be consensus-driven, whereas John is of the view that building a million-qubit, error-corrected quantum computer will take more decisive leadership.  I can add: I’d often wondered how John had time to travel the world, giving talks about quantum supremacy, while also managing the lab’s decisions on a day-to-day basis.  It looks now like I was right to wonder!  Potential analogies flood the mind: is this like a rock band that breaks up right after its breakout hit?  Is it like Steve Jobs leaving Apple?  Anyway, I wish the Google team the best in John’s absence, and I also wish John the best with whatever he does next.</p>



<p>I was never big on HBO (e.g., I still haven’t seen a single minute of <em>Game of Thrones</em>), but in the last couple of weeks, Dana and I found ourselves watching two absolutely compelling HBO shows—one a fictional miniseries and the other a documentary, but both on the theme of the fragility of American democracy.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.hbo.com/the-plot-against-america"><em>The Plot Against America</em></a>, based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plot_Against_America">2004 Philip Roth novel</a> of the same name (which Dana read and which I now plan to read), is about an alternate history where the aviator Charles Lindbergh defeats FDR in the 1940 presidential election, on a fascist and isolationist platform, in events that—as countless people have pointed out—are eerily, terrifyingly prescient of what would actualy befall the US in 2016.  The series follows a Jewish insurance salesman and his family in Newark, NJ—isn’t that what it always is with Philip Roth?—as they try to cope with the country’s gradual, all-too-plausible slide downward, from the genteel antisemitism that already existed in <em>our</em> timeline’s 1940 all the way to riots, assassinations, and pogroms (although never to an American Holocaust).  One of the series’ final images is of paper ballots, in a rematch presidential election, being carted away and burned, underscoring just how much depends here on the mundane machinery of democracy.</p>



<p>Which brings me to <a href="https://www.hbo.com/documentaries/kill-chain-the-cyber-war-on-americas-elections"><em>Kill Chain: The Cyber War on America’s Elections</em></a>, a documentary about the jaw-droppingly hackable electronic voting machines used in US elections and the fight to do something about them.  The show mostly follows the journey of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harri_Hursti">Harri Hursti</a>, a Finnish-born programmer who’s made this issue his life’s work, but it also extensively features my childhood best friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Halderman">Alex Halderman</a>.  OK, but isn’t this a theoretical issue, one that (perhaps rightly) exercises security nerds like Alex, but surely hasn’t changed the outcomes of actual elections?</p>



<p>Yeah, so about that.  You know Brian Kemp, the doofus governor of Georgia, who’s infamously announced plans to reopen the state right away, ignoring the pleading of public health experts—a  act that will fill Georgia’s ICUs and morgues as surely as night follows day?  And you know how Kemp defeated the Democrat, Stacey Abrams, by a razor-thin margin, in a 2018 election of which Kemp himself was the overseer?  It turns out that Kemp’s office distributed defective memory cards to African-American and Democratic precincts, though not to white and Republican ones.  There’s also striking statistical evidence that at least some voting machines were hacked, although because there was no paper trail it can never be proved.</p>



<p>In short, what <em>The Plot Against America</em> and <em>Kill Chain</em> have in common is that they <em>would be</em> desperately needed warnings about the ease with which democracy could collapse in the US, except for the detail that much of what they warn about has already happened, and now it’s not clear how we get back.</p></div>

Adaptive sampling repeatedly selects rows of an underlying <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="d" class="latex" title="d" /> matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="A" class="latex" title="A" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cgg+d&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="n \gg d" class="latex" title="n \gg d" />, with probabilities proportional to their distances to the subspace of the previously selected rows. Intuitively, adaptive sampling seems to be limited to trivial multi-pass algorithms in the streaming model of computation due to its inherently sequential nature of assigning sampling probabilities to each row only after the previous iteration is completed. Surprisingly, we show this is not the case by giving the first one-pass algorithms for adaptive sampling on turnstile streams and using space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7Bpoly%7D%28d%2Ck%2C%5Clog+n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="\text{poly}(d,k,\log n)" class="latex" title="\text{poly}(d,k,\log n)" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" /> is the number of adaptive sampling rounds to be performed.</p>
<p>Our adaptive sampling procedure has a number of applications to various data summarization problems on turnstile streams that either improve state-of-the-art or have only been previously studied in the more relaxed row-arrival model. This includes column subset selection, subspace approximation, projective clustering, and volume maximization. We complement our volume maximization algorithmic results with lower bounds that are tight up to lower order terms, even for multi-pass algorithms. By a similar construction, we also obtain lower bounds for volume maximization in the row-arrival model, which we match with competitive upper bounds.</p>
<p>This is a joint work with Ilya Razenshteyn, David Woodruff, and Samson Zhou.</p></blockquote></div>

In this work we study bounded collusion protocols (BCPs) recently introduced in the context of secret sharing by Kumar, Meka, and Sahai (FOCS 2019). These are multi-party communication protocols on $n$ parties where in each round a subset of $p$-parties (the collusion bound) collude together and write a function of their inputs on a public blackboard. 

BCPs interpolate elegantly between the well-studied number-in-hand (NIH) model ($p=1$) and the number-on-forehead (NOF) model ($p=n-1$). Motivated by questions in communication complexity, secret sharing, and pseudorandomness we investigate BCPs more thoroughly answering several questions about them. 

* We prove a polynomial (in the input-length) lower bound for an explicit function against BCPs where any constant fraction of players can collude. Previously, non-trivial lower bounds were only known when the collusion bound was at most logarithmic in the input-length (owing to bottlenecks in NOF lower bounds). 

* For all $t \leq n$, we construct efficient $t$-out-of-$n$ secret sharing schemes where the secret remains hidden even given the transcript of a BCP with collusion bound $O(t/\log t)$. Prior work could only handle collusions of size $O(\log n)$. Along the way, we construct leakage-resilient schemes against disjoint and adaptive leakage,  resolving a question asked by Goyal and Kumar (STOC 2018).

* An explicit $n$-source cylinder intersection extractor whose output is close to uniform even when given the transcript of a BCP with a constant fraction of parties colluding. The min-entropy rate we require is $0.3$ (independent of collusion bound $p \ll n$). 

Our results rely on a new class of exponential sums that interpolate between the ones considered in additive combinatorics by Bourgain (Geometric and Functional Analysis 2009) and Petridis and Shparlinski (Journal d'Analyse Mathématique 2019).</div>

Starting with the two standard model of randomized communication complexity, we study the communication complexity of functions when the protocol has access to a defective source of randomness. 
Specifically, we consider both the public-randomness and private-randomness cases, while replacing the commonly postulated perfect randomness with distributions over $\ell$ bit strings that have min-entropy at least $k\leq\ell$. 
We present general upper and lower bounds on the communication complexity in these cases, where the bounds are typically linear in $\ell-k$ and also depend on the size of the fooling set for the function being computed and on its standard randomized complexity.</div>

<p><i>(This blog post is based on joint work with </i><a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~dkogan/"><i>Dima Kogan</i></a><i>.)</i></p>
<p>One of the great unsung perks of being a college student is having access to the university library. There is something thrilling about hunting down exactly the right reference deep in the stacks, or reading through the archived papers of a public figure from years back.</p>
<p>The pandemic has closed all of our libraries for the time being. Even so, through the fruits of computer science—databases, the Internet, e-readers, and so on—we can get access to much of the same information even when we are cooped up at home.</p>
<p>But for me, one of the true pleasures of using a library is the fact that I can browse through any book I want in complete privacy. If I want to go up to the stacks and read about tulip gardening, or road-bike maintenance, or strategies for managing anxiety, I can do that pretty much without anyone else knowing.</p>
<p>In contrast, if I go online today and search for “tulip gardening,” Google will take careful note of my interest in tulips and I will be seeing ads about gardening tools for months.</p>
<p>An ideal digital library would let us download and read books without anyone—not even the library itself—learning which books we are reading. How could we build such a privacy-respecting digital library?</p>
<p>In this post, we will discuss the private-library problem and how <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1075">our recent work on private information retrieval</a> might be able to help solve it.</p>
<h3><b>The Private-Library Problem</b></h3>
<p>Let us define the problem a little more precisely. We will imagine a protocol running between a library, which holds the books, and a student, who wants to download a particular book.</p>
<p>Say that the library has <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="N" class="latex" title="N" /> books—let’s call the books <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%28x_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x=(x_1, \dots, x_N)" class="latex" title="x=(x_1, \dots, x_N)" />. To keep things simple, let’s pretend that each book consists of just a single bit of information, so <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i+%5Cin+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x_i \in \{0,1\}" class="latex" title="x_i \in \{0,1\}" /> for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cin+%5C%7B1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}" class="latex" title="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}" />.</p>
<p>The student starts out holding the index <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cin+%5C%7B1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}" class="latex" title="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}" /> of her desired book. To fetch the digital book from the library, the student and library exchange some messages. At the end of the interaction, we want the following two properties to hold:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Correctness.</b> The student should have her desired book (i.e., the bit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x_i" class="latex" title="x_i" />).</li>
<li><b>Privacy. </b>The library should have not learned any information, in a cryptographic sense, about which book the student downloaded.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, we have grossly simplified the problem: a real book is more than a single bit in length, book titles are not consecutive integers, maybe the student would like to find a book using a keyword search, etc. But even this simplified private-information-retrieval problem, which <a href="http://www.tau.ac.il/~bchor/PIR.pdf">Chor, Goldreich, Kushilevitz, and Sudan introduced</a> in the 90s, is already interesting enough.</p>
<h3><b>A simple but inefficient solution</b></h3>
<p>There is a simple solution to this problem: the student can just ask the library to send her the contents of all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="N" class="latex" title="N" /> books. This solution achieves both correctness and privacy, so what’s the problem? Are we done?</p>
<p>Well, there are two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>The amount of <b>communication</b> is large: Just to read a single book, the client must download the contents of the entire library! So this is terribly inefficient.</li>
<li>The amount of <b>computation</b> is large: Just to fetch a single book, the library must do work proportional to the size of the entire library. So “checking out” a book from this digital library will take a long time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Research on private information retrieval typically focuses on the first problem: how can we reduce the <i>communication</i> cost? Using a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2968443">variety</a> of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/646125">clever</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2976749.2978429">techniques</a>, it is possible to drive down the communication cost to something very small—sub-polynomial or even logarithmic in the library size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="N" class="latex" title="N" />.</p>
<p>But today we are interested in the <i>computational</i> burden on the library. Is there any way that the student can privately download a book from the library while requiring the library to do only <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%28N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="o(N)" class="latex" title="o(N)" /> work in the process?</p>
<h3><b>Doing the hard work in advance</b></h3>
<p>To have both correctness and privacy, it seems that the library needs to touch each of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="N" class="latex" title="N" /> books in the process of responding to each student’s request. And, in some sense, <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cis/pubs/malkin/BIM.ps">this is true</a>. So, to allow the library to run in time sublinear in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="N" class="latex" title="N" />, we will have to tweak the problem slightly.</p>
<p>Our idea is to have the library do the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="O(N)" class="latex" title="O(N)" />-time computation in an <b>offline phase</b>, which takes place <i>before</i> the student decides which book she wants to read. For example, this offline phase might happen overnight while the library’s servers would otherwise be idle.</p>
<p>Later on, once the student decides which book in the library she wants to read, the student and library can run a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%28N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="o(N)" class="latex" title="o(N)" />-time <b>online phase</b> in which the student is able to retrieve her desired book. The total communication cost, in both offline and online phases, will be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%28N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="o(N)" class="latex" title="o(N)" />.</p>
<p>So, by pushing the library’s expensive linear scan to an offline phase, the library can service the student’s request for a book in sublinear online time.</p>
<h3><b>Our offline/online private information retrieval scheme</b></h3>
<p>Let’s see how to construct such an offline/online scheme. To make things simple for the purposes of this post, let’s assume that the student has access to two non-colluding libraries that hold the same set of books. To be concrete, let’s call the two libraries “Stanford” and “Berkeley.”</p>
<p>The privacy property will hold as long as the librarians at Stanford and Berkeley don’t get together and share the information that they learned while running the protocol with the student. So Stanford and Berkeley here are “non-colluding.” (Equivalently, our scheme that protects privacy against an adversary that controls one of the two libraries—but not both.)</p>
<div style="width: 571px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1670"><img width="561" alt="Offline-online PIR" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/offlineonline.png?w=561&amp;h=365" class=" wp-image-1670" height="365" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1670">In the offline phase, which happens before the student knows which book she wants to read, the Stanford library does linear work. In the online phase, which runs once the student has the index of her desired book, the Berkeley library runs in sublinear time. (We are suppressing log factors here.)</p></div>
<p>Now, let’s describe an offline/online protocol by which the student can privately fetch a book from the digital library:</p>
<p><b>Offline Phase.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The student partitions the integers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B1%2C+..%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\{1, .., N\}" class="latex" title="\{1, .., N\}" /> into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\sqrt{N}" class="latex" title="\sqrt{N}" /> non-overlapping sets chosen at random, where each set has size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\sqrt{N}" class="latex" title="\sqrt{N}" />. Call these sets <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+S_%7B%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S_1, \dots, S_{\sqrt{N}}" class="latex" title="S_1, \dots, S_{\sqrt{N}}" />.</li>
<li>The student sends these sets <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+S_%7B%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S_1, \dots, S_{\sqrt{N}}" class="latex" title="S_1, \dots, S_{\sqrt{N}}" /> to Stanford (the first library). To reduce the communication cost here, the student can compress these sets using pseudorandomness.</li>
<li>For each set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S_j" class="latex" title="S_j" />, the Stanford library computes the <i>parity</i> of all of the books indexed by set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S_j" class="latex" title="S_j" /> and returns the parity bits <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28b_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+b_%7B%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="(b_1, \dots, b_{\sqrt{N}})" class="latex" title="(b_1, \dots, b_{\sqrt{N}})" /> to the student. In other words, if the books are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%28x_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_N%29+%5Cin+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x=(x_1, \dots, x_N) \in \{0,1\}^n" class="latex" title="x=(x_1, \dots, x_N) \in \{0,1\}^n" />, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_j+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bk+%5Cin+S_j%7D+x_k+%5Cbmod+2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="b_j = \sum_{k \in S_j} x_k \bmod 2" class="latex" title="b_j = \sum_{k \in S_j} x_k \bmod 2" />.</li>
</ul>
<p>The total communication in this phase is only <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="O(\sqrt{N})" class="latex" title="O(\sqrt{N})" /> bits and the student and the Stanford library can run this step <i>before</i> the student decides which book she wants to read.</p>
<p><b>Online Phase.</b> Once the student decides that she wants to read book <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cin+%5C%7B1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}" class="latex" title="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}" />, the student and Berkeley (the second library) run the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>The student finds the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S_j" class="latex" title="S_j" /> that contains the index <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" /> of her desired book.</li>
<li>The student flips a coin that is weighted to come up heads with some probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="p" class="latex" title="p" />, to be fixed later.</li>
<li>If the coin lands <span style="text-decoration: underline;">heads</span>:
<ul>
<li>The student sends <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%5Cgets+S_j+%5Csetminus+%5C%7Bi%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S \gets S_j \setminus \{i\}" class="latex" title="S \gets S_j \setminus \{i\}" /> to the Berkeley library.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the coin lands <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tails</span>:
<ul>
<li>The student samples <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%27+%5Cgets_R+S_j+%5Csetminus+%5C%7Bi%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i' \gets_R S_j \setminus \{i\}" class="latex" title="i' \gets_R S_j \setminus \{i\}" />.</li>
<li>The student sends <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%5Cgets+S_j+%5Csetminus+%5C%7Bi%27%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S \gets S_j \setminus \{i'\}" class="latex" title="S \gets S_j \setminus \{i'\}" /> to the Berkeley library.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Berkeley library receives the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%5Csubseteq+%5C%7B1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S \subseteq \{1, \dots, N\}" class="latex" title="S \subseteq \{1, \dots, N\}" /> from the student. The Berkeley library returns the contents of all books whose indices appear in set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> to the student.</li>
<li>Now, the student can recover its desired book as follows:
<ul>
<li>If <span style="text-decoration: underline;">heads</span>: the student now has the parity of the books in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S_j" class="latex" title="S_j" /> (from the offline phase) and the value of all books in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S_j" class="latex" title="S_j" /> that are not book <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" />. This is enough to recover the contents of book <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" />.</li>
<li>If <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tails</span>: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cin+S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i \in S" class="latex" title="i \in S" />. In this case the Berkeley library has sent the contents of book <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" /> to the student in the online phase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even before we fix the weight <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="p" class="latex" title="p" /> of the coin, we see that the protocol satisfies <b>correctness</b>, since no matter how the coin lands the client recovers its desired book. Also, the total communication cost is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BN%7D+%5Clog+N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="O(\sqrt{N} \log N)" class="latex" title="O(\sqrt{N} \log N)" /> bits, which is sublinear as we had hoped. Finally, the <b>online computation cost</b> is also sublinear: the Berkeley library just needs to return <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\sqrt{N}" class="latex" title="\sqrt{N}" /> books to the client, which it can do in time roughly <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="O(\sqrt{N})" class="latex" title="O(\sqrt{N})" />.</p>
<p>The last matter to address is <b>privacy</b>. Again, we are assuming that the adversary controls only one of the two libraries.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the offline phase, the student’s message to the Stanford library is independent of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" />, so the protocol is perfectly private with respect to Stanford.</li>
<li>In the online phase, we must be more careful. It turns out that if we choose the weight <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="p" class="latex" title="p" /> of the coin as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3D+1+-+%28%5Csqrt%7BN%7D+-+1%29%2FN&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="p = 1 - (\sqrt{N} - 1)/N" class="latex" title="p = 1 - (\sqrt{N} - 1)/N" />, then the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> that the student sends to UC Berkeley in the online phase is just a uniformly random size-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Csqrt%7BN%7D-1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="(\sqrt{N}-1)" class="latex" title="(\sqrt{N}-1)" /> subset of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\{1, \dots, N\}" class="latex" title="\{1, \dots, N\}" />.</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Open problems</b></h3>
<p>So, the student can privately fetch a book from our digital libraries in sublinear online time. What else is left to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting rid of the need for two non-colluding libraries is a clear next step. <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1075">Our work</a> has some results along these lines, but they pay a price either in (a) asymptotic efficiency or in (b) the strength of the cryptographic assumptions required.</li>
<li>A beautiful paper of <a href="https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~beimel/Papers/BIM.pdf">Beimel, Ishai, and Malkin</a> shows that if the library can store its collection of books using a special type of error-correcting encoding, the <b>total</b> computational time at the libraries (not just the online time) can be sublinear in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="N" class="latex" title="N" />. As far as we know, these schemes are not concretely efficient enough to use in practice. Could they be made so?</li>
<li>Privacy is just one of the many pleasures of using a physical library. During this period of confinement, I also miss the smell of the books, the beauty of light filtering through the stacks, and the peacefulness of thinking in a study carrel. Can a digital library ever give us these things too?</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these questions catch your fancy, please check out <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1075">our Eurocrypt paper</a> for more background, pointers, and results.</p>
<p>Don Knuth <a href="http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf">has reportedly said</a> “Using a great library to solve a specific problem… Now <i>that</i> […] is real living.” With better digital libraries, maybe we could all live a little bit more during these challenging days.</p></div>

<p>As many of you have probably anticipated, due to concerns regarding the novel coronavirus COVID-19, the <a href="http://ec20.sigecom.org/">2020 ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC 2020)</a> will be held virtually.</p>
<p>This change of format will of course present us with difficult challenges, but we believe it will offer exciting new opportunities as well.  (And not to worry, your opportunity to attend EC in Budapest is just deferred to 2021.)</p>
<p>The <a href="http://sigecom.org/officers.html">SIGecom Executive Committee</a> has appointed and will serve on a Virtual Transition Team that additionally includes the following new conference officers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual General Chair: <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartline/">Jason Hartline</a></li>
<li>Virtual Local Chair: <a href="https://yannai.gonch.name/">Yannai Gonczarowski</a></li>
<li>Virtual Global Outreach Chairs: <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~red/">Rediet Abebe</a> and <a href="https://research.fb.com/people/sodomka-eric/">Eric Sodomka</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This team is working with the <a href="http://ec20.sigecom.org/committees-acm/organizing-committee/">EC 2020 organizing committee</a> and <a href="http://ec20.sigecom.org/committees-acm/program-committee/">EC 2020 PC chairs</a> to put together a plan that leverages the opportunities of the virtual format to the fullest extent. Though these plans are still in the works, we have identified the following “minimal commitment” for authors of accepted papers to the main EC conference: at least one author will need to</p>
<ul>
<li>register for the conference;</li>
<li>be available virtually on the conference dates (July 14-16);</li>
<li>provide a camera-ready paper or abstract by the camera-ready deadline;</li>
<li>provide a pre-recorded talk presenting the paper two weeks in advance (by June 28).</li>
</ul>
<p>We are optimistic that, while a virtual EC may lack some of the positive features of a classical conference, the format will also provide opportunities that improve on the classical experience.  As with any conference there will be opportunities to participate beyond the “minimal commitment.”  We hope that speakers and participants will join in other activities, which may include preview sessions for talks before the conference proper, watch parties for speakers and attendees, and mechanisms for reaching a wider audience with the technical program. With many academic interactions moving virtual, the barriers to collaboration with distant colleagues have lowered, and we hope that EC 2020 will kindle and rekindle global collaborations.</p>
<div>
<p>Further details about these activities as well as the minimal requirements will be circulated by June 1.</p>
<p>Tutorial speakers and workshop organizers will receive separate emails from the Tutorial and Workshop Chairs about plans for moving these events online.</p>

<p>The second part of our brief survey of differentially private statistics. This time, we show how to privately estimate the CDF of a distribution (i.e., estimate the distribution in Kolmogorov distance), and conclude with pointers to some other work in the space.</p>
<p>The first part of this series is <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/2020/04/14/a-primer-on-private-statistics-part-i/">here</a>, and you can download both parts in PDF form <a href="http://www.gautamkamath.com/writings/primer.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>1. CDF Estimation for Discrete, Univariate Distributions </b></p>
<p>Suppose we have a distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> over the ordered, discrete domain <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B1%2C%5Cdots%2CD%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\{1,\dots,D\}}" class="latex" title="{\{1,\dots,D\}}" /> and let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathcal{P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathcal{P}}" /> be the family of all such distributions. The CDF of the distribution is the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi_%7BP%7D+%3A+%5C%7B1%2C%5Cdots%2CD%5C%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5B0%2C1%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\Phi_{P} : \{1,\dots,D\} \rightarrow [0,1]}" class="latex" title="{\Phi_{P} : \{1,\dots,D\} \rightarrow [0,1]}" /> given by</p>

<p>A natural measure of distance between CDFs is the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell_%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\ell_\infty}" class="latex" title="{\ell_\infty}" /> distance, as this is the sort of convergence guarantee that the empirical CDF satisfies. That is, in the non-private setting, the empirical CDF will achieve the minimax rate, which it known by [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DKW56">DKW56</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#Mas90">Mas90</a>] to be <a name="eqdkw"></a></p>

<p><b> 1.2. Why Restrict the Domain? </b></p>
<p>A drawback of the estimator we constructed is that it only applies to distributions of finite support <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B1%2C2%2C%5Cdots%2CD%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\{1,2,\dots,D\}}" class="latex" title="{\{1,2,\dots,D\}}" />, albeit with a relatively mild dependence on the support size. If privacy isn’t a concern, then no such restriction is necessary, as the bound <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#eqdkw">(2)</a> applies equally well to any distribution over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathbb+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{{\mathbb R}}" class="latex" title="{{\mathbb R}}" />. Can we construct a differentially private estimator for distributions with infinite support?</p>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly, the answer to this question is no! Any differentially private estimator for the CDF of the distribution has to have a rate that depends on the support size, and cannot give non-trivial rates for distributions with infinite support.</p>

<p>The notation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog%5E%2A+D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\log^* D}" class="latex" title="{\log^* D}" /> refers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_logarithm">iterated logarithm</a>.</p>
<p>We emphasize that this theorem shouldn’t meet with too much alarm, as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog%5E%2A+D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\log^* D}" class="latex" title="{\log^* D}" /> grows remarkably slowly with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{D}" class="latex" title="{D}" />. There are differentially private CDF estimators that achieve very mild dependence on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{D}" class="latex" title="{D}" /> [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BNS13">BNS13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BNSV15">BNSV15</a>], including one nearly matching the lower bound in Theorem <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#thmcdf-lb">2</a>. Moreover, if we want to estimate a distribution over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathbb+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{{\mathbb R}}" class="latex" title="{{\mathbb R}}" />, and are willing to make some mild regularity conditions on the distribution, then we can approximate it by a distribution with finite support and only increase the rate slightly. However, what Theorem <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#thmcdf-lb">2</a> shows is that there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution to private CDF estimation that achieves similar guarantees to the empirical CDF. That is, the right algorithm has to be tailored somewhat to the application and the assumptions we can make about the distribution.</p>
<p><b>2. More Private Statistics </b></p>
<p>Of course, the story doesn’t end here! There’s a whole wide world of differentially private statistics beyond what we’ve mentioned already. We proceed to survey just a few other directions of study in private statistics.</p>
<p><b> 2.1. Parameter and Distribution Estimation </b></p>

Tight lower bounds for this problem follow from the tracing attacks introduced in [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BUV14">BUV14</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DSSUV15">DSSUV15</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BSU17">BSU17</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU17a">SU17a</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU17b">SU17b</a>]. A very recent work of Acharya, Sun, and Zhang [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ASZ20">ASZ20</a>] adapts classical tools for proving estimation and testing lower bounds (lemmata of Assouad, Fano, and Le Cam) to the differentially private setting. Steinke and Ullman [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU17b">SU17b</a>] give tight minimax lower bounds for the weaker guarantee of selecting the largest coordinates of the mean, which were refined by Cai, Wang, and Zhang [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CWZ19">CWZ19</a>] to give lower bounds for sparse mean-estimation problems.</p>
<p>Nissim, Raskhodnikova, and Smith introduced the highly general sample-and-aggregate paradigm, which they apply to several learning problems (e.g., learning mixtures of Gaussians) [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#NRS07">NRS07</a>]. Later, Smith [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#Smi11">Smi11</a>] showed that this paradigm can be used to transform any estimator for any asymptotically normal, univariate statistic over a bounded data domain into a differentially private one with the same asymptotic convergence rate.</p>
<p>Subsequent work has focused on both relaxing the assumptions in [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#Smi11">Smi11</a>], particularly boundedness, and on giving finite-sample guarantees. Karwa and Vadhan investigated the problem of Gaussian mean estimation, proving the first near-optimal bounds for this setting [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KV18">KV18</a>]. In particular, exploiting concentration properties of Gaussian data allows us to achieve non-trivial results even with unbounded data, which is impossible in general. Following this, Kamath, Li, Singhal, and Ullman moved to the multivariate setting, investigating the estimation of Gaussians and binary product distributions in total variation distance [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KLSU19">KLSU19</a>]. In certain cases (i.e., Gaussians with identity covariance), this is equivalent to mean estimation in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\ell_2}" class="latex" title="{\ell_2}" />-distance, though not always. For example, for binary product distribution, one must estimate the mean in a type of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cchi%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\chi^2}" class="latex" title="{\chi^2}" />-distance instead. The perspective of distribution estimation rather than parameter estimation can be valuable. Bun, Kamath, Steinke, and Wu [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BKSW19">BKSW19</a>] develop a primitive for private hypothesis selection, which they apply to learn any coverable class of distributions under pure differential privacy. Through the lens of distribution estimation, their work implies an upper bound for mean estimation of binary product distributions that bypasses lower bounds for the same problem in the empirical setting. In addition to work on mean estimation in the sub-Gaussian setting, such as the results discussed earlier, mean estimation has also been studied under weaker moment conditions [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BS19">BS19</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KSU20">KSU20</a>]. Beyond these settings, there has also been study of estimation of discrete multinomials, including estimation in Kolmogorov distance [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BNSV15">BNSV15</a>] and in total variation distance for structured distributions [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DHS15">DHS15</a>], and parameter estimation of Markov Random Fields [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ZKKW20">ZKKW20</a>].</p>
<p>A different approach to constructing differentially private estimators is based on robust statistics. This approah begins with the influential work of Dwork and Lei [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DL09">DL09</a>], which introduced the propose-test-release framework, and applied to estimating robust statistics such as the median and interquartile range. While the definitions in robust statistics and differential privacy are semantically similar, formal connections between the two remain relatively scant, which suggests a productive area for future study.</p>
<p><b> 2.2. Hypothesis Testing </b></p>
<p>An influential work of Homer et al. [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#HSRDTMPSNC08">HSRDTMPSNC08</a>] demonstrated the vulnerability of classical statistics in a genomic setting, showing that certain <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cchi%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\chi^2}" class="latex" title="{\chi^2}" />-statistics on many different variables could allow an attacker to determine the presence of an individual in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Motivated by these concerns, an early line of work from the statistics community focused on addressing these issues [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#VS09">VS09</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#USF13">USF13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#YFSU14">YFSU14</a>].</p>
<p>More recently, work on private hypothesis testing can be divided roughly into two lines. The first focuses on the minimax sample complexity, in a line initiated by Cai, Daskalakis, and Kamath [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CDK17">CDK17</a>], who give an algorithm for privately testing goodness-of-fit (more precisely, a statistician might refer to this problem as one-sample testing of multinomial data). A number of subsequent works have essentially settled the complexity of this problem [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ASZ18">ASZ18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ADR18">ADR18</a>], giving tight upper and lower bounds. Other papers in this line study related problems, including the two-sample version of the problem, independence testing, and goodness-of-fit testing for multivariate product distributions [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ASZ18">ASZ18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ADR18">ADR18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ADKR19">ADKR19</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMUZ19">CKMUZ19</a>]. A related paper studies the minimax sample complexity of property <em>estimation</em>, rather than testing of discrete distributions, including support size and entropy [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#AKSZ18">AKSZ18</a>]. Other recent works in this vein focus on testing of simple hypotheses [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMTZ18">CKMTZ18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMSU19">CKMSU19</a>]. In particular [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMSU19">CKMSU19</a>] proves an analogue of the Neyman-Pearson Lemma for differentially private testing of simple hypotheses. A paper of Awan and Slavkovic [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#AS18">AS18</a>] gives a universally optimal test when the domain size is two, however Brenner and Nissim [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BN14">BN14</a>] shows that such universally optimal tests cannot exist when the domain has more than two elements. A related problem in this space is private change-point detection [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMTZ18">CKMTZ18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMSU19">CKMSU19</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKLZ19">CKLZ19</a>] — in this setting, we are given a time series of datapoints which are sampled from a distribution, which at some point, changes to a different distribution. The goal is to (privately) determine when this point occurs.</p>
<p>Complementary to minimax hypothesis testing, a line of work [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#WLK15">WLK15</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#GLRV16">GLRV16</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KR17">KR17</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KSF17">KSF17</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CBRG18">CBRG18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SGGRGB19">SGGRGB19</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKSBG19">CKSBG19</a>] designs differentially private versions of popular test statistics for testing goodness-of-fit, closeness, and independence, as well as private ANOVA, focusing on the performance at small sample sizes. Work by Wang et al. [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#WKLK18">WKLK18</a>] focuses on generating statistical approximating distributions for differentially private statistics, which they apply to hypothesis testing problems.</p>
<p><b> 2.3. Differential Privacy on Graphs </b></p>
<p>There is a significant amount of work on differentially private analysis of graphs. We remark that these algorithms can satisfy either edge or node differential privacy. The former (easier) guarantee defines a neighboring graph to be one obtained by adding or removing a single edge, while in the latter (harder) setting, a neighboring graph is one that can be obtained by modifying the set of edges connected to a single node. The main challenge in this area is that most graph statistics can have high sensitivity in the worst-case.</p>
<p>The initial works in this area focused on the empirical setting, and goals range from counting subgraphs [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KRSY11">KRSY11</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BBDS13">BBDS13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KNRS13">KNRS13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CZ13">CZ13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#RS16">RS16</a>] to outputting a privatized graph which approximates the original [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#GRU12">GRU12</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BBDS12">BBDS12</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#Upa13">Upa13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#AU19">AU19</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#EKKL20">EKKL20</a>]. In contrast to the setting discussed in most of this series, it seems that there are larger qualitative differences between the study of empirical and population statistics due to the fact that many graph statistics have high worst-case sensitivity, but may have smaller sensitivity on typical graphs from many natural models.</p>
<p>In the population statistics setting, recent work has focused on parameter estimation of the underlying random graph model. So far this work has given estimators for the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\beta}" class="latex" title="{\beta}" />-model [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KS16">KS16</a>] and graphons [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BCS15">BCS15</a>,<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BCSZ18">BCSZ18</a>]. Graphons are a generalization of the stochastic block model, which is, in turn, a generalization of the Erdös-Rényi model. Interestingly, the methods of Lipschitz-extensions introduced in the empirical setting by [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BBDS13">BBDS13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KNRS13">KNRS13</a>] are the main tool used in the statistical setting as well. While the first works on private graphon estimation were not computationally efficient, a recent focus has been on obviating these issues for certain important cases, such as the Erdös-Rényi setting [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU19">SU19</a>].</p>

<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Scott’s foreword:</span></strong> Today I’m honored to host another guest post by friend-of-the-blog Steve Ebin, who not only published a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4675">beautiful essay</a> here a month ago (the one that I titled “First it came from Wuhan”), but also posted an extremely informative <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4695#comment-1834991">timeline</a> of what he understood when about the severity of the covid crisis, from early January until March 31st.  By the latter date, Steve had quit his job, having made a hefty sum shorting airline stocks, and was devoting his full time to a new nonprofit to manufacture low-cost ventilators, called AirToAll.  A couple weeks ago, Steve was kind enough to include me in one of AirToAll’s regular Zoom meetings; I learned more about pistons than I had in my entire previous life (admittedly, still not much).  Which brings me to what Steve wants to talk about today: what he and others are doing and how <em>you</em> can help.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Without further ado, Steve’s guest post:</span></strong></p>



<p>In my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4675">last essay</a> on Coronavirus, I argued that Coronavirus will radically change society.  In this blog post, I’d like to propose a structure for how we can organize to fight the virus.  I will also make a call to action for readers of this blog to help a non-profit I co-founded, <a href="http://airtoall.org">AirToAll</a>, build safe, low-cost ventilators and other medical devices and distribute them across the world at scale.</p>



<p>There are four ways we can help fight coronavirus:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Reduce exposure to the virus. </strong>Examples: learn where the virus is through better testing; attempt to be where the virus isn’t through social distancing, quarantining, and other means.</li><li><strong>Reduce the chance of exposure leading to infection.</strong> Examples: Wash your hands; avoid touching your face; wear personal protective equipment.</li><li><strong>Reduce the chance of infection leading to serious illness. </strong>Examples: improve your aerobic and pulmonary health; make it more difficult for coronavirus’s spike protein to bind to ACE-2 receptors; scale antibody therapies; consume adequate vitamin D; get more sleep; develop a vaccine.</li><li><strong>Reduce the chance of serious illness leading to death. </strong>Examples: ramp up the production and distribution of certain drugs; develop better drugs; build more ventilators; help healthcare workers.</li></ol>



<p>Obviously, not every example I listed is practical, advisable, or will work, and some options, like producing a vaccine, may be better solutions than others. But we must pursue all approaches.</p>



<p>I’ve been devoting my own time to pursuing the fourth approach, reducing the chance that the illness will lead to death.  Specifically, along with Neil Thanedar, I co-founded AirToAll, a nonprofit that helps bring low-cost, reliable, and clinically tested ventilators to market.  I know lots of groups are working on this problem, so I thought I’d talk about it briefly.</p>



<p>First, like many groups, we’re designing our own ventilators.  Although designing ventilators and bringing them to market at scale poses unique challenges, particularly in an environment where supply chains are strained, this is <em>much </em>easier than it must have been to build iron lungs in the early part of the 20th century, when Zoom conferencing wasn’t yet invented.  When it comes to the ventilators we’re producing, we’re focused on safety and clinical validation rather than speed to market.  We are not the farthest along here, but we’ve made good progress.</p>



<p>Second, our nonprofit is helping other groups produce safe and reliable ventilators by doing direct consultations with them and also by producing <a href="https://591654b2-a393-4da6-9d87-f168fb514898.filesusr.com/ugd/9fa1d3_9f8fa025b877468e91b8ba575c054815.pdf">whitepapers</a> to help them think through the issues at hand (h/t to Harvey Hawes, Abdullah Saleh, and our friends at <a href="https://icchange.ca/">ICChange</a>).</p>



<p>Third, we’re working to increase the manufacturing capacity for currently approved ventilators.</p>



<p>The current shortage of ventilators is a symptom of a greater underlying problem: namely, the world is not good at recognizing healthcare crises early and responding to them quickly.  While our nonprofit helps bring more ventilators to market, we are also trying to solve this greater underlying problem.  I look at our work in ventilator-land as a first step towards our ultimate goal of making medical devices cheaper and more available through an open-source nonprofit model.</p>



<p>I am writing this post as a call to action to you, dear <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> reader, to get involved.</p>



<p>You don’t have to be an engineer, pulmonologist, virologist, or epidemiologist to help us, although those skillsets are of course helpful and if you are we’d love to have you.  If you have experience in data science and modeling, supply chain and manufacturing, public health, finance, operations, community management, or anything else a rapidly scaling organization needs, you can help us too. </p>



<p>We are a group of 700+ volunteers and growing rapidly.  If you’d like to help, we’d love to have you.  If you might be interested in volunteering, click <a href="https://airtoall.org/community/">here</a>.  Donors click <a href="https://airtoall.org/donate/">here</a>.  Everyone else, please email me at <a href="mailto:steven@airtoall.org">steven@airtoall.org</a> and include a clear subject line so I can direct you to the right person.</p></div>

QBF solvers implementing the QCDCL paradigm are powerful algorithms that
successfully tackle many computationally complex applications. However, our
theoretical understanding of the strength and limitations of these QCDCL
solvers is very limited.

In this paper we suggest to formally model QCDCL solvers as proof systems. We
define different policies that can be used for decision heuristics and unit
propagation and give rise to a number of sound and complete QBF proof systems
(and hence new QCDCL algorithms). With respect to the standard policies used
in practical QCDCL solving, we show that the corresponding QCDCL proof system
is incomparable (via exponential separations) to Q-resolution, the classical
QBF resolution system used in the literature. This is in stark contrast to the
propositional setting where CDCL and resolution are known to be p-equivalent.

This raises the question what formulas are hard for standard QCDCL, since
Q-resolution lower bounds do not necessarily apply to QCDCL as we show here.
In answer to this question we prove several lower bounds for QCDCL, including
exponential lower bounds for a large class of random QBFs.

We also introduce a strengthening of the decision heuristic used in classical
QCDCL, which does not necessarily decide variables in order of the prefix, but
still allows to learn asserting clauses. We show that with this decision
policy, QCDCL can be exponentially faster on some formulas.

We further exhibit a QCDCL proof system that is p-equivalent to Q-resolution.
In comparison to classical QCDCL, this new QCDCL version adapts both decision
and unit propagation policies.</div>

Both <a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2020/">STOC</a> and <a href="https://computationalcomplexity.org/">Complexity</a> have announced they will go virtual for the summer. <a href="https://icalp2020.saarland-informatics-campus.de/">ICALP</a> moved from Beijing to Saarbrücken to online. I expect every major summer conference and workshop will be cancelled, postponed or virtualized.<br />
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Most CS conferences serve as publication venues and can't be cancelled or postponed. So how do we virtualize a conference? The ACM has an evolving <a href="https://people.clarkson.edu/~jmatthew/acm/VirtualConferences_GuideToBestPractices_CURRENT.pdf">virtual conferences best practices guide</a>. Putting the talks and poster sessions online is not trivial, but relatively straightforward. Personally I go to conferences mostly not for the talks but for the interactions with other participants--the receptions, meal time and just hanging in the hallways. The ACM document describes some approaches like Dagstuhl-style randomized virtual dinner tables. The IEEE VR conference <a href="https://www.cccblog.org/2020/04/02/computing-researchers-respond-to-covid-19-running-a-virtual-conference/">tried virtual reality</a> through <a href="https://hubs.mozilla.com/#/">Mozilla hubs</a>. None of these can truly replicate the on-site experience.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Let me mention two other meetings the <a href="https://games2020.hu/">Game Theory Congress</a> held every four years due to be held in Budapest and the <a href="https://cra.org/conference-at-snowbird/">CRA Snowbird Conference</a>, a meeting of CS department chairs and computing leadership, held every other summer in Utah. Both meetings are not archival publications venues though have several talks and panels. But the main purpose of both is mostly to bring people together, game theorists and CS leaders. I hope they postpone rather than virtualize these meetings. Rather get together a year late than pretend to get together now.</div></div>

<ol><li>This is <em>really</em> getting depressing.  One of the only things that makes it bearable—even though in some sense it shouldn’t—is that most of humanity is in this together.

Namely: <em>Devs</em> consists, precisely, of the <strong>cultural appropriation </strong>of quantum computing.  Now, I never felt like cultural appropriation was the world’s worst problem—not even <em>before</em> a pandemic started overflowing the morgues—so I wouldn’t say I was <em>offended</em> by Alex Garland appropriating the images and buzzwords of my quantum computing tribe for a basically unrelated purpose, but it is what it is.  Again: <em>Devs</em> is the show for you, if you want a haunting, slow-paced, well-produced meditation about free will and determinism and predicting the future and parallel worlds and “what if the whole universe is a simulation?,” and the various ideas I would’ve had about such topics around the age of 11.  It’s just not a show about quantum computing.  I hope that makes it clear.</li><li>I read with interest <a href="https://project-evidence.github.io/">this anonymous but PGP-signed article</a>, laying out the case that it’s <em>plausible</em> that covid accidentally leaked from either the Wuhan Institute of Virology or the Wuhan CDC, rather than originating at the Huanan seafood market.  Or, as an intermediate hypothesis, that an infected animal from one of those labs ended up at the seafood market.  (Note that this is completely different from the hypothesis that covid was purposefully engineered—the authors of the article find that totally implausible, and I agree with them.)  Notably, the Wuhan labs are known to have experimented with bat coronaviruses very much like covid, and are known to have performed “gain-of-function” experiments on them, and were probably the central labs in China for such experiments.  And viruses are known to have leaked from other labs in China on other occasions, and the nature → seafood market route has unresolved issues, like where exactly the crossover from bats to pangolins (or some other intermediate species) is supposed to have happened, such that people would only start getting infected at the seafood market and not at its faraway suppliers, and … well, anyway, read the article and form your own judgment!</li><li>I find it interesting that three months ago, I would’ve hesitated even to share such a link, because my internal critic would’ve screamed “this looks too much like tinfoil-hat stuff—are you ready for all the people you respect sneering at you?”  But the me of three months ago is not the me of today.  I make no apologies for adapting my thoughts to the freak branch of the multiverse where I actually find myself.</li></ol>

<p>The graph below is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series-parallel_graph">series-parallel graph</a>. It can be put together from four smaller series-parallel graphs, each constructed recursively in the same way, by performing a series composition of two pairs and then a parallel composition of the two results.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/binserpar.svg" alt="Series-parallel graph for which all spanning trees have high stretch" /></p>

<p>This family of graphs (although not the radial layout I’m using for it) comes from a paper “Cuts, trees and -embeddings of graphs”, by Anupam Gupta, Ilan Newman, Yuri Rabinovich, and Alistair Sinclair, <em>Combinatorica</em> 2004, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00493-004-0015-x">doi:10.1007/s00493-004-0015-x</a> (see Figure 3, p. 261). They used it to show a lower bound on the average stretch of any spanning tree for these graphs.</p>

<p>Here, given a graph , any edge  of , and any subgraph  of , the stretch of  with respect to  is how much farther you have to go in  to find a path connecting the endpoints of , relative to the unit distance between these endpoints in . For instance, in a cycle graph , every spanning tree is formed by deleting one edge from the cycle. The deleted edge has stretch  (you have to go the long way around to connect its endpoints), but all other edges have stretch , so the average stretch is . More strongly, if you choose the edge to delete randomly, the resulting distribution over spanning trees of  gives every edge expected stretch .</p>

<p>But for the series-parallel graphs of Gupta, Newman, Rabinovich, and Sinclair, such low stretch is not possible. If there are  vertices, then there are  edges. Each edge has stretch at least one.
There are  four-cycles, each of which has at least one missing edge,
with stretch at least three; added to the one unit of stretch that we’ve already counted, the extra stretch from these missing edges is at least .
Removing one edge from each four-cycle leaves  eight-cycles, each of which has at least one more missing edge. The edge that is removed in this way, and the other missing edge from the same four-cycle, have stretch at least seven, adding another ten units per eight-cycle, or  overall, to the total stretch. And so on; at each level of recursion the number of cycles goes down by a factor of four, but the number of edges that need to be cut to break each cycle doubles, as does their length. Therefore, the contribution per level of the recursive construction ends up being linear, and the total stretch is . Thus, as Gupta et al. show, the average stretch for their graphs is .</p>

<p>This result is the background to my newest preprint, “Low-stretch spanning trees of graphs with bounded width” (with Cora Borradaile, Erin Chambers, Will Maxwell, and Amir Nayyeri, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08375">arXiv:2004.08375</a>, to appear at SWAT). From the result of Gupta, we know that having bounded treewidth is not enough to ensure bounded average stretch, or bounded expected stretch. What is? We show that bounded bandwidth is enough to find a distribution over spanning trees with bounded expected stretch, and that bounded cutwidth is enough to find a single spanning tree with bounded average stretch.</p>

<p>This leaves open the question for pathwidth. It was known from another previous work, “Pathwidth, trees, and random embeddings” (James Lee and Tasos Sidiropoulos, <em>Combinatorica</em> 2013, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00493-013-2685-8">doi:10.1007/s00493-013-2685-8</a>) that graphs of bounded pathwidth can be mapped to a random distribution over trees with bounded expected stretch per edge, but the trees of this distribution are not spanning trees. Our new paper includes a conjecture that bounded-pathwidth graphs have distributions over spanning trees with constant average stretch, which if true would generalize our results for both bandwidth and cutwidth.</p>

Previously, even for membership queries and when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U%5Cleq+n%5E%7BO%281%29%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="U\leq n^{O(1)}" class="latex" title="U\leq n^{O(1)}" />, the best known data structure with constant query time requires <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7BOPT%7D%2Bn%2F%5Ctextrm%7Bpoly%7D+%5Clg+n&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="\textrm{OPT}+n/\textrm{poly} \lg n" class="latex" title="\textrm{OPT}+n/\textrm{poly} \lg n" /> bits of space (due to Pagh [Pagh’01] and Pătraşcu [Pat’08]).

<p>Matching is one of the richest gold mines for ideas and results in mathematics, computer science and other areas.  Today I want to briefly tell you about a curious, surprising, mysterious, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07642">cheerful recent result</a> by Gal Beniamini and Noam Nisan and a subsequent work of Vijay Vazirani. It is a result that will cheer up combinatorialists on both sides of the aisle: graph theorists and researchers in extremal and probabilistic combinatorics as well as algebraic and enumerative combinatorialists.  (And it is related to query complexity, Eulerian lattices, Birkhoff’s polytope, a theorem of Lou Billera and Aravamuthan Sarangarajan, evasiveness, analysis of Boolean functions, and various other things.) At the end of the post I will remind you of a central problem in matching theory: that of extending Lovasz’ randomized algorithm for matching to general graphs. (Perhaps methods from algebraic combinatorics can help.)</p>
<p>I will start with sad news. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">John Horton Conway</a>, an amazing mathematical hero,  passed away a few days ago.

And<a href="https://xkcd.com/2293/"> a moving obituary on xkcd</a> with a touch of ingenuity of Conway’s style.

<h2>Bipartite Perfect Matching as a Real Polynomial</h2>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07642">Bipartite Perfect Matching as a Real Polynomial,</a> by Gal Beniamini and Noam Nisan</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We obtain a description of the Bipartite Perfect Matching decision problem as a multilinear polynomial over the Reals. We show that it has full degree and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281-o_n%281%29%29%5Ccdot+2%5E%7Bn%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(1-o_n(1))\cdot 2^{n^2}" class="latex" title="(1-o_n(1))\cdot 2^{n^2}" />  monomials with non-zero coefficients. In contrast, we show that in the dual representation (switching the roles of 0 and 1) the number of monomials is only exponential in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CTheta%28n+%5Clog+n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\Theta(n \log n)" class="latex" title="\Theta(n \log n)" />  Our proof relies heavily on the fact that the lattice of graphs which are “matching-covered” is Eulerian.</p>
<p>And here is how the paper starts</p>
<p>Every Boolean function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En%5Cto%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}" class="latex" title="f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}" /> can be represented in a unique way as a Real multilinear polynomial. This representation and related ones (e.g. using the {1,−1} basis rather than {0,1}– the “Fourier transform” over the hypercube, or approximation variants) have many applications for various complexity and algorithmic purposes. See, e.g., [O’D14] for a recent textbook. In this paper we derive the representation of the bipartite-perfect-matching decision problem as a Real polynomial.</p>
<p><strong>Deﬁnition.</strong> The Boolean function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=BPM_n%28x_%7B1%2C1%7D%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_%7Bn%2Cn%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="BPM_n(x_{1,1},\dots,x_{n,n})" class="latex" title="BPM_n(x_{1,1},\dots,x_{n,n})" /> is deﬁned to be 1 if and only if the bipartite graph whose edges are<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B%28i%2Cj%29%3Ax_%7Bi%2Cj%7D%3D1%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\{(i,j):x_{i,j}=1\}" class="latex" title="\{(i,j):x_{i,j}=1\}" /> has a perfect matching, and 0 otherwise.</p>
<p>And here are the two main theorems regarding this polynomial and the polynomial for the dual representation:</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/bn2.png"><img width="640" alt="" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/bn2.png?w=640&amp;h=138" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19769" height="138" /></a></p>
<p>(For the second theorem you need the notion of totally ordered bipartite graphs.)</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/bn3.png"><img width="640" alt="" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/bn3.png?w=640&amp;h=143" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19770" height="143" /></a></p>
<p>And here is a nice picture!</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/bn4.png"><img width="640" alt="" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/bn4.png?w=640&amp;h=421" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19771" height="421" /></a></p>
<p>A very interesting open problem is:</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Can the Beniamini-Nisan results be extended to general (non-bipartite) graphs</p>
<p>This reminds me of an old great problem:</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Does Lovasz’ randomized algorithm for matching extend to the non-bipartite case?</p>
<p>For both problems methods of algebraic combinatorics may be helpful.</p>
<h2>An Extension by Vijay Vazirani and Thorben Tröbst</h2>
<p class="title mathjax"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08917">A Real Polynomial for Bipartite Graph Minimum Weight Perfect Matchings,</a> Thorben Tröbst, Vijay V. Vazirani</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>In a recent paper, Beniamini and Nisan gave a closed-form formula for the unique multilinear polynomial for the Boolean function determining whether a given bipartite graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G+%5Csubset+K_%7Bn%2Cn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="G \subset K_{n,n}" class="latex" title="G \subset K_{n,n}" /> has a perfect matching, together with an efficient algorithm for computing the coefficients of the monomials of this polynomial. We give the following generalization: Given an arbitrary non-negative weight function <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-2-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-12"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-13"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-14">w</span></span></span></span> on the edges of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_%7Bn%2Cn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="K_{n,n}" class="latex" title="K_{n,n}" />, consider its set of minimum weight perfect matchings. We give the real multilinear polynomial for the Boolean function which determines if a graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G+%5Csubset+K_%7Bn%2Cn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="G \subset K_{n,n}" class="latex" title="G \subset K_{n,n}" /> contains one of these minimum weight perfect matchings.</p>
<h3>Three more remarks about VVV</h3>
<p>Three more VVV remarks: in the Tel Aviv theory <del>fast</del> fest three months ago (it seems like ages ago) Vijay Vazirani gave a lecture about matching. Here is the link to <a href="https://youtu.be/DFGsIOVGOIs">Vijay’s lecture</a>, and to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGRBwz8taWHgpFOqbKQLvm-eAaZz33zM7">all plenary lectures</a>.  At the end, I asked him how he explains that matching theory is such inexhaustable gold mine and Vijay mentioned the fact that a polynomial-time algorithm for the assignment problem (which is closely related to matching) was <a href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~ollivier/JACOBI/presentationlEngl.htm">already found by Jacobi in 1890</a>. (Unfortunately VJ’s inspiring answer was not recorded). A few years ago Vijay<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.4594"> published a simplified proof</a> of a fantastic famous result he first proved with Silvio Micaly 34 years earlier. And here is a most amazing story: a few years ago I went to the beach in Tel Aviv and I discovered Vijay swimming just next to me.  We were quite happy to see each other and Vijay told me a few things about matching, economics and biology. This sounds now like a truly surrealistic story, and perhaps we even shook hands.</p>

</p><p></p><h2> Why Cake Cutting? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Before we talk about cake cutting from a theory viewpoint let’s take a look at why it is interesting. The real answer probably is it is a beautiful math problem. It is easy to state without lots of background. It is simple like Fermat’s Last Theorem: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x%5E%7Bn%7D+%2B+y%5E%7Bn%7D+%3D+z%5E%7Bn%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  x^{n} + y^{n} = z^{n} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  x^{n} + y^{n} = z^{n} " /></p>
<p>has no solutions over the integers with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bxyz+%5Cneq+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{xyz \neq 0}" class="latex" title="{xyz \neq 0}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n&gt;2" class="latex" title="n&gt;2" />. Cake cutting is hard. We like problems that strike back: problems that are not easy to solve. This is a strange view. In real life we might prefer problems that we can easily solve. But not in math. We like problems that are not trivial. The cake cutting problem is hard, so we like it. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Cutting Cakes </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We are theorists so our cakes are one-dimensional line segments. The problem involves a finite set of agents, say Alice, Bob, and so on. They want to divide the cake, the line segment, into a finite number of pieces. The pieces are then allocated to the agents. The goal is to get a fair division of the cake. </p>
<p>
The notion of “fair” is what makes the problem interesting. Often agents will not have the same tastes: Some like icing more than others, some like the end pieces, while others do not. The fact that the agents assign different values to a piece of the cake is what makes the problem challenging. </p>
<p>
If there are two agents the problem has long been solved. Let Bob divide the cake into two pieces, so that he is happy to get either of these pieces. Then have Alice chose which piece she wants. It is easy to see that both Bob and Alice are happy. Both are <i>envy-free</i>: neither would exchange their piece for the others piece. </p>

<p>
There is a large literature on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_cake-cutting">cake-cutting</a> problem. Its creator, Hugo Steinhaus, noted:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Interesting mathematical problems arise if we are to determine the minimal numbers of “cuts” necessary for fair division. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
We have taken the quote from an <a href="https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/envy-free-cake-cutting-procedures-de3cf13c5d3d">article</a> on <em>Medium</em> that neatly conveys details on various protocols. Some main results are: </p>
<ul>
<li>
The Selfridge-Conway discrete procedure produces an envy-free division for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{3}" class="latex" title="{3}" /> people using at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{5}" class="latex" title="{5}" /> cuts. <p></p>
</li><li>
The Brams-Taylor-Zwicker moving knives procedure produces an envy-free division for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{4}" class="latex" title="{4}" /> people using at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B11%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{11}" class="latex" title="{11}" /> cuts. <p></p>
</li><li>
Three different procedures produce an envy-free division for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> people. Both algorithms require a finite but unbounded number of cuts. That is to say, the number of cuts may depend on details of their preference functions. <p></p>
</li><li>
The procedure by Aziz and Mackenzie finds an envy-free division for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> people in a bounded number of cuts.
</li></ul>
<p>The last is the result in the CACM paper. Note, the number of cuts can be large: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++n%5E%7Bn%5E%7Bn%5E%7Bn%5E%7Bn%5E%7Bn%7D%7D%7D%7D%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  n^{n^{n^{n^{n^{n}}}}}. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  n^{n^{n^{n^{n^{n}}}}}. " /></p>
<p>Even for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3D2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n=2}" class="latex" title="{n=2}" /> this is immense, galactic. This should be compared to the best lower bound that is order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n^{2}}" class="latex" title="{n^{2}}" />. This gap is even larger than the usual gaps we find in complexity theory. The P=NP question is only one exponential not five.</p>
<p>
This has started me thinking: what exactly is the relationship between this and <em>proof complexity</em>? The latter has well-established relationships to complexity-class questions. The link from proofs in various systems of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_arithmetic">bounded arithmetic</a> goes through the heart of P=NP. See for instance these <a href="https://www.math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/StPetersburg_BoundedArith_2016/talkAllSlides_Corrected.pdf">slides</a> by Sam Buss and <a href="https://www.math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/Barbados95Notes/reporte.pdf">notes</a> that were scribed by Ken and others. What I am puzzled by is that in most cases the blowup is only one or two exponentials. The setting with cake-cutting is different, but how different? </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Easy Cases </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The Aziz and Mackenzie algorithm takes a long time. It is a nontrivial result, but not one that applies in any practical case. It always takes way too long. The cake will be stale by the time the agents have agreed on their pieces. </p>
<p>
This raises a question, that also applies to many computational problems. Is there a way cut a cake faster on some interesting examples? We can explain this by the analogy to sorting. The fastest sorting algorithms run in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n+%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n \log n)}" class="latex" title="{O(n \log n)}" /> time where there are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> objects. But what happens if the objects are already in sorted order? Or at least close to sorted order? The answer is it depends:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Some sorting algorithms always take the same time, independent of the input structure. <p></p>
</li><li>
There are other sorting algorithms that can take advantage of the nature of the input.
</li></ol>
<p>
That is some sorting algorithms can run say in linear time if the input is almost sorted. For the cake cutting problem we ask:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Is there a way to cut cakes that is envy-free when the agents have some property <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" />?</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
We do not know the answer, but we think it is an interesting question. Here is an example. Suppose that the agents have the same measures. That is, they evaluate every piece of cake in the same way. </p>
<p>
If we <em>know</em> this—and if we continue our supposition above that Bob can cut with exact precision—then there is an easy answer: Have Bob do the cuts. Then all agents will be equally happy since they have the same measures. The question is, what if we do not know? I believe there should be some theorem like this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1 (Conjecture)</b> <em> There is an envy-free algorithm that operates in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E%7B2%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^{2})}" class="latex" title="{O(n^{2})}" /> time the algorithm so that either: </em></p><em>
<ol>
<li>
It yields an envy-free solution, or <p></p>
</li><li>
It determines that some agents have different measures.
</li></ol>
</em><p><em></em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
In the second case the cake will be cut as before. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I originally planned on discussing size and complexity of proofs. This is driven by the complexity of the cake cutting algorithms. They tend to have lots of cases and are difficult to understand.<br />

They are also difficult to find—this is why cake cutting questions have been resistance to progress. More on this in the future. </p>

We prove the equivalence of two fundamental problems in the theory of computation:

- Existence of one-way functions: the existence of one-way functions (which in turn are equivalent to pseudorandom generators, pseudorandom functions, private-key encryption schemes, digital signatures, commitment schemes, and more).
  
- Mild average-case hardness of $K^{poly}$-complexity: the existence of polynomials $t,p$ such that no PPT algorithm can determine the $t$-time bounded Kolmogorov Complexity, $K^t$, for more than a $1-\frac{1}{p(n)}$ fraction of $n$-bit strings.

In doing so, we present the first natural, and well-studied, computational problem characterizing ``non-trivial'' complexity-based Cryptography: ``Non-trivial'' complexity-based Cryptography is possible iff $K^{poly}$ is mildly hard-on average.</div>

Consider the following two fundamental open problems in complexity theory: (a) Does a hard-on-average language in $\NP$ imply the existence of one-way functions?, or (b) Does a hard-on-average language in NP imply a hard-on-average problem in TFNP (i.e., the class of total NP search problem)? Our main result is that the answer to (at least) one of these questions is yes.
 
Both one-way functions and problems in TFNP can be interpreted as promise-true distributional NP search problems---namely, distributional search problems where the sampler only samples true statements. As a direct corollary of the above result, we thus get that the existence of a hard-on-average distributional NP search problem implies a hard-on-average promise-true distributional NP search problem. In other words,” It is no easier to find witnesses (a.k.a. proofs) for efficiently-sampled statements (theorems) that are guaranteed to be true.”?

This result follows from a more general study of interactive puzzles---a generalization of average-case hardness in NP—and in particular, a novel round-collapse theorem for computationally-sound protocols, analogous to Babai-Moran's celebrated round-collapse theorem for information-theoretically sound protocols. As another consequence of this treatment, we show that the existence of O(1)-round public-coin non-trivial arguments (i.e., argument systems that are not proofs) imply the existence of a hard-on-average problem in NP/poly.</div>

Hardness of computing the Kolmogorov complexity of a given string is closely tied to a security proof of hitting set generators, and thus understanding hardness of Kolmogorov complexity is one of the central questions in complexity theory.  In this paper, we develop new proof techniques for showing hardness of computing Kolmogorov complexity under *surprisingly efficient reductions*, which were previously conjectured to be impossible.  It is known that the set $R_K$ of Kolmogorov-random strings is PSPACE-hard under polynomial-time Turing reductions, i.e., $PSPACE \subset P^{R_K}$, and that $NEXP \subset NP^{R_K}$, which was conjectured to be tight by Allender (CiE 2012).  We prove that $EXP^{NP} \subset P^{R_K}$, which simultaneously improves these hardness results and refutes the conjecture of Allender under the plausible assumption that $EXP^{NP} \neq NEXP$.  At the core of our results is a new security proof of a pseudorandom generator via a black-box uniform reduction, which overcomes an impossibility result of Gutfreund and Vadhan (RANDOM/APPROX 2008).

Our proof techniques have further consequences, including:

1.  Applying our proof techniques to the case of resource-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, we obtain NP-hardness of the problem $MINcKT^{SAT}$ of computing conditional polynomial-time-bounded SAT-oracle Kolmogorov complexity under polynomial-time deterministic reductions.  In contrast, the Minimum SAT-Oracle Circuit Size Problem, which is a version of sublinear-time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, cannot be NP-hard under polynomial-time deterministic reductions without resolving $EXP \neq ZPP$.  Our hardness result is the first result that overcomes the non-NP-hardness results of MCSP.  We also prove DistNP-hardness of $MINKT^{SAT}$, which is a partial converse of the approach of Hirahara (FOCS 2018) for proving the equivalence between worst-case and average-case complexity of NP.

2.  We prove $S_2^p$-hardness of Kolmogorov complexity under quasi-polynomial-time *nonadaptive* reductions.  This is the first result that overcomes a P/poly barrier result of Allender, Buhrman, Friedman, and Loff (MFCS 2012).

We also establish a firm link between non-trivial satisfiability algorithms and immunity of random strings, and obtain the following unconditional lower bounds.

1.  It has been a long-standing open question whether the set of subexponential-time-bounded Kolmogorov-random strings is decidable in P.  We resolve this open question, by showing that the set of super-polynomial-time-bounded Kolmogorov-random strings is P-immune, which is a much stronger lower bound than an average-case lower bound.

2.  The set of Levin's Kolmogorov-random strings is (P-uniform ACC)-immune.</div>

We show that Cutting Planes (CP) proofs are hard to find: Given an unsatisfiable formula $F$,

(1) it is NP-hard to find a CP refutation of $F$ in time polynomial in the length of the shortest such refutation; and

(2) unless Gap-Hitting-Set admits a nontrivial algorithm, one cannot find a tree-like CP refutation of $F$ in time polynomial in the length of the shortest such refutation.

The first result extends the recent breakthrough of Atserias and Muller (FOCS 2019) that established an analogous result for Resolution. Our proofs rely on two new lifting theorems: (1) Dag-like lifting for gadgets with many output bits. (2) Tree-like lifting that simulates an $r$-round protocol with gadgets of query complexity $O(\log r)$ independent of input length.</div>

Lifting theorems are a generic way to lift lower bounds in query complexity to lower bounds in communication complexity, with applications in diverse areas, such as combinatorial optimization, proof complexity, game theory. Lifting theorems rely on a gadget, where smaller gadgets give stronger lower bounds. However, existing proof techniques are known to require somewhat large gadgets.

We focus on one of the most widely used gadgets, the index gadget. For this gadget, existing lifting techniques are known to require at least a quadratic gadget size. We develop a new approach to prove lifting theorems for the indexing gadget, based on a novel connection to the recently developed robust sunflower lemmas. We show that this allows to reduce the gadget size to linear. We conjecture that it can be further improved to poly logarithmic, similar to the known bounds for the corresponding robust sunflower lemmas.</div>

We consider codes for space bounded channels. This is a model for communication under noise that was introduced by Guruswami and Smith (J. ACM 2016) and lies between the Shannon (random) and Hamming (adversarial) models. In this model, a channel is a space bounded procedure that reads the codeword in one pass, and modifies at most a $p$ fraction of the bits of the codeword.

Explicit uniquely decodable codes for space bounded channels: Our main result is that for every $0 \le p \le \frac{1}{4}$, there exists a constant $\delta\ge 0$ and a \emph{uniquely decodable} code that is \emph{explicit} (meaning that encoding and decoding are in poly-time) and has rate $1-H(p)$ for channels with space $n^{\delta}$.

This improves upon previous explicit codes by Guruswami and Smith, and Kopparty, Shaltiel and Silbak (FOCS 2019). Specifically, we obtain the same space and rate as earlier works, even though prior work gave only list-decodable codes (rather than uniquely decodable codes).

Complete characterization of the capacity of space bounded channels: Together with a result by Guruswami and Smith showing the impossibility of unique decoding for $p \ge \frac{1}{4}$, our techniques also give a complete characterization of the capacity $R(p)$ of space $n^{1-o(1)}$ channels, specifically: $R(p)=1-H(p)$ for $0 \le p \le 1/4$ and $R(p)=0$ for $p \ge 1/4$.

In particular, $R(\cdot)$ is not continuous at $p=1/4$. This capacity is strictly larger than the capacity of Hamming channels for every $0 \le p \le \frac{1}{4}$, and matches the capacity of list decoding, and binary symmetric channels in this range.


Our results are incomparable to recent work on casual channels. Casual channels are stronger channels in which the channel reads the codeword in one pass, but there is no space restriction. The best known codes for casual channels, due to Chen, Jaggi and Langberg (STOC 2015), are shown to exist by the probabilistic method, and no explicit codes are known. Furthermore, our results imply that for $p\ge p_0 \approx 0.0804$, there is a separation between the capacities of space bounded channels and casual channels, and the capacity of the former is strictly larger than that of the latter.


Our approach builds on previous explicit list decodable codes for space bounded channels. We introduce and study a notion of ``\emph{evasivenss}'' of codes, which is concerned with whether a decoding algorithm rejects a word that is obtained when a channel induces few errors to a \emph{uniformly chosen} string. We use evasiveness (as well as several additional new ideas related to coding theory and pseudorandomness) to identify the ``correct'' message in the list. Loosely speaking, this is achieved by arguing that on ``incorrect messages'' the decoding algorithm cannot distinguish the codeword from a uniform string.</div>

Heged\H{u}s's lemma is the following combinatorial statement regarding polynomials over finite fields. Over a field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $p &gt; 0$ and for $q$ a  power of $p$, the lemma says that any multilinear polynomial $P\in \mathbb{F}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ of degree less than $q$ that vanishes at all points in $\{0,1\}^n$ of Hamming weight $k\in [q,n-q]$ must also vanish at all points in $\{0,1\}^n$ of weight $k + q$. This lemma was used by Heged\H{u}s (2009) to give a solution to \emph{Galvin's problem}, an extremal problem about set systems; by Alon, Kumar and Volk (2018) to improve the best-known multilinear circuit lower bounds; and by Hrube\v{s}, Ramamoorthy, Rao and Yehudayoff (2019) to prove optimal lower bounds against depth-$2$ threshold circuits for computing some symmetric functions. 
		
		In this paper, we formulate a robust version of Heged\H{u}s's lemma. Informally, this version says that if a polynomial of degree $o(q)$ vanishes at most points of weight $k$, then it vanishes at many points of weight $k+q$. We prove this lemma and give the following three different applications.
		
		1. Degree lower bounds for the coin problem: The \emph{$\delta$-Coin Problem} is the problem of distinguishing between a coin that is heads with probability $((1/2) + \delta)$ and a coin that is heads with probability $1/2$. We show that over a field of positive (fixed) characteristic, any polynomial that solves the $\delta$-coin problem with error $\varepsilon$ must have degree $\Omega(\frac{1}{\delta}\log(1/\varepsilon)),$ which is tight up to constant factors.
		
		2. Probabilistic degree lower bounds: The \emph{Probabilistic degree} of a Boolean function is the minimum $d$ such that there is a random polynomial of degree $d$ that agrees with the function at each point with high probability. We give tight lower bounds on the probabilistic degree of \emph{every} symmetric Boolean function over positive (fixed) characteristic. As far as we know, this was not known even for some very simple functions such as unweighted Exact Threshold functions, and constant error.
		
		3. A robust version of the combinatorial result of Heged\H{u}s (2009) mentioned above.</div>
