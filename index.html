<p class="justify-text">Integration by parts is a highlight of any calculus class. It leads to multiple classical applications for integration of logarithms, exponentials, etc., and it is the source of an infinite number of exercises and applications to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_functions">special functions</a>. In this post, I will look at a classical discrete extension that is useful in machine learning and optimization, namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation_by_parts">Abel transformation</a>, with applications to convergence proofs for the (stochastic) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgradient_method">subgradient method</a>. Next month, extensions to higher dimensions will be considered, with applications to score functions [<a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume6/hyvarinen05a/hyvarinen05a.pdf">2</a>, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1914309">3</a>] and randomized smoothing [4, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08676">5</a>].</p>



<h2>Abel transformation: from continuous to discrete</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The most classical version of integration by parts goes as follows. Given two continuously differentiable functions from \(\mathbb{R}\) to \(\mathbb{R}\), we have: $$ \int_a^b \!\!\!\!f(x)g'(x) dx = \Big[ f(x) g(x) \Big]_a^b \!-\! \int_a^b\!\!\! \!f'(x) g(x) dx =  f(b) g(b)\, – f(a)g(a)-\! \int_a^b\! \!\!\! f'(x) g(x) dx.$$ This is valid for less regular functions, but this is not the main concern here. The proof follows naturally from the derivative of a product, but there is a nice “proof without words” (see, e.g., [1, p. 42] or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_parts#Visualization">here</a>).</p>



<p class="justify-text">There is a discrete analogue referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation_by_parts">Abel transformation</a> or summation by parts, where derivatives are replaced by increments: given two real-valued sequences \((a_n)_{n \geq 0}\) and \((b_n)_{n \geq 0}\) (the second sequence could also be taken vector-valued), we can expand $$ \sum_{k=1}^n a_k ( b_k\, – b_{k-1}) =\sum_{k=1}^n a_k  b_k \ – \sum_{k=1}^n a_k  b_{k-1} = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \ – \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_{k+1} b_{k},$$ using a simple index increment in the second sum.  Rearranging terms, this leads to $$ \sum_{k=1}^n a_k ( b_k\, – b_{k-1}) = a_n b_n \ – a_0 b_0\  – \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ( a_{k+1} – a_{k } ) b_k.$$ In other words, we can transfer the first-order difference from the sequence \((b_k)_{k \geq 0}\) to the sequence \((a_k)_{k \geq 0}\).  A few remarks:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Warning</strong>! It is very easy/common to make mistakes with indices and signs.</li><li>I gave the direct proof but a proof through explicit integration by part is also possible, by introducing the piecewise-constant function \(f\) equal to \(a_k\) on \([k,k+1)\), and \(g\) continuous  piecewise affine equal to \(b_{k} + (t-k) ( b_{k+1}-b_{k})\) for \(t \in [k,k+1]\), and integrating between \(0+\) and \(n+\). </li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">There are classical applications for the convergence of series (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation_by_parts">here</a>), but in this post, I will show how it can lead to an elegant result for stochastic gradient descent for non-smooth functions and <em>decaying</em> step-sizes.</p>



<h2>Decaying step-sizes in stochastic gradient descent</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The Abel summation formula is quite useful when analyzing optimization algorithms, and we give a simple example below. We consider a sequence of random potentially <em>non-smooth</em> convex functions \((f_k)_{k \geq 0}\) which are independent and identically distributed functions from \(\mathbb{R}^d \) to \(\mathbb{R}\), with expectation \(F\). The goal is to find a minimizer \(x_\ast\) of \(F\) over a some convex bounded set \(\mathcal{C}\), only being given access to some stochastic gradients of \(f_k\) at well-chosen points. The most classical example is supervised machine learning, where \(f_k(\theta)\) is the loss of a random observation for the predictor parameterized by \(\theta\).  The difficulty here is the potential non-smoothness of the function \(f_k\) (e.g., for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinge_loss">hinge loss</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">support vector machine</a>).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We consider the projected stochastic subgradient descent method. The deterministic version of this method dates back to Naum Shor [6] in 1962 (see nice history <a href="https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/documenta/vol-ismp/43_goffin-jean-louis.pdf">here</a>). The method goes as follows: starting from some \(\theta_0 \in \mathbb{R}^d\), we perform the iteration $$ \theta_{k} = \Pi_{ \mathcal{C} } \big( \theta_{k-1} – \gamma_k  \nabla f_k(\theta_{k-1}) \big),$$ where \(\Pi_{ \mathcal{C}}: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d\) is the orthogonal projection onto the set \(\mathcal{C}\), and \(\nabla f_k(\theta_{k-1})\) is any subgradient of \(f_k\) at \(\theta_{k-1}\). </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="528" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gradient_contours_projection-1024x410.png" class="wp-image-4324" height="211" />One step of projected (sub)gradient descent: from a vector \(\theta\), we go down the direction of a negative subgradient \(\nabla f(\theta)\) of the function \(f\) (here typically a random function) and an orthogonal projection is performed to obtain the new vector \(\theta_+\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We make the following standard assumptions: (a) the set \(\mathcal{C}\) is convex and compact with diameter \(\Delta\) (with respect to the \(\ell_2\)-norm), (b) the functions \(f_k\) are almost surely convex and \(B\)-Lipschitz-continuous (or equivalently with gradients bounded in \(\ell_2\)-norm by \(B\)). We denote by \(\theta_\ast\) a minimizer of \(f\) on \(\mathcal{C}\) (there can be multiple ones). </p>



<p class="justify-text">For non-smooth problems, choosing a constant step-size does not lead to an algorithm converging to a global minimizer: decaying step-sizes are then needed.</p>



<h2>Convergence proof through Lyapunov functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Since the functions \(f_k\) are non-smooth, we cannot use Taylor expansions, and we rely on a now classical proof technique dating back from the 1960’s (see, e.g., a <a href="http://www.mathnet.ru/links/5d71a255cae8f1a313ac599b8f20a123/dan33049.pdf">paper</a> by Boris Polyak [7] in Russian), that has led to several extensions in particular for online learning [<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maz/publications/techconvex.pdf">8</a>]. The proof relies on the concept of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_function">Lyapunov functions</a>“, often also referred to as “potential functions”. This is a non-negative function \(V(\theta_k)\) of the iterates \(\theta_k\), that is supposed to go down along iterations (at least in expectation). In optimization, standard Lyapunov functions are \(V(\theta)  = F(\theta)\, – F(\theta_\ast)\) or \(V(\theta) = \| \theta \ – \theta_\ast\|_2^2\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">For the subgradient method, we will not be able to show that the Lyapunov function is decreasing, but this will lead through a manipulation which is standard in linear dynamical system analysis to a convergence proof for the averaged iterate: that is, if \(V(\theta_k) \leqslant V(\theta_{k-1})\ – W(\theta_{k-1}) + \varepsilon_k\),  for a certain function \(W\) and extra positive terms \(\varepsilon_k\), then, using telescoping sums, $$ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n W(\theta_{k-1}) \leqslant \frac{1}{n} \big( V(\theta_0)\ – V(\theta_n) \big) + \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \varepsilon_k.$$ We can then either use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%27s_inequality">Jensen’s inequality</a> to get a bound on \(W \big( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \theta_{k-1} \big)\), or directly get a bound on \(\min_{k \in \{1,\dots,n\}} W(\theta_{k-1})\). The first solution gives a performance guarantee for a well-defined iterate, while the second solution only shows that among the first \(n-1\) iterates, one of them has a performance guarantee; in the stochastic set-up where latex \(W\) is an expectation, it is not easily possible to know which one, so we will consider only averaging below.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Standard inequality. </strong>We have, by contractivity of orthogonal projections: $$ \|\theta_k \ – \theta_\ast\|_2^2 =  \big\|  \Pi_{ \mathcal{C} } \big( \theta_{k-1} – \gamma_k   \nabla f_k(\theta_{k-1}) \big) – \Pi_{ \mathcal{C} } (\theta_\ast)  \big\|_2^2 \leqslant  \big\|   \theta_{k-1} – \gamma_k  \nabla f_k(\theta_{k-1}) -\   \theta_\ast  \big\|_2^2.$$ We can then expand the squared Euclidean norm to get: $$ \|\theta_k – \theta_\ast\|_2^2 \leqslant  \|\theta_{k-1} – \theta_\ast\|_2^2 \ – 2\gamma_k (\theta_{k-1} – \theta_\ast)^\top \nabla f_k (\theta_{k-1}) + \gamma_k^2 \|  \nabla f_k(\theta_{k-1})\|_2^2.$$ The last term is upper-bounded by \(\gamma_k^2 B^2\) because of the regularity assumption on \(f_k\). For the middle term, we use the convexity of \(f_k\), that is,  the function \(f_k\) is greater than its tangent at \(\theta_{k-1}\). See figure below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="513" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tangent_convex-1-1024x440.png" class="wp-image-4331" height="220" />Convex function above its tangent at \(\theta_{k-1}\), leading to the desired inequality.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We then obtain $$ f_k(\theta_\ast) \geqslant f_k(\theta_{k-1}) + \nabla f_k(\theta_{k-1})^\top ( \theta_{\ast} – \theta_{k-1}).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">Putting everything together, this leads to $$ \|\theta_k \ – \theta_\ast\|_2^2 \leqslant  \|\theta_{k-1}\  – \theta_\ast\|_2^2 \ – 2\gamma_k  \big[ f_k(\theta_{k-1}) \ – f_k(\theta_\ast) \big] + \gamma_k^2 B^2.$$ At this point, except the last term, all terms are random. We can now take expectations, with a particular focus on the term \(\mathbb{E} \big[ f_k(\theta_{k-1}) \big]\), for which we can use the fact that the random function \(f_k\) is independent from the past, so that $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ f_k(\theta_{k-1}) \big] =  \mathbb{E} \Big[  \mathbb{E} \big[ f_k(\theta_{k-1}) \big| f_{1},\dots,f_{k-1}  \big] \Big] =\mathbb{E} \big[   F(\theta_{k-1})   \big] . $$ We thus get $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ \|\theta_k – \theta_\ast\|_2^2\big] \leqslant  \mathbb{E} \big[ \|\theta_{k-1} – \theta_\ast\|_2^2\big]  – 2\gamma_k \big( \mathbb{E} \big[ F(\theta_{k-1}) \big] – F(\theta_\ast) \big) + \gamma_k^2 B^2.$$ As above, we can now isolate the excess in function values as: $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ F(\theta_{k-1}) \big] – F(\theta_\ast)  \leqslant \frac{1}{2 \gamma_k} \Big( \mathbb{E} \big[ \|\theta_{k-1} – \theta_\ast\|_2^2\big] – \mathbb{E} \big[ \|\theta_{k} – \theta_\ast\|_2^2\big] \Big) + \frac{\gamma_k}{2} B^2.$$ At this point, the “optimization part” of the proof is done. Only algebraic manipulations are needed to obtain a convergence rate. This is where Abel transformation will come in.</p>



<h2>From fixed horizon to anytime algorithms</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>The lazy way.</strong> At this point, many authors (including me sometimes) will take a constant step-size \(\gamma_k = \gamma\) so as to obtain a telescopic sum, leading to $$ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \mathbb{E} \big[ F(\theta_{k-1}) \big] – F(\theta_\ast) \leqslant \frac{1}{2n\gamma}     \Big( \mathbb{E} \big[ \|\theta_{0} \ – \theta_\ast\|_2^2\big] – \mathbb{E} \big[ \|\theta_{n}\  – \theta_\ast\|_2^2\big] \Big) + \frac{\gamma}{2} B^2,$$ which is less than \(\displaystyle \frac{\Delta^2}{2n \gamma} + \frac{\gamma}{2} B^2\), and minimized for \(\displaystyle \gamma = \frac{ \Delta}{B \sqrt{n}}\), leading to a convergence rate less than \(\displaystyle \frac{ B \Delta}{\sqrt{n}}\). Using Jensen’s inequality, we then get for \(\bar{\theta}_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \theta_{k-1}\): $$\mathbb{E} \big[ F(\bar{\theta}_{n}) \big] – F(\theta_\ast) \leqslant \frac{ B \Delta}{\sqrt{n}} .$$ This result leads to the desired rate but can be improved in at least one way: the step-size currently has to depend on the “horizon” \(n\) (which has to be known in advance), and the algorithm is not “anytime”, which is not desirable in practice (where one often launches an algorithm and stops it when it the performance gains have plateaued or when the user gets bored waiting).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Non-uniform averaging.</strong> Another way [<a href="https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~nemirovs/SIOPT_RSA_2009.pdf">9</a>] is to consider the non-uniform average $$ \eta_{k} =   \frac{\sum_{k=1}^n \gamma_{k} \theta_{k-1}}{\sum_{k=1}^n \gamma_{k}}, $$ for which telescoping sums apply as before, to get $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ F(\eta_k) \big] – F(\theta_\ast) \leqslant \frac{1}{2} \frac{\Delta^2 + B^2 \sum_{k=1}^n \gamma_k^2}{\sum_{k=1}^n \gamma_{k}}.$$  Then, by selecting a decaying step-size \(\displaystyle \gamma_k = \frac{ \Delta}{B \sqrt{k}}\), that depends on the iteration number, we get a rate proportional to \(\displaystyle \frac{ B \Delta}{\sqrt{n}} ( 1 + \log n)\). We now have an anytime algorithm, but we have lost a logarithmic term, which is not the end of the world, but still disappointing. In [<a href="https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~nemirovs/SIOPT_RSA_2009.pdf">9</a>], “tail-averaging” (only averaging iterates between a constant times \(n\) and \(n\)) is proposed, that removes the logarithmic term but requires to store iterates (moreover, the non-uniform averaging puts too much weight on the first iterates, slowing down convergence).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Using Abel transformation.</strong> If we start to sum inequalities from \(k=1\) to \(k=n\), we get, with \(\delta_k = \mathbb{E} \big[ \|\theta_{k} – \theta_\ast\|_2^2\big]\) (which is always between \(0\) and \(\Delta^2\)): $$ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \mathbb{E} \big[ F(\theta_{k-1}) \big] – F(\theta_\ast)  \leqslant  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \bigg( \frac{1}{2 \gamma_k} \Big( \delta_{k-1} –  \delta_k \Big)\bigg) +  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\gamma_k}{2} B^2,$$ which can be transformed through Abel transformation into $$ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \mathbb{E} \big[ F(\theta_{k-1}) \big] – F(\theta_\ast) \leqslant \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}  {\delta_k} \bigg(\frac{1}{ 2 \gamma_{k+1}}- \frac{1}{ 2 \gamma_{k}} \bigg) + \frac{\delta_0}{2 n \gamma_1}- \frac{\delta_t}{2 n \gamma_t}+ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\gamma_k}{2} B^2.$$ For decreasing step-size sequences, this leads to $$ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \mathbb{E} \big[ F(\theta_{k-1}) \big] – F(\theta_\ast) \leqslant \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} {\Delta^2} \bigg(\frac{1}{ 2\gamma_{k+1}}- \frac{1}{ 2\gamma_{k}} \bigg) + \frac{\Delta^2}{2n \gamma_1}+ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\gamma_k}{2} B^2,$$ and thus $$ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \mathbb{E} \big[ F(\theta_{k-1}) \big] – F(\theta_\ast) \leqslant \frac{\Delta^2 }{2 n \gamma_n} + \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\gamma_k}{2} B^2.$$ For \(\gamma_k = \frac{  \Delta}{B \sqrt{k}}\), this leads to an upper bound $$\frac{\Delta B }{2 \sqrt{n}} \big( 1+ \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\big) \leqslant \frac{3 \Delta B }{2 \sqrt{n}},$$ which is up to a factor \(\frac{3}{2}\) exactly the same bound as with a constant step-size, but now with an anytime algorithm.</p>



<h2>Experiments</h2>



<p class="justify-text">To illustrate the behaviors above, let’s consider minimizing \(\mathbb{E}_x \| x – \theta \|_1\), with respect to \(\theta\), with \(f_k(\theta) = \| x_k- \theta\|_1\), where \(x_k\) is sampled independently from a given distribution (here independent log-normal distributions for each coordinate). The global optimum \(\theta_\ast\) is the per-coordinate median of the distribution of \(x\)’s.</p>



<p class="justify-text">When applying SGD, the chosen subgradient of \(f_k\) has components in \(\{-1,1\}\). Hence in the plots below in two dimensions, the iterates are always on a grid. With a constant step-size: if the \(\gamma\) is too large (right), there are large oscillations, while if \(\gamma\) is too small (left), optimization is too slow. Note that while the SGD iterate with a constant step-size is always oscillating, the averaged iterate converges to some point (which is not the global optimum, and is typically at distance \(O(\gamma)\) away from it [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06386">11</a>]).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img width="545" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sgd-1.gif" class="wp-image-4339" height="230" />Stochastic gradient descent (averaged or not), with constant step-size. Left: small step-size. Right: large step-size (8 times larger).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">With a decaying step-size (figure below), the initial conditions are forgotten reasonably fast and the iterates converge to the global optimum (and of course, we get an anytime algorithm!).</p>

<p>We can now compare in terms of function values, showing that a constant step-size only works well for a specific range of iteration numbers.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="371" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/convergence_proofs.png" class="wp-image-4335" height="276" />Comparison of expected performance for decaying and constant-step sizes. Several constant step-sizes are tested, with uniform spacings in log-scale (hence the the uniform spacings in performance for large \(n\)).</figure></div>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Being able to deal with decaying step-sizes and anytime algorithms is arguably not a major improvement, but quite a satisfactory one, at least to me! Discrete integration by parts is the key enabler here.</p>



<p class="justify-text">There is another rewarding aspect which is totally unrelated to integration by parts: when applied to supervised machine learning, we just obtained from elementary principles (convexity) and few calculations a generalization bound <em>on unseen data</em>, which is as good as regular bounds from statistics [<a href="https://www.esaim-ps.org/articles/ps/pdf/2005/01/ps0420.pdf">10</a>] that use much more complex tools such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rademacher_complexity">Rademacher complexities</a> (but typically no convexity assumptions): here, statistics considered independently from optimization is not only slower (considering the empirical risk and minimizing it using the plain non-stochastic subgradient method would lead to an \(n\) times slower algorithm) but also more difficult to analyze! </p>

<p>When I was in grad school a common advice for beginning grad students was to leaf through the (paper) STOC or FOCS proceedings to see papers that you are interested in. This is still a decent advice (and requires less physical strength these days <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt="🙂" /> ) but papers are not always the best source for people starting out. More often than we’d like to, the author of the 10th paper on a topic writes it to the audience of people that read (in fact probably wrote) the previous 9 papers.</p>



<p>Talks often do a better job of giving an overview of the field, and one great resource is the <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/videos">videos</a> from the Simons Institute. If you want to get more in-depth information about a particular topic, it’s hard to beat the extended surveys in <a href="https://www.nowpublishers.com/TCS">Foundations and Trends in TCS</a>, as well as the related areas such as <a href="https://www.nowpublishers.com/MAL">Machine Learning</a> and <a href="https://www.nowpublishers.com/CIT">Information Theory</a>. </p>



<p>But if you are not yet sure what topic you’re interested in, or perhaps not even sure if you want to go to grad school, but you just know that you are interested in theory, there is now a new great resource. As I learned from <a href="https://twitter.com/BooleanAnalysis/status/1286658578049359873">Twitter</a>, Ryan O’Donnell has just finished his <a href="https://www.diderot.one/course/28/">TCS Toolkit course</a>.

<p>The topics are the following (these links are to the handwritten notes, for the lecture videos see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prI35GmCon4&amp;list=PLm3J0oaFux3ZYpFLwwrlv_EHH9wtH6pnX">YouTube channel</a>):</p>

<p>3rd SIAM <a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/sosa21">Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms </a> (SOSA)<br />January 11-12, 2021<br />Alexandria, Virginia, U.S.<br />(Held jointly with SODA 2021)<br /><br />Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms (SOSA) is a conference in theoretical computer science dedicated to advancing algorithms research by promoting simplicity and elegance in the design and analysis of algorithms. The benefits of simplicity are manifold: simpler algorithms manifest a better understanding of the problem at hand; they are more likely to be implemented and trusted by practitioners; they can serve as benchmarks, as an initialization step, or as the basis for a “state of the art” algorithm;  they are more easily taught and are more likely to be included in algorithms textbooks; and they attract a broader set of researchers to difficult algorithmic problems.<br /><br />Papers in all areas of algorithms research are sought.  An ideal submission will advance our understanding of an algorithmic problem by, for example, introducing a simpler algorithm, presenting a simpler analysis of an existing algorithm, or offering insights that generally simplify our understanding of important algorithms or computational problems.<br /><br />We are especially interested in papers that make material more accessible to a wider audience, such as undergraduates, or for more specialized topics, general algorithms researchers.<br /><br />Submissions should contain novel ideas or attractive insights, but they are not expected to prove novel theorems. That is, the results themselves can be known, but their presentation must be new.

<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, we continue our investigation of gradient flows for wide two-layer “relu” neural networks. In the <a href="https://francisbach.com/gradient-descent-neural-networks-global-convergence/">previous post</a>, Francis explained that under suitable assumptions these dynamics converge to global minimizers of the training objective. Today, we build on this to understand qualitative aspects of the predictor learnt by such neural networks. The content is mostly based on our recent joint work [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04486.pdf">1</a>].</p>



<h2>1. Generalization with weight decay regularization</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Let us start our journey with the comfortable case where the training objective includes an explicit <em>weight decay</em> regularization (i.e. \(\ell_2\)-regularization on the parameters). Using the notations of the previous post, this consists in the following objective function on the space of probability measures on \(\mathbb{R}^{d+1}\):  $$ \underbrace{R\Big(\int_{\mathbb{R}^{d+1}} \Phi(w)d\mu(w)\Big)}_{\text{Data fitting term}} + \underbrace{\frac{\lambda}{2} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d+1}} \Vert w \Vert^2_2d\mu(w)}_{\text{Regularization}} \tag{1}$$ where \(R\) is the loss and \(\lambda&gt;0\) is the regularization strength. Remember that a  neural network of finite width with \(m\) neurons is recovered with an empirical measure \(\mu = \frac1m \sum_{j=1}^m\delta_{w_j}\), in which case this regularization is proportional to the sum of the squares of all the parameters \(\frac{\lambda}{2m}\sum_{j=1}^m \Vert w_j\Vert^2_2\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Variation norm.</strong> In the previous post, we have seen that the Wasserstein gradient flow of this objective function — an idealization of the gradient descent training dynamics in the large width limit — converges to a global minimizer \(\mu^*\) when initialized properly. An example of an admissible initialization is the hidden weights \(b_j\) distributed according to the uniform distribution \(\tau\) on the unit sphere \(\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\subset \mathbb{R}^d\) and the output weights \(a_j\) uniform in \(\{-1,1\}\). What does this minimizer look like in predictor space when the objective function is as in Eq. (1) ? </p>



<p class="justify-text">To answer this question, we define for a predictor \(h:\mathbb{R}^d\to \mathbb{R}\), the quantity $$ \Vert h \Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1} := \min_{\mu \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d+1})} \frac{1}{2} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d+1}} \Vert w\Vert^2_2 d\mu(w) \quad \text{s.t.}\quad h = \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d+1}} \Phi(w)d\mu(w).\tag{2} $$ As the notation suggests, \(\Vert \cdot \Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1}\) is a norm in the space of predictors. It is known as the <em>variation norm</em> [<a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/14-546/14-546.pdf">2</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.cas.cz/~vera/publications/journals/I3Edin.pdf">3</a>]. We call \(\mathcal{F}_1\) the space of functions with finite norm, which is a Banach space. By construction, the learnt predictor \(h^* = \int \Phi(w)d\mu^*(w)\) is a minimizer of the \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-regularized regression: $$ \min_{h:\mathbb{R}^d\to \mathbb{R}} R(h) + \lambda \Vert h \Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1} \tag{3}.$$ This \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-norm regularization shares similarity with \(\ell_1\) regularization [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6614.pdf">4</a>]. To see this, observe that the “magnitude” \(\vert a\vert \Vert b\Vert_2\) of a relu function \(x\mapsto a(b^\top x)_+\) with parameter \(w=(a,b)\) equals \(\Vert w\Vert^2_2/2\) if \(\vert a\vert = \Vert b\Vert_2\) and is smaller otherwise. Thus parameterizing the relus by their direction \(\theta = b/\Vert b\Vert_2\) and optimizing over their signed magnitude \(r(\theta) = a\Vert b\Vert_2\)  we have $$ \Vert h \Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1} = \inf_{r:\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\to \mathbb{R}} \int_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} \vert r(\theta)\vert d\tau(\theta) \quad \text{s.t.}\quad h(x) = \int _{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} r(\theta) (\theta^\top x)_+ d\tau(\theta).\tag{4}$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Conjugate RKHS norm.</strong> The regression in the space \(\mathcal{F}_1\) is best understood when compared with the regression obtained by only training the output weights. We consider the same training dynamics with weight decay except that we fix the hidden weights to their initial value, where they are distributed according to the uniform distribution \(\tau\) on the sphere. In that case, the Wasserstein gradient flow also converges to the solution of a regularized regression as in Eq. (3) — this is in fact a convex problem —  but the regularizing norm is different and now defined as $$ \Vert h \Vert_{\mathcal{F}_2}^2 := \min_{r:\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\to \mathbb{R}} \int_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} \vert r(\theta)\vert^2 d\tau(\theta) \quad \text{s.t.}\quad h(x) = \int _{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} r(\theta) (\theta^\top x)_+ d\tau(\theta).$$ We call \(\mathcal{F}_2\) the set of functions with finite norm. It can be shown to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_space">Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space</a> (RKHS), with kernel  $$ K(x,x’) = \int_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} (\theta^\top x)_+ (\theta^\top x’)_+ d\tau(\theta),$$ which has a closed form expression [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3628-kernel-methods-for-deep-learning.pdf">5</a>]. In this context, taking a finite width neural network corresponds to a random feature approximation of the kernel [<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.446.9306&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">6</a>, <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3182-random-features-for-large-scale-kernel-machines">7</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Let us informally compare the properties of these spaces \(\mathcal{F}_1\) and \(\mathcal{F}_2\) (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8690">2</a>] for details):</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Approximation power.</strong> In high dimension, only very smooth functions have small \(\mathcal{F}_2\)-norm (in rough terms, the \(\lceil (d+3)/2\rceil\) first derivatives should be small). In contrast, there exists non-smooth functions with small \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-norm, an example being the relu function \(x\mapsto (\theta^\top x)_+\). Remarkably, if we define \(f(x)=g(Ux)\) where \(U\) is an orthogonal projection then \(\Vert f\Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1} \leq  \Vert g\Vert_{\mathcal{F}_2}\). This shows in particular that \(\mathcal{F}_1\) contains \(\mathcal{F}_2\) and that \(\mathcal{F}_1\) is <em>adaptive</em> to lower dimensional structures.</li><li><strong>Statistical complexity.</strong> It could be feared that the good approximation properties of \(\mathcal{F}_1\) come at the price of being “too large” as a hypothesis space, making it difficult to estimate a predictor in \(\mathcal{F}_1\) from few samples. But, as measured by their Rademacher complexities, the unit ball of \(\mathcal{F}_1\) is only \(O(\sqrt{d})\) larger than that of \(\mathcal{F}_2\). By going from \(\mathcal{F}_2\) to \(\mathcal{F}_1\), we thus add some nicely structured predictors to our hypothesis space, but not too much garbage that could fit unstructured noise.</li><li><strong>Generalization guarantees.</strong> By combining the two previous points, it is possible to prove that supervised learning in \(\mathcal{F}_1\) breaks the curse of dimensionality when the output depends on a lower dimensional projection of the input: the required number of training samples only depends mildly on the dimension \(d\).</li><li><strong>Optimization guarantees.</strong> However \(\mathcal{F}_1\) has a strong drawback : there is no known algorithm that solves the problem of Eq. (3) in polynomial time. On practical problems, gradient descent seems to behave well, but in general only qualitative results such as presented in the previous post are known. In contrast, various provably efficient algorithms can solve regression in \(\mathcal{F}_2\), which is a classical kernel ridge regression problem [Chap. 14.4.3, <a href="https://doc.lagout.org/science/Artificial%20Intelligence/Machine%20learning/Machine%20Learning_%20A%20Probabilistic%20Perspective%20%5BMurphy%202012-08-24%5D.pdf">8</a>].</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">In the plot below, we compare the predictor learnt by gradient descent for a 2-D regression with the square loss and weight decay, after training (a) both layers — which is regression in \(\mathcal{F}_1\) — or (b) just the output layer — which is regression in \(\mathcal{F}_2\). This already illustrates some distinctive features of both spaces, although the differences become more stringent in higher dimensions. In particular, observe that in (a) the predictor is the combination of few relu functions, which illustrates  the sparsifying effect of the \(L^1\)-norm in Eq. (4). To simplify notations, we do not include a bias/intercept in the formulas but our numerical experiments include it, so in this plot the input is of the form \(x=(x_1,x_2,1)\) and \(d=3\).</p>

<p class="justify-text">The qualitative picture is quite clear so far, but something is a bit unsettling: weight decay is often not needed to obtain a good performance in practice. Our line of reasoning however completely falls apart without such a regularization: if the objective function depends on the predictor only via its values on the training set, being a minimizer does not guarantee anything about generalization outside of the training set (remember that wide relu neural networks are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem">universal approximators</a>). Why does it still work in the unregularized case? There must be something in the algorithm…</p>



<h2>2. Implicit bias: linear classification</h2>



<p class="justify-text">This something is called the <em>implicit bias</em> : when there are several minimizers, the optimization algorithm makes a specific choice. In the unregularized case, the “quality” of this choice is a crucial property of an algorithm; much more crucial than, say, its convergence speed on the training objective. To gradually build our intuition of the implicit bias of gradient flows, let us put neural networks aside for a moment and consider, following Soudry, Hoffer, Nacson, Gunasekar and Srebro [<a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume19/18-188/18-188.pdf">9</a>], a linear classification task.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Gradient flow of the smooth-margin.</strong> Let \((x_i,y_i)_{i=1}^n\) be a training set of \(n\) pairs of inputs \(x_i\in \mathbb{R}^d\) and outputs \(y_i\in \{-1,1\}\) and let us choose the exponential loss. The analysis that follows also apply to the logistic loss (which is the same as the cross-entropy loss after a sigmoid non-linearity) because only the “tail” of the loss matters, but it is more straightforward with the exponential loss. In order to give a natural “scale” to the problem, we  renormalize the empirical risk by taking minus its logarithm and consider the concave objective $$ F_\beta(a) = -\frac{1}{\beta}\log\Big( \frac1n \sum_{i=1}^n \exp(-\beta y_i \ x_i^\top a) \Big).\tag{5}$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">Here \(\beta&gt;0\) is a parameter that will be useful in a moment. For now, we take \(\beta=1\) and we note \(F(a)=F_1(a)\).  In this context, the <em>margin</em> of a vector \(a\in \mathbb{R}^d\) is the quantity \(\min_{i} y_i\ x_i^\top a\) which quantifies how far this linear predictor is from making a wrong prediction on the training set.  </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="453" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/max_margin-4.png" class="wp-image-4274" height="386" />The margin of the linear predictor \(x \mapsto a^\top x\) with parameters \(a \in \mathbb{S}^{d-1}\) is the smallest distance of a training point to the decision boundary. We show here the max-margin predictor.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Obtained via simple manipulations, the inequalities  $$ \min_i y_i\ x_i^\top a \leq F_\beta(a) \leq \min_i y_i\ x_i^\top a +\frac{\log(n)}{\beta}, \tag{6}$$ suggest to call \(F_\beta\) the <em>smooth-margin</em> because, well, it is smooth and converges to the margin \(F_\infty(a) := \min_i y_i x_i^\top a\) as \(\beta\to \infty\). Let us look at the gradient flow in the ascent direction that maximizes the smooth-margin: $$ a'(t) = \nabla F(a(t))$$ initialized with \(a(0)=0\) (here the initialization does not matter so much). The path followed by this gradient flow is exactly the same as the gradient flow on the empirical risk: taking the logarithm only changes the time parameterization or, in practice, the step-size.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Convergence to the max-margin.</strong> Assume that the data set is linearly separable, which means that the \(\ell_2\)-max-margin $$ \gamma := \max_{\Vert a\Vert_2 \leq 1} \min_i y_i x_i^\top a$$ is positive. In this case \(F\) is unbounded (indeed \(\lim_{\alpha \to \infty} F(\alpha a) =\infty\) whenever \(a\)  has a positive margin) and thus \(a(t)\) diverges. This is not an issue as such, since for classification, only the sign of the prediction matters.  This just means that the relevant question is not “where does \(a(t)\) converge?” but rather “towards which direction does it diverge?”. In other words, we are interested in the limit of \(\bar a(t):= a(t)/\Vert a(t)\Vert_2\) (in convex analysis, this is called the <em>cosmic limit</em> of \(a(t)\) [Chap. 3, <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540627722">10</a>], isn’t it beautiful ?).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The argument that follows is adapted from [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08246.pdf">11</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07300.pdf">12</a>] and can be traced back to [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/telgarsky13-supp.pdf">13</a>] for coordinate ascent. It can be shown by looking at the structure of the gradient (see the end of the blog post) that \(\Vert \nabla F(a)\Vert_2\geq \gamma\) for all \(a\in \mathbb{R}^d\). By the inequality of Eq. (6) and the gradient flow property \(\frac{d}{dt}F(a(t))=\Vert \nabla F(a(t))\Vert_2^2\), it follows $$\begin{aligned}\min_i y_i x_i^\top a(t) \geq F(a(t)) \  – \log(n) \geq \gamma \int_0^t \Vert \nabla F(a(s))\Vert_2ds -\log (n).\end{aligned}$$  For \(t&gt; \log(n)/\gamma^2\), this lower bound is positive. We can then divide the left-hand side by \(\Vert a(t)\Vert_2\) and the right-hand side by the larger quantity \(\int_0^t \Vert\nabla F(a(s))\Vert_2ds\), and we get $$\min_i y_i x_i^\top \bar a(t) \geq \gamma -\frac{\log(n)}{\int_0^t \Vert\nabla F(a(s))\Vert_2ds} \geq \gamma -\frac{\log(n)}{\gamma t}.$$ This shows that the margin of \(\bar a(t) := a(t)/\Vert a(t)\Vert_2\) converges to the \(\ell_2\)-max-margin at a rate \(\log(n)/\gamma t\). That’s it, the implicit bias of this gradient flow is exposed!</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Stability to step-size choice.</strong> To translate this argument to discrete time, we need decreasing step-sizes of order \(1/\sqrt{t}\) which deteriorates the convergence rate to \(\tilde O(1/\sqrt{t})\), see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08246.pdf">11</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07300.pdf">12</a>]. In [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04486.pdf">1</a>], we proposed a different proof strategy (based on an online optimization interpretation of \(\bar a(t)\), as below) which recovers the same convergence rate \(O(1/\sqrt{t})\) with <em>exponentially larger</em> step-sizes. This suggests that these diverging trajectories are extremely robust to the choice of step-size.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Illustration. </strong>In the figure below, we plot on the left the evolution of the parameter \(a(t)\) and on the right the predictor \(x\mapsto (x,1)^\top a(t)\) with \(x\in \mathbb{R}^2\). In parameter space, we apply the hyperbolic tangent to the radial component which allows to easily visualize diverging trajectories. This way, the unit sphere represents the <em>horizon</em> of \(\mathbb{R}^d\), i.e., the set of directions at infinity [Chap. 3 in <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540627722">9</a>]. We will use the same convention in the other plots below.</p>

<h2>3. Implicit bias:  training only the output layer</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Despite its apparently restrictive setting, the previous result already tells us something about wide neural networks. Consider the situation touched upon earlier where we only train the output weights \(a_j\) and the hidden weights \(b_j\) are picked uniformly at random on the sphere. This corresponds to learning a linear classifier on top of the random feature \([(b_j^\top x)_+]_{j=1}^m\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">As we have just shown, if the training set is separable, the normalized gradient flow of the unregularized exponential loss (or logistic loss) converges to a solution to  $$ \max_{\Vert a\Vert_2 \leq 1}\min_i y_i \sum_{j=1}^m  a_j (b_j^\top x_i)_+.$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">This is a random feature approximation for the unregularized kernel support vector machine problem in the RKHS \(\mathcal{F}_2\), which is recovered in the large width limit \(m\to \infty\):  $$\max_{\Vert h\Vert_{\mathcal{F}_2}\leq 1} \min_i y_i h(x_i).$$ Notice that if \(m\) is large enough, the linear separability assumption is not even needed anymore, because any training set is separable in \(\mathcal{F}_2\) (at least if all \(x_i\)s are distinct and if we do not forget to include the bias/intercept).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Illustration.</strong> In the animation below, we plot on the left the evolution of the parameters and on the right the predictor for a 2-D classification task. In parameter space, each particle represents a neuron: their direction is fixed, their distance to \(0\) is their absolute weight and the color is red (+) or blue (-) depending on the sign of the weight. As above, the unit sphere is at infinity and the particles diverge. In predictor space, the markers represent the training samples of both classes, the color shows the predictor and the black line is the decision boundary. The fact that the predictor has a smooth decision boundary is in accordance with the properties of \(\mathcal{F}_2\) given above. </p>

<h2>4. Implicit bias: 2-homogeneous linear classifiers</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Although the analyses where neural networks behave like kernel methods are pleasant for us theoreticians because we are in conquered territory, they miss essential aspects of neural networks such as their adaptivity and their ability to learn a representation. Let us see if we can characterize the implicit bias of the gradient flow of the unregularized exponential loss when training <em>both</em> layers of the neural network.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>A 2-homogeneous linear model.</strong> From an optimization point of view, an important property of two layer relu neural networks is that \(\Phi(\alpha w)= \alpha^2 \Phi(w)\) for all \(\alpha&gt;0\), i.e., they are positively 2-homogeneous in the training parameters. In contrast, a linear model is 1-homogeneous in the parameters. This seemingly little difference leads to drastic changes in the gradient flow dynamics. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Let us again build our intuition with a simplified model that captures key aspects of the dynamics, namely the linear classification setting of above. This time, we take any initialization \(r(0)\in \mathbb{R}^d\) with positive entries and the gradient flow in the ascent direction of the function \( F(r\odot r)\) where \(\odot\) is the elementwise product between two vectors and \(F\) is defined in Eq. (5). This is just a trick to obtain a 2-homogeneous parameterization of a linear model. This gradient flow satisfies $$ r'(t) = 2 r(t)\odot \nabla F(r(t)\odot r(t)).$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Normalized dynamics.</strong> Let us define \(\bar a(t):=(r(t)\odot r(t))/\Vert r(t)\Vert_2^2\) the normalized predictor associated to our dynamics which, by definition, belongs to the simplex \(\Delta_d\), i.e., the set of nonnegative vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) that sum to one. Using the fact that \(\nabla F(\beta a) = \nabla F_\beta (a)\) for all \(\beta&gt;0\), we obtain $$\begin{aligned} \bar a'(t) &amp;= 2\frac{r(t)\odot r'(t)}{\Vert r(t)\Vert_2^2} -2 (r(t)^\top r'(t))\frac{r(t)\odot r(t)}{\Vert r(t)\Vert_2^4}\\ &amp;=4\bar a(t) \odot \nabla F_{\Vert r(t)\Vert_2^2}(\bar a(t))\ – \alpha(t) \bar a(t)\end{aligned}$$ where \(\alpha(t)\) is the scalar such that \(\sum_{i=1}^d a’_i(t) =0\). Online optimization experts might have recognized that this is (continuous time) <em>online mirror ascent in the simplex</em> for the sequence of smooth-margin functions \(F_{\Vert r(t)\Vert_2^2}\). Notice in particular the multiplicative updates: they correspond to the entropy mirror function, and they are particularly well suited for optimization in the high dimensional simplex [Chap.4, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4980.pdf">14</a>].</p>



<p>What do we learn from this reformulation? </p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>We can prove (by similar means) that if the data set is linearly separable then \(\Vert r(t)\Vert_2^2\) diverges. So the sequence of functions \(F_{\Vert r\Vert_2^2}\) converges to the margin \(F_\infty\) which means that \(\bar a(t)\) just ends up optimizing the function \(F_\infty\). As a consequence, we have $$\lim_{t\to \infty} y_i x_i^\top \bar a(t) = \max_{a\in \Delta_d} \min_{i} y_i x_i^\top a.$$ This exposes another implicit bias of gradient flow. Notice the key difference with the implicit bias obtained with a linear parameterization: we obtain here the \(\ell_1\)-max-margin (over classifiers with non-negative entries) instead of the \(\ell_2\)-max-margin.  </li><li>Beyond exposing the implicit bias, this reformulation shows that \(\bar a(t)\) implicitly optimizes a sequence of smooth objectives which converge to the margin \(F_\infty\). Unknowingly, we have recovered the well-principled optimization method that consists in approximating a non-smooth objective with smooth functions [<a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~sqma/MAT258A_Files/Nesterov-2005.pdf">15</a>].</li><li>While the conclusion above was only formal, this point of view leads to rigorous proofs of convergence and convergence rates in discrete time in \(\tilde O(1/\sqrt{t})\) with a step-size in \(O(1/\sqrt{t})\), by  exploiting tools from online optimization, see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04486.pdf">1</a>].</li></ul>



<h2>5. Implicit bias: fully trained 2-layer neural networks</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Once again this argument about linear predictors applies to neural networks: if we train both layers but only the magnitude of the hidden weights and not their direction, then this is equivalent to learning a 2-homogeneous linear model on top of the random feature \([  a_j(0) (x_i^\top b_j(0))_+]_{j=1}^m\). If each feature appears twice with opposite signs — which is essentially the case in the large width limit — then the simplex constraint can be equivalently replaced by an \(\ell_1\)-norm constraint on the weights. Recalling the definition of the \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-norm from Eq. (4), we thus obtain that, in the infinite-width limit, the normalized predictor converges to a solution to $$ \max_{\Vert h\Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1} \leq 1} \min_i y_i h(x_i).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">This result is correct, but it is not relevant. In contrast to functions in \(\mathcal{F}_2\), functions in \(\mathcal{F}_1\) <em>can not</em> in general be approximated with few <em>random</em> features in high dimension. In fact, lower bounds that are exponential in the dimension exist in certain settings [Sec. X, <a href="http://www.stat.yale.edu/~arb4/publications_files/UniversalApproximationBoundsForSuperpositionsOfASigmoidalFunction.pdf">16</a>]. They can be approximated with a small number of features but those need to be data-dependent: in that sense, it is necessary to learn a representation – here,  a distribution over the hidden weights — in order to learn in \(\mathcal{F}_1\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">This raises the following question: do we obtain the same implicit bias when training both layers of the neural network, without fixing the direction of the input weights? In the following result, which is the main theorem of our paper [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04486">1</a>], we answer by the affirmative.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Theorem</strong> (C. and Bach [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04486">1</a>], informal). Assume that for some \(\sigma&gt;0\), the hidden weights \(b_j\) are initialized uniformly on the sphere of radius \(\sigma\) and the output weights \(a_j\) are uniform in \(\{-\sigma,\sigma\}\). Let \(\mu_t\) be the Wasserstein gradient flow for the unregularized exponential loss and \(h_t = \int \Phi(w)d\mu_t(w)\) be the corresponding dynamics in predictor space. Under some technical assumptions, the normalized predictor \(h_t/\Vert h_t\Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1}\) converges to a solution to the \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-max-margin problem: $$\max_{\Vert h\Vert_{\mathcal{F}_1} \leq 1} \min_i y_i h(x_i).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">Giving an idea of proof would be a bit too technical for this blog post, but let us make some remarks:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>The strength of this result is that although this dynamics could get trapped towards limit directions which are not optimal, this choice of initialization allows to avoid them all and to only converge to <em>global</em> minimizers of this max-margin problem. The principle behind this is similar to the global convergence result in the previous blog post. </li><li>The fact that optimizing on the direction of the hidden weights is compatible with the global optimality conditions of the \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-max-margin problem is very specific to the structure of positively 2-homogeneous problems, and should not be taken for granted for other architectures of neural networks.</li><li>Although at a formal level this result works for any initialization that is diverse enough (such as the standard Gaussian initialization), the initialization proposed here yields dynamics with a better behavior for relu networks: by initializing the hidden and output weights with equal norms – a property preserved by the dynamics – we avoid some instabilities in the gradient. Also notice that this result applies to any scale \(\sigma&gt;0\) of the initialization (we’ll see an intriguing consequence of this in the next section).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Illustration.</strong> In the figure below, we plot the training dynamics when both layers are trained. In parameter space (left), each particle represents a neuron: its position is \(\vert a_j\vert b_j\) and its color depends on the sign of \(a_j\).  Here again the unit sphere is at infinity. The inactive neurons at the bottom correspond to those with a bias that is “too negative” at initialization. We observe that all the other neurons gather into few clusters: this is the sparsifying effect of the \(L^1\)-norm in Eq. (4). In predictor space, we obtain a polygonal classifier, as expected for a \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-max-margin classifier. See the paper [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04486.pdf">1</a>] for experiments that illustrate the strengths of this classifier in terms of generalization.</p>

<h2>6. Lazy regime and the neural tangent kernel</h2>



<p class="justify-text">This blog post would not be complete without mentioning the <em>lazy regime</em>. This is yet another kind of implicit bias which, in our context, takes place when at initialization the weights have a large magnitude and the step-size is small. It was first exhibited in [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8076-neural-tangent-kernel-convergence-and-generalization-in-neural-networks.pdf">17</a>] for deep neural networks (see also [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.02054.pdf">18</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.03962.pdf">19</a>]). Hereafter, we follow the presentation of [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.07956.pdf">20</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Lazy training via scaling.</strong> This phenomenon is in fact very general so let us present it with a generic parametric predictor \(h(W)\) with differential \(Dh(W)\). We introduce a scaling factor \(\alpha&gt;0\) and look at the gradient flow of \(F(W) := R(\alpha h(W))\) with a step-size \(1/\alpha^2\), that is $$ W'(t) = \ – \frac{1}{\alpha}Dh(W(t))^\top \nabla R(\alpha h(W(t))),$$ with initialization \(W(0)\). In terms of the predictor \(\alpha h(W)\), this yields the dynamics $$\frac{d}{dt} \alpha h(W(t)) = \ – Dh(W(t))Dh(W(t))^\top \nabla R(\alpha h(W(t)).$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">Lazy training happens when we take \(\alpha\) large while making sure that \(\alpha h(W(0))\) stays bounded. In this case, we see that the parameters change at a rate \(O(1/\alpha)\), while the predictor changes at a rate independent of \(\alpha\). On any bounded time interval, in the limit of  a large \(\alpha\), the parameters only move infinitesimally, while the predictor still makes significant progress, hence the name <em>lazy training</em>.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Equivalent linear model.</strong> Since the parameters hardly move, if we assume that \(Dh(W(0))\neq 0\) then we can replace the map \(h\) by its linearization \(W \mapsto h(W(0))+Dh(W(0))(W-W(0))\). This means that the training dynamics essentially follows the gradient flow of the  objective $$ R\big ( \alpha h(W(0)) + \alpha Dh(W(0))(W-W(0)) \big)$$ which is a convex function of \(W\) as soon as \(R\) is convex.</p>



<p class="justify-text">If this objective admits a minimizer that is not too far away from \(W(0)\), then \(W(t)\) converges to this minimizer. If in contrast all  the minimizers are too far away (think of the exponential loss where they are at infinity), then the parameters will eventually move significantly and the lazy regime is just a transient regime in the early phase of training.  Of course, all these behaviors can be quantified and made more precise, because this phenomenon brings us back to the realm of linear models. </p>



<p class="justify-text">What all of this has to do with two-layer neural networks? As it happens, this scale factor appears implicit in various situations for these models; let us detail two of them. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Neural networks with \(1/\sqrt{m}\) scaling.</strong> For two-layer neural networks, lazy training occurs if we define \(h = \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}} \sum_{j=1}^m \Phi(w_j)\) instead of \(h=\frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=1}^m \Phi(w_j)\) before taking the infinite width limit. Indeed:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>This induces a scaling factor \(\alpha = \sqrt{m} \to \infty\) compared to \(1/m\) which, as we have already seen, is the “correct” scaling that leads to a non-degenerate dynamics in parameter space as \(m\) increases. </li><li>Moreover, by the central limit theorem,  \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}} \sum_{j=1}^m \Phi(w_j(0)) = O(1)\) for typical random initializations of the parameters. So the initial predictor stays bounded.</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">To take the Wasserstein gradient flow limit, the step-size has to be of order \(m\) (see previous blog post). So here we should take a step-size of order \(m/\alpha^2 = 1\). With such a step-size, all the conditions for lazy training are gathered when \(m\) is large. Intuitively, each neuron only moves infinitesimally, but they collectively produce a significant movement in predictor space.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Neural networks with large initialization.</strong> Coming back to our scaling in \(1/m\) and our Wasserstein gradient flow that is obtained in the large width limit, there is another way to enter the lazy regime: by increasing the variance of the initialization. </p>



<p class="justify-text">To see this, assume that \(h\) is a positively \(p\)-homogeneous parametric predictor, which means that \(h(\sigma W)=\sigma^p h(W)\) for all \(\sigma&gt;0\) and some \(p&gt;1\) (remember that this is true with \(p=2\) for our two-layer relu neural network). Take an initialization of the form \(W(0) = \sigma \bar W_0\) where \(\sigma&gt;0\) and \(h(\bar W_0)=0\) (which is also satisfied for our infinite width neural networks with the initialization considered previously). Consider the gradient flow of \(R(h(W))\) with step-size \(\sigma^{2-2p}\).   By defining \(\bar W(t) = W(t)/\sigma\) and using the fact that the differential of a p-homogeneous function <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_function#Positive_homogeneity">is (p-1)-homogeneous</a>, we have, on the one hand $$ \bar W'(t) = -\sigma^{-p} Dh(\bar W(t))^\top \nabla R(\sigma^p h(\bar W(t))), $$ and on the other hand $$\frac{d}{dt} \sigma^p h(\bar W(t)) =\  – Dh(\bar W(t))Dh(\bar W(t))^\top \nabla R(\sigma^p h(\bar W(t))).$$ So in terms of the dynamics \(\bar W(t)\), the situation is exactly equivalent to having a scaling factor \(\alpha=\sigma^p\). This implies that as the magnitude \(\sigma\) of the initialization increases, we enter the lazy regime, provided the step-size is of order \(\sigma^{2-2p}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Neural tangent kernel. </strong>What does the lazy regime tell us about the learnt predictor for two-layer neural networks? Assuming for simplicity that the predictor at initialization is \(0\), this regime amounts to learning a linear model on top of the feature \([(b_j^\top x)_+]_{j=1}^m\) — the derivative with respect to the output weights — concatenated with the feature \([x a_j 1_{b_j^\top x &gt; 0} ]_{j=1}^m\)  — the derivative with respect to the input weights. Compared to training only the output layer, this thus simply adds some features. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Assume for concreteness, that at initialization the hidden weights \(b_j\) are uniform on a sphere of large radius \(\sigma&gt;0\) and the output weights are uniform on \(\{-\kappa\sigma, \kappa\sigma\}\) where \(\kappa\geq 0\). For a large width and a large \(\sigma\), we enter the lazy regime which amounts to learning in a RKHS — let us call it \(\mathcal{F}_{2,\kappa}\) — that is slightly different from \(\mathcal{F}_2 = \mathcal{F}_{2,0}\), since its kernel \(K_\kappa\) contains another term: $$ K_\kappa(x,x’) = \int_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} (\theta^\top x)_+ (\theta^\top x’)_+d\tau(\theta) + \kappa^2 \int_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} (x^\top x’) 1_{\theta^\top x &gt; 0}1_{\theta^\top x’ &gt; 0}d\tau(\theta). $$</p>



<p class="justify-text">This kernel is called the Neural Tangent Kernel [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8076-neural-tangent-kernel-convergence-and-generalization-in-neural-networks.pdf">17</a>] and the properties of the associated RKHS have been studied in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12191.pdf">21</a>, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/9449-on-the-inductive-bias-of-neural-tangent-kernels.pdf">22</a>], where it is shown to include functions that are slightly less smooth than those of \(\mathcal{F}_2\) when \(\kappa\) increases. This is illustrated in the plot below, obtained by training a wide neural network with \(\sigma\) large (to reach the lazy regime) on the square loss, and various values of \(\kappa\).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="574" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/interp-4.png" class="wp-image-4213" height="287" />1-D regression with a wide two-layer relu neural network (gradient descent on square loss, in the lazy regime) with 4 training samples (black dots). At initialization, output weights have \(\kappa\) times the (large) magnitude of the hidden weights. This implicitly solves kernel ridgeless regression for a kernel that depends on \(\kappa\). <a href="https://github.com/lchizat/2020_implicitbias_blog/blob/master/exp_NTK.jl">[code]</a></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Two implicit biases in one shot.</strong> The attentive reader might have noticed that for large initialization scale \(\sigma\gg 1\), when training both layers on the unregularized exponential loss, two of our analyses apply:  lazy training — that leads to a max-margin predictor in \(\mathcal{F}_{2,\kappa}\) — and the asymptotic implicit bias — that leads to a max-margin predictor in \(\mathcal{F}_{1}\).  So, where is the catch? </p>



<p class="justify-text">There is none! Since the minimizers of this loss are at infinity, the lazy regime is just a transient phase and we will observe both implicit biases along the training dynamics! Take a look at the video below: we observe that in early phases of training, the neurons do not move while learning a smooth classifier — this is the lazy regime and the classifier approaches the \(\mathcal{F}_{2,\kappa}\)-max-margin classifier. In later stages of training, the neurons start moving and the predictor converges to a \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-max-margin classifier as stated by the main theorem. The predictor jitters a little bit during training because I have chosen rather aggressive step-sizes. As shown in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.06738.pdf">23</a>], the transition between these two implicit biases can be well understood in some simpler models.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="640" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/film_lazy2sparse_ns_comp-1.gif" class="wp-image-4219" height="316" />Training both layers with gradient descent for the unregularized exponential loss. The only difference with the previous video is that at initialization the variance \(\sigma^2\) is larger and the step-size smaller \(\approx \sigma^{-2}\). First the network learns a classifier in the lazy regime (a kernel max-margin classifier) and eventually converges to the \(\mathcal{F}_1\)-max-margin classifier. [<a href="https://github.com/lchizat/2020_implicitbias_blog/blob/master/exp_lazy2adaptive.jl">code</a>]</figure></div>



<h2>Discussion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I described how analyses of the training dynamics can help us understand the properties of the predictor learnt by neural networks even in the absence of an explicit regularization. Already for the simplest algorithm one can think of — gradient descent — we have found a variety of behaviors depending on the loss, the initialization or the step-size. </p>



<p class="justify-text">To achieve this description, the infinite width limit is of great help. It allows to obtain synthetic and precise characterizations of the learnt predictor, that can be used to derive generalization bounds. Yet, there are many interesting non-asymptotic effects caused by having a finite width.  In that sense, we were only concerned with the end of the curve of double descent [<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/32/15849.full.pdf">24</a>].</p>

<h3>Lower bound on the gradient norm for linear classification with the exponential loss</h3>



<p class="justify-text">In the context of Section 2, we want to prove that \(\Vert \nabla F(a)\Vert_2\geq \gamma\). For this, let \(Z\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}\) be the matrix with rows \(y_i x_i\) and let \(\Delta_n\) be the simplex in \(\mathbb{R}^n\). We have by duality $$ \gamma = \max_{\Vert a\Vert_2\leq 1}\min_{p\in \Delta_n} p^\top Z a =   \min_{p\in \Delta_n} \max_{\Vert a\Vert_2\leq 1} a^\top Z^\top p = \min_{p\in \Delta_n} \Vert Z^\top p\Vert_2 .$$  Also, notice that \(\nabla F(a) = Z^\top p\) with \(p_i = \frac{e^{-y_ix_i^\top a}}{\sum_{j=1}^n e^{-y_{j}x_{j}^\top a}}\). Since \(p \in \Delta_n\), we conclude that \(\Vert \nabla F(a)\Vert_2\geq \min_{p\in \Delta_n} \Vert Z^\top p\Vert_2 = \gamma\).</p></div>

<p>I originally planned this summer to finish the work on my <a href="https://introtcs.org/">Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science</a> book, and in particular write the two missing chapters on space complexity and interactive proof systems. Needless to say, this summer did not go as planned and I won’t be able to write these chapters. However, I still intend to go over the existing chapters, fixing typos, adding examples, exercises, and generally making it friendlier to beginning undergraduate students. </p>



<p>Toward this end, I would be grateful for people posting bugs, typos, and suggestions as <a href="https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/issues">GitHub issues</a> (I currently have 267 closed and 14 open issues which I hope to get to soon). Of course, if you are technically inclined and there’s a simple local fix, you can also make  a <a href="https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/pulls">pull request</a>.</p>



<p>Aside from these fixes, I am making two more “global” changes to the book. First, I am adding a “non mathy overview” for each chapter. While some students got a lot from reading the book prior to lectures, others were intimidated by the mathematical notation, and so I hope this more gentle introduction will be helpful. I am also adding more examples &amp; solved exercises toward this end. </p>



<p>Another change is that I now follow the more traditional way of presenting deterministic finite automata <em>before </em>Turing machines – DFAs are still optional and can be skipped without missing anything, but some instructors find them as a good introduction to Turing Machines. Thus the order of presentation of materials in the book is roughly as follows:<br /></p>



<ol><li><strong>Introduction, representing objects as strings</strong> –  Representing numbers, lists, etc. Specifying computational tasks as functions mapping binary strings to binary strings,  Cantor’s theorem.</li><li><strong>Finite functions and Boolean circuits</strong> – Every function can be computed by some circuit, circuits as straightline programs, representing circuits as strings, universal circuit evaluator, counting lower bound.</li><li><strong>Computing on unbounded inputs</strong> – DFAs (optional), Turing Machines, equivalence between Turing machines, RAM machines and programming languages, λ calculus (optional), cellular automata (optional)</li><li><strong>Uncomputability</strong> – Universal Turing machine, Halting problem, reductions, Rice’s Theorem. Optional: Gödel’s incompleteness theorem, uncomputability of quantified arithmetic statements, context free grammars.</li><li><strong>Efficient computation</strong> – Modeling running time, time hierarchy theorem,  <strong>P</strong> and <strong>EXP</strong></li><li><strong>NP and NP completeness</strong> – Polynomial-time reductions, Cook-Levin Theorem (using circuits), definition of <strong>NP</strong> using “proof system”/”verifying algorithms” (no non-deterministic TMs), <strong>NP</strong> completeness, consequences of <strong>P</strong>=<strong>NP</strong>: search to decision, optimal machine learning, etc..</li><li><strong>Randomized computation:</strong> Worst-case randomized computation, defining <strong>BPP</strong>,  Sipser-Gács, does <strong>BPP</strong>=<strong>P</strong>? (a little on derandomization)</li><li><strong>Cryptography:</strong> One time pad, necessity of long keys for information theoretic crypto,  pseudorandom generators and stream ciphers, taste of public key and “magic” (ZKP, FHE, MPC)</li><li><strong>Quantum computing:</strong> Some quantum mechanics background – double slit experiment,  Bell’s inequality. Modeling quantum computation. Bird’s eye view of Shor’s algorithm and quantum Fourier transform.</li></ol>

<p>Going directly from undergraduate to Ph.D can be a good idea for many students interested in research, but it’s not the only route or the best choice for everyone.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2018/02/20/research-masters/">I wrote before</a>, for students that discovered their interest in theoretical CS late in their undergrad, or perhaps after they graduated, a research Masters, can be a great option. This is particularly the case if the program is funded (i.e., students get a stipend and don’t need to pay tuition). Such programs are not common in the U.S., but there are some excellent choices around the world.</p>



<p>Since (as far as I know) there is no single source listing such programs, I thought a crowdsourced Google spreadsheet might be useful and so created one here: <a href="http://tiny.cc/tcsmasters" rel="nofollow">http://tiny.cc/tcsmasters</a></p>

<p>Dear fellow theorists,</p>



<p>As you already know, STOC 2020 this year will be a virtual conference. If you are interested in attending the conference, but haven’t registered yet, <a href="http://www.cvent.com/events/52nd-annual-acm-symposium-on-theory-of-computing-stoc-2020-/event-summary-ea5fa7861d1a476d82bc10f667a1c0f4.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">please do so soon</a> (students: $25, regular: $50). This will help us ensure we have capacity for various online events. </p>



<p>Upon registration, you should receive a confirmation email from CVENT, also containing access information for various conference events. Also, if you are a student looking to register for STOC but the cost is a burden, please email us at <a>stoc2020@ttic.edu</a>.</p>



<p><strong>How will the conference work?</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Videos</strong>: The videos for all conference talks are now available on YouTube, and can be accessed through the links in the <a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2020/STOCprogram.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conference program</a>. Registration is <em>not required</em> to view the talks on Youtube.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Slack: The conference has a Slack workspace, with one channel for every paper and workshop, and additional channels for information, announcements, social events, help, etc. The invitations for the Slack workspace will be sent to registered participants. Authors are also encouraged to monitor the channels for their papers. All access information for the conference will also be available here. The workspace is currently active, and will remain active for at least one week after the conference.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Zoom sessions</strong>: The conference will feature Zoom sessions with short presentations by the speakers. The total time for each paper is 10 minutes. Given that participants have access to the full talks by the speakers on Youtube, these can be thought of as being analogues of poster sessions. The workshops will also be held as separate sessions. The links for the Zoom sessions are available via information in the registration confirmation email.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Social events</strong>: The conference will include junior/senior “lunches”, breakout tables for impromptu and scheduled hangouts, and a group event using <a href="https://gather.town/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gather.town</a>. The timings for the events can be found in the conference program. Sign-up links for various events will be sent to all registered participants – please do sign-up soon!</li></ul>

<p><em>[From Jelani Nelson and David Woodruff. This workshop can be very important to ensure TCS is represented in what is likely to be a difficult funding environment in coming years. –Boaz ]</em> </p>



<p>The <a href="https://thmatters.wordpress.com/catcs/">CATCS</a> will be hosting a virtual <strong>“Visioning Workshop”</strong> the <strong>week of </strong><strong>July 20</strong> in order to identify broad research themes within theoretical computer science (TCS) that have potential for a major impact in the future. The goals are similar to the <a href="https://thmatters.wordpress.com/visioning-workshop/">workshop of the same name</a> in 2008: to package these themes in a way that can be consumed by the general public, which we would deliver primarily to the Computing Community Consortium and others (e.g. funding agencies) to help them advocate for TCS.</p>



<p>While participation in the workshop is primarily through invitation, we have a few slots available for the broader community. If you are interested in participating, please see details of the application process below. The workshop will be organized according to area-wise breakout groups. Each breakout group will have 1-2 leads. Breakout groups will meet for 4-5 hours spread across several days and will be tasked with brainstorming ideas and preparing materials related to their topic. Leads are further expected to participate in plenary sessions held on Monday July 20 and Friday July 24 (4-5 hrs of additional time) where these materials will be discussed.</p>



<p>If you are interested in participating in the workshop, please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/cdCTsLfUs56CDhKS9">this Google form</a> by <strong>Monday June 15</strong> ( <a href="https://forms.gle/cdCTsLfUs56CDhKS9">https://forms.gle/cdCTsLfUs56CDhKS9</a> ). On this form, applicants are asked to contribute one or two major results in the last 10 years whose significance can be explained in layperson terms, and one or two major challenges for theory whose significance can be explained in layperson terms. <em>[The results need not and generally will not be your own. They just should be easy-to-explain major results in your research area–Boaz] </em>These descriptions can be very brief. We will just use them to select participants and create breakout groups.</p></div>

<p>The<a href="https://itcrypto.github.io/2020main.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> ITC 2020 program</a> is out, and this newborn looks healthy and strong! The program contains exciting new works in the area of Information-Theoretic Cryptography, confirming the importance of this new venue. </p>



<p>The PC, chaired by Daniel Wichs, also chose an amazing sequence of invited talks by Dachman-Soled, Natarajan, Jafar, Kol, Raz, and Vaikuntanathan, so this can also be a good opportunity to hear about the big recent developments in the area.</p>



<p><br />The conference will be virtual this year. Participation is free but requires registration. We hope to see many of you there</p>

<p class="justify-text">Supervised learning methods come in a variety of flavors. While local averaging techniques such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm">nearest-neighbors</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning">decision trees</a> are often used with low-dimensional inputs where they can adapt to any potentially non-linear relationship between inputs and outputs, methods based on empirical risk minimization are the most commonly used in high-dimensional settings. Their principle is simple: optimize the (potentially regularized) risk on training data over prediction functions in a pre-defined set of functions.</p>



<p class="justify-text">When the set of a functions is a convex subset of a vector space with a finite-dimensional representation, with standard assumptions, the corresponding optimization problem is convex. This has the benefits of allowing a thorough theoretical understanding of the computational and statistical properties of learning methods, which often come with strong theoretical guarantees, in terms of running time [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4980">1</a>, <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/16M1080173">2</a>, <a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/bach_jenatton_mairal_obozinski_FOT.pdf">3</a>] or prediction performance on unseen data [<a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf">4</a>, <a href="http://static.stevereads.com/papers_to_read/all_of_statistics.pdf">5</a>]. In particular, the linear parameterization can be done either explicitly by building a typically large finite set of features, or implicitly through the use of kernel methods and then a series of dedicated algorithms and theories can be leveraged for efficient non-linear predictions [6, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3182-random-features-for-large-scale-kernel-machines.pdf">7</a>, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6978-falkon-an-optimal-large-scale-kernel-method.pdf">8</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">However, linearly-parameterized sets of functions do not include neural networks, which lead to state-of-the-art performance in most learning tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, speech processing, in particular through the use of deep and convolutional neural networks [<a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/">9</a>].</p>



<h2>Two-layer neural networks with “relu” activations</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The goal of this blog post is to provide some understanding of why supervised machine learning work for the simplest form of such models: $$ h(x) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m a_i ( b_i^\top x)_+ = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m a_i \max\{ b_i^\top x,0\},$$ where the input \(x\) is a vector in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), and \(m\) is the number of hidden neurons. The weights \(a_i \in \mathbb{R}\), \(i=1,\dots,n\), are the <em>output weights</em>, while the weights \(b_i \in \mathbb{R}^d\), \(i=1,\dots,n\), are the <em>input weights</em>. The rectified linear unit (“relu”) [<a href="http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v15/glorot11a/glorot11a.pdf">10</a>] activation is used, and our results will depend heavily on its positive homogeneity (that is, for \(\lambda &gt; 0\), \((\lambda u)_+ = \lambda u_+\)).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="407" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/nn_single_blog.png" class="wp-image-3829" height="292" />Two-layer neural network in dimension \(d = 6\) with \(m=4\) hidden neurons, and a single output.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Note that this is an idealized and much simplified set-up for deep learning, as there is a single hidden-layer, no convolutions, no pooling, etc. As I will show below, this simple set-up is already complex to understand, and I believe it captures some of the core difficulties associated with non-convexity.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The first question that one may come to after decades of research in learning theory is: <em>why is it so hard to analyze?</em>  </p>



<p class="justify-text">There are at least two major difficulties:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Non-linearity</strong>: the dependence on the input weights \(b_i\)’s is non-linear because of the activation function, typically leading to non-convex optimization problems.</li><li><strong>Overparameterization</strong>: The number \(m\) of hidden neurons is very large (often so large that the number of parameters \(m(d+1)\) exceeds the number of observations), which is hard in terms of optimization and potentially generalization to unseen data. </li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, we will leverage the overparameterization and take \(m\) tending to infinity (without any dependence on the number of observations), which will allow us to derive theoretical results. We will leverage two key properties of the problem:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Separability</strong> of the model in \(w_i = (a_i,b_i)\), that is, the prediction function \(h(x)\) is the sum of terms which are independently parameterized, as \(h = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \Phi(w_i)\), where \(\Phi: \mathbb{R}^p \to \mathcal{F}\), with \(\mathcal{F}\) a space of functions. In our situation, \(p = d+1\) and: $$ \Phi(w)(x) = a (b^\top x)_+. $$ In other words,  there is no parameter sharing among hidden neurons. Unfortunately, this does not generalize to more than a single hidden layer.</li><li><strong>Homogeneity</strong>: the relu activation is positively homogeneous so that as as function of \(w = (a,b) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^d\), \(\Phi(w)(x) = a (b^\top x)_+\) is positively 2-homogeneous, that is, \(\Phi(\lambda w) = \lambda^2 \Phi(w)\) for \(\lambda &gt; 0\).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">In this sequence of two blog posts, following a recent trend in optimization and machine learning theory [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4900-non-strongly-convex-smooth-stochastic-approximation-with-convergence-rate-o1n.pdf">11</a>, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/32/15849.full.pdf">12</a>], optimization and statistics cannot be separated and need to be tackled together. I will focus on gradient flows on empirical or expected risks.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I will cover optimization and how over-parameterization leads to global convergence for 2-homogeneous models, a recent result obtained two years ago with <a href="https://lchizat.github.io/">Lénaïc Chizat</a> [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7567-on-the-global-convergence-of-gradient-descent-for-over-parameterized-models-using-optimal-transport.pdf">13</a>]. This requires tools from optimal transport which I will briefly describe (for more details, see, e.g., [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00567">14</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Next month, I will focus on generalization capabilities and the several implicit biases associated with gradient descent in this context [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8559-on-lazy-training-in-differentiable-programming.pdf">15</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04486">16</a>].</p>



<h2>Infinitely wide limit and probability measures</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Following the standard learning set-up, our goal will be to minimize with respect to the prediction function \(h\) the functional \(R\) defined as $$ R(h) = \mathbb{E}_{p(x,y)} \big[ \ell( y, h(x) ) \big],$$ where \(\ell(y,h(x))\) is the loss incurred by outputting \(h(x)\) when \(y\) is the true label. Even within deep learning, this loss is most often convex in its second argument, such as for least-squares or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_functions_for_classification">logistic</a> losses. Thus, I will assume that \(R\) is convex.</p>



<p>The expectation can be considered in two scenarios:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Empirical risk</strong>: this corresponds to the situation where we have observations \((x_j,y_j)\), \(j=1,\dots,n\), coming from some joint distribution on \((x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}\). Minimizing \(R\) then may not lead to any guarantee on unseen data unless some explicit or implicit regularization is used. In next blog post, I will consider the implicit regularization effect of gradient-based algorithms.</li><li><strong>Expected risk (or generalization performance)</strong>: The expectation is taken with respect to unseen data, and thus its value (or a gradient) cannot be computed. However, any training observation \((x_j,y_j)\) can lead to an unbiased estimate, and if single pass stochastic gradient is used, our guarantees will be on the expected risk.</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">The main and very classical idea is to consider the minimization of $$ G(W) = G(w_1,\dots,w_m) = R \Big( \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \Phi(w_i) \Big),$$ and see it as the minimization of $$ F(\mu) = R \Big( \int_{\mathbb{R}^p} \Phi(w) d\mu(w) \Big),$$ with respect to a probability measure \(\mu\), with the equivalence for $$ \mu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \delta(w_i),$$ where \(\delta(w_i)\) is the Dirac measure at \(w_i\). See an illustration below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="615" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/diracs_measures-1-1024x156.png" class="wp-image-3852" height="93" />Left: discrete probability measure. Right: measure with density.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">When \(m\) is large, we can represent any measure in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_of_measures#Weak_convergence_of_measures">weak sense</a> (that is, expectations of any continuous and bounded functions can be approximated). The benefits of considering the space of all measures instead of discrete measures have been used already in variety of contexts in machine learning, statistics and signal processing [<a href="http://www.stat.yale.edu/~arb4/publications_files/UniversalApproximationBoundsForSuperpositionsOfASigmoidalFunction.pdf">17</a>, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/2800-convex-neural-networks.pdf">18</a>, <a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/14-546/14-546.pdf">19</a>]. In this blog post, the key benefit is that the set of measures in convex and \(h = \int_{\mathbb{R}^p} \Phi(w) d\mu(w) \) is linear in the measure \(\mu\), so that our optimization problem has become convex.</p>



<p class="justify-text">However, (1) It does not buy much in practice, as the set of probability measures is infinite-dimensional. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank–Wolfe_algorithm">Frank-Wolfe algorithms</a> can be used, but the choice of new neurons is a difficult optimization problem, NP-hard for the threshold activation function [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/070685798">20</a>], with polynomial potentially high complexity for the relu activation [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v65/goel17a/goel17a.pdf">21</a>], and (2) this is not what is used in practice, which is (stochastic) gradient descent.</p>



<h2>Finite-dimensional gradient flow</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I will consider the gradient flow $$\dot{W} = \ – m \nabla G(W),$$ (where \(m\) is added as a normalization factor to allow a well-defined limit when \(m\) tends to infinity). This is still not exactly what is used in practice, but, as explained in <a href="https://francisbach.com/gradient-flows/">last month post</a>, this is a good approximation of gradient descent (if using the empirical risk, then leading to guarantees of global convergence on the empirical risk only), or stochastic gradient descent (if doing a single pass on the data, then leading to guarantees of global convergence on unseen data). This is a non-convex dynamics, with stationary points and local minima, even when \(m\) is large (see, e.g., [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/safran18a/safran18a.pdf">27</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Two main questions arise: (1) what does the gradient flow dynamics converge to when the number of neurons \(m\) tends to infinity, and (2) can we get any global convergence guarantees for the limiting dynamics?</p>



<h2>Mean-field limit and Wasserstein gradient flows</h2>



<p class="justify-text">When \(m\) tends to infinity, since we want to use the measure representation, we need to understand the effect of performing the gradient flow jointly on \(w_1,\dots,w_m\) on the measure $$ \mu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \delta(w_i),$$ and see if we can take a limit when \(m\) tends to infinity. This process of taking limits is common in physics and often referred to as the “mean-field” limit, and has been considered in a series of recent works [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05438">22</a>, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7567-on-the-global-convergence-of-gradient-descent-for-over-parameterized-models-using-optimal-transport.pdf">13</a>, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/33/E7665.full.pdf">23</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00915">24</a>]. To avoid too much technicality, I will assume that the map \(\Phi\) is sufficiently differentiable, which unfortunately exclude the relu activation; for dedicated results, see [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7567-on-the-global-convergence-of-gradient-descent-for-over-parameterized-models-using-optimal-transport.pdf">13</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Gradient flows on metric spaces.</strong> In order to understand the dynamics in the space of probability measures, we need to take a step backward and realize that gradient flows can be defined for many functions \(f\) on any metric space \(\mathcal{X}\). Indeed, it can be seen as the limit of taking infinitesimal steps of length \(\gamma\), where each new iterate \(x_{k+1}\) (corresponding to the value at time \(k\gamma\)) is defined recursively from \(x_k\) as $$x_{k+1} \in \arg\min_{x \in \mathcal{X}}\  f(x) + \frac{1}{2\gamma} d(x,x_k)^2.$$ As shown in [<a href="http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~sayan/ambrosio.pdf">25</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13373-017-0101-1.pdf">26</a>], with some form of interpolation, this defines a curve with prescribed values \(x_k\) at each \(\gamma k\), and when the step-size \(\gamma\) goes to zero, this curves “converges” to the gradient flow.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="419" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/euler-1024x520.png" class="wp-image-3960" height="212" />Gradient flow in bold black, with interpolating curve in red from 14 points \(x_0,\dots,x_{13}\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">For the space \(\mathcal{X} = \mathbb{R}^d\) with the Euclidean distance and a continuously differentiable function \(f\), we obtain that $$x_{k+1} = x_k – \gamma f'(x_k) + o(\gamma),$$ and we get the usual gradient flow associated to \(f\), and the scheme above is nothing less than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">Euler discretization</a> that was described <a href="https://francisbach.com/gradient-flows/">last month</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Vector space gradient flows on probability measures.</strong> Probability measures are a convex subset of measures with finite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_variation#Total_variation_of_probability_measures">total variation</a>, which is equal to the \(\ell_1\)-norm between densities when the two probability measures have densities with respect to the same base measure. It is a normed vector space for which we could derive our first type of gradient flow, which can be seen as a continuous version of Frank-Wolfe algorithm, where atoms are added one by one, until convergence.  </p>



<p class="justify-text">As mentioned above, the fact that atoms are created sequentially seems attractive computationally. However, (1) deciding which one to add is a computationally hard problem, and (2) the flow on measures cannot be approximated by a finite evolving set of “particles” (here hidden neurons each defined by a vector \(w \in \mathbb{R}^{d+1}\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Wasserstein gradient flows on probability measures.</strong> There is another natural distance here, namely the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasserstein_metric">Wasserstein distance</a> (sometimes called the Kantorovich–Rubinstein distance). In order to remain short, I will only define it between empirical measures $$\mu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \delta(w_i) \mbox{ and } \nu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \delta(v_i)$$ with the same number of points. The squared 2-Wasserstein distance is obtained by minimizing $$\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \| w_j – v_{\sigma(j)} \|_2^2$$ over all permutations \(\sigma: \{1,\dots,m\} \to \{1,\dots,m\}\). See illustration below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="573" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Wasserstein-2-1024x307.png" class="wp-image-3886" height="171" />Wasserstein distance between two empirical measures: (left) original observations of two empirical measures with \(m = 11\) points, (right) assigning all black points to red points by minimizing the sum of squared distances between assigned points.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">This can be extended to any pair of probability measures, and used within gradient flows, it has a very natural decoupling property: if \(\mu\) is fixed, and \(\nu\) is within a small distance of \(\mu\) in Wasserstein distance, then the optimal permutation above will always be the same, that is, locally, the Wasserstein distance is a sum of squared Euclidean distances. Then, the Wasserstein gradient flow will lead to \(m\) independent local regular Euclidean gradient flows, which interact through the gradient term as: $$ \dot{w}_i = \ –  \nabla \Phi(w_i)  \nabla R\Big(\int_{\mathbb{R}^p} \Phi d\mu \Big),$$ where the Jacobian \(\nabla \Phi(w_i)\) is a linear operator from \(\mathcal{F}\) to \(\mathbb{R}^p\), and \( \nabla R: \mathbb{R}^p \to \mathcal{F}\) the gradient operator of \(R\). Since \(\mu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \delta(w_i)\), the dynamics of each particle interacts through the gradient of \(R\). </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="456" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Wasserstein_flows-1024x508.png" class="wp-image-3890" height="225" />Gradient flow for \(m=7\) interacting particles.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">The intuitive reasoning above is behind the formal result for the function $$ F(\mu) = R \Big( \int_{\mathbb{R}^p} \Phi(w) d\mu(w) \Big),$$ that the limit of the Euclidean gradient flow on each particle when \(m\) tends to infinity, is exactly the Wasserstein gradient flow of \(F\). While I have proposed an intuitive explanation, this can be made more formal in particular through the use of partial differential equations on the density of the measure [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7567-on-the-global-convergence-of-gradient-descent-for-over-parameterized-models-using-optimal-transport.pdf">13</a>] (see also nice <a href="http://web.math.ucsb.edu/~kcraig/math/curriculum_vitae_files/NIPS_120917.pdf">slides</a> from Katy Craig on Wasserstein gradient flows).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Stationary points.</strong> Since \(R\) is assumed convex over the convex set of probability measures, all local minima of \(R\) are global, and we should expect the gradient flow to converge to global optimum from any initial measure. This is true for the gradient flow associated with the total variation metric. However this is not true for the Wasserstein gradient flow, for which stationary points which are not global minimizers exist (given that for discrete measures this corresponds to classical backpropagation, this is well known to anybody who has ever trained a neural network). Note that there exists a notion of convexity for Wasserstein gradient flows, namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_convexity">geodesic convexity</a>, but the function \(F\) is not geodesically convex in general.</p>



<h2>Global convergence</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We can now describe the main result from our recent work with Lénaïc [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7567-on-the-global-convergence-of-gradient-descent-for-over-parameterized-models-using-optimal-transport.pdf">13</a>]: under assumptions described below, for the function \(F\) defined above, if the Wasserstein gradient flow converges to a measure, this measure has to be a global minimum of \(F\) (note that we cannot prove it is always convergent).</p>



<p class="justify-text">On top of technical regularity assumptions that I will not describe here, we need two crucial broad assumptions:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Homogeneity</strong> of the function \(\Phi: \mathbb{R}^{d+1} \to \mathcal{F}\). We need a condition of this form, since if \(R\) is a linear function, then \(F(\mu)\) is of the form \(F(\mu) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^p} \psi(w)d\mu(w)\) with \(\psi(w) = R(\Phi(w))\), and the Wasserstein gradient flow will converge to a weighted some of Diracs at all local minimizers of \(\psi\), which is typically not a global minimizer.</li><li><strong>Initialization with positive mass in all directions</strong>. That is, \(w_i\)’s are uniformly distributed on the sphere or Gaussian, which is the de facto choice in practice. </li></ul>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Illustration</strong>. We illustrate the result above by considering \(R\) as the square loss and \(y\) being generated from \(x\) through a neural network with \(m_0=5\) neurons. When running the gradient flow above, as soon as \(m \geqslant 5\), the model is sufficiently flexible to attain zero loss, which is thus the global optimum of the cost function. However, the gradient flow may not reach it, as it gets trapped in a local optimum. Our theoretical result suggests that when \(m\) is large, we should converge to the original neurons, which we see below. The surprising (and still unexplained) phenomenon is that \(m\) does not need to be much larger than \(m_0\) to see practical global convergence.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="389" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ReLU_m5-1024x683.png" class="wp-image-3942" height="259" />Position of \(m = 5\) neurons, plotted as \(|a_i| b_i \in \mathbb{R}^2\) for a two-dimensional problem.

<h2>Discussion and open problems</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I described theoretical results showing the benefits of overparameterization: when the number of hidden neurons \(m\) tends to infinity, then the corresponding gradient flow converges to the global optimum of the cost function. The proof relies notably on homogeneity properties of the relu activation. </p>



<p class="justify-text">The main weakness of  this result is that is only <em>qualitative</em>: we cannot quantify how big \(m\) need to be to be close to the infinite width limit, or how fast the gradient flow converges to the global optimum. These are still open problems. Additional interesting areas of research are to extend these results to convolutional and/or deep networks.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Now that we know that we can obtain global convergence, I will describe next month the generalization properties when interpolating the training data with an overparameterized relu network [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04486">16</a>].</p>

<p>The fourth Foundations of Data Science virtual talk will take place on Friday, May 15th at 11:00 AM Pacific Time (2:00 pm Eastern Time, 20:00 Central European Time, 19:00 UTC).  <strong>Amin Karbasi </strong>from Yale University will speak about “<em>User-Friendly Submodular Maximization</em>”.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Submodular functions model the intuitive notion of diminishing returns. Due to their far-reaching applications, they have been rediscovered in many fields such as information theory, operations research, statistical physics, economics, and machine learning. They also enjoy computational tractability as they can be minimized exactly or maximized approximately.</p>



<p>The goal of this talk is simple. We see how a little bit of randomness, a little bit of greediness, and the right combination can lead to pretty good methods for offline, streaming, and distributed solutions. I do not assume any background on submodularity and try to explain all the required details during the talk.</p>

<p class="justify-text">Optimization algorithms often rely on simple intuitive principles, but their analysis quickly leads to a lot of algebra, where the original idea is not transparent. In last month <a href="https://francisbach.com/computer-aided-analyses/">post</a>, <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~ataylor/">Adrien Taylor</a> explained how convergence proofs could be automated. This month, I will show how proof sketches can be obtained easily for algorithms based on gradient descent. This will be done using vanishing step-sizes that lead to <em>gradient flows</em>.</p>



<h2>Gradient as local information</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The intuitive principle behind gradient descent is the quest for <em>local</em> descent. We thus need to characterize the local behavior of the function we aim to optimize. This is what gradients are for.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I will consider minimizing a function \(f\) over \(\mathbb{R}^d\). Assuming \(f\) is differentiable, a first order Taylor expansion of \(f\) around a point \(x\) leads to $$f(x+\delta) = f(x) + \nabla f(x) ^\top \delta + o(\| \delta\|),$$ for any norm \(\| \cdot \|\) on \(\mathbb{R}^d\), where \(\nabla f(x) \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is  the gradient of \(f\) at \(x\), composed of partial derivatives of \(f\). Therefore, around \(x\), \(f\) is approximately affine.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Since we have a local affine approximation around \(x\), we can look for the direction of steepest descent, that is, the unit norm vector \(u \in \mathbb{R}^d\) such that \(f\) decays the most along \(u\), that is such that $$  u^\top \nabla f(x)$$ is minimized. This steepest descent direction depends on the choice of norm (assuming that the gradient is not zero at \(x\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text">For the \(\ell_2\)-norm, then minimizing \(u^\top \nabla f(x)\) such that \(\|u\|_2 = 1\), leads to $$ \displaystyle u = \ – \frac{\nabla f(x)}{ \| \nabla f(x) \|_2},$$ that is the steepest descent is along the negative gradient (see an illustration below). In this blog post I will only focus on this steepest descent direction. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="428" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/gradient_contours-1024x358.png" class="wp-image-3542" height="149" />Function \(f\) represented through its contour lines for values 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Negative gradient \(– \nabla f(x)\) as the steepest descent direction at point \(x\), which is orthogonal to the contour lines.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">As as side note, for the \(\ell_1\)-norm, then minimizing \(u^\top \nabla f(x)\) such that \(\|u\|_1 = 1\), leads to $$u \in\  – \arg\max_{ v \in \{-e_1,\, e_1,\, -e_2,\, e_2,\dots,\, -e_d,\, e_d \}} v^\top \nabla f(x),$$ where \(e_i\) is the \(i\)-th canonical basis vector of \(\mathbb{R}^d\). Here the steepest descent is along a coordinate axis (along the positive or negative side), and this leads to various forms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_descent">coordinate descent</a> (this will probably be a topic for another post). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Given that the negative gradient leads to the steepest descent direction (for the Euclidean norm), it is natural to use this as a direction for an iterative algorithm, an idea that dates back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Louis_Cauchy">Cauchy</a> in 1847 [<a href="http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k90190w/f406">1</a>] (see the nice summary by Claude Le Maréchal [<a href="https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/documenta/vol-ismp/40_lemarechal-claude.pdf">2</a>]).</p>



<h2>From gradient descent to gradient flows</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">Gradient descent</a> is the most classical iterative algorithm to minimize differentiable functions. It takes the form $$x_{n+1} = x_{n} \, – \gamma \nabla f(x_{n})$$ at iteration \(n\), where \(\gamma &gt; 0 \) is a step-size.  </p>



<p class="justify-text">Gradient descent comes in many flavors, steepest, stochastic, pre-conditioned, conjugate, proximal, projected, accelerated, etc. There are lots of papers and books [e.g., 3, 4, 5] analyzing it in various settings.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, to simplify its analysis and setting the stage for later posts, I will present the gradient flow, which is essentially the limit of gradient descent when the step-size \(\gamma\) tends to zero.</p>



<p class="justify-text">More precisely, this is obtained by considering that our iterates \(x_n\) are sampled at each multiple of \(\gamma\), from a function \(X: \mathbb{R}_+ \to \mathbb{R}^d\), as $$x_n = X(n\gamma).$$ We can then use a piecewise affine interpolation to define a function defined on all points. We then have for \(t = n\gamma\), $$X(t + \gamma) = x_{n+1} =x_{n} \, – \gamma \nabla f(x_{n}) = X(t)\, – \gamma \nabla f(X(t)).$$ Dividing by \(\gamma\), we get $$ \frac{1}{\gamma} \big[ X(t + \gamma) \, – X(t) \big] = \, – \nabla f(X(t)).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">When \(\gamma\) tends to zero (and with simple additional regularity assumptions), the left hand side tends to the derivative of \(X\) at \(t\), and thus the function \(X\) tends to the solution of the following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation">ordinary differential equation</a> $$ \dot{X}(t) = \ – \nabla f (X(t)).$$ See an illustration below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img width="348" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/logistic_2d_flow.gif" class="wp-image-3479" height="271" />Gradient descent (with piece-wise affine interpolation between iterates) vs. gradient flow on the same time scale for a logistic regression problem.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Studying the gradient flow in lieu of the gradient descent recursions comes with pros and cons.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Simplified analyses</strong>. The gradient flow has no step-size, so all the traditional annoying issues regarding the choice of step-size, with line-search, constant, decreasing or with a weird schedule are unnecessary. Moreover, the use of differential calculus makes proving properties really simple (see examples below). We can thus focus on the essence of the algorithm rather than on technicalities.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>From (continuous) flow to actual (discrete) algorithms</strong>. A flow cannot be run on a computer as it is a continuous-time object. The traditional discretization is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">Euler method</a>, that exactly replaces the flow by a piecewise-affine interpolation of the gradient descent iterates, where as shown above, we see \(x_n\) as \(X(n\gamma)\), where \(\gamma\) is the time increment between two samples. Four interesting observations:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><em>No direct proof transfer</em> : While Euler discretization always provides an algorithm, the generic convergence proofs do not allow to transfer immediately continuous-time proofs to convergence results for the discrete analysis. A key difficulty is to set-up the step-size \(\gamma\). However, the analysis can often be mimicked, i.e., similar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_function">Lyapunov functions</a> can be used (see examples below).</li><li><em>Proximal algorithms</em> : Faced with non-continuous gradient functions, the <em>forward</em> version of Euler discretization \(x_{n+1} = x_{n} – \gamma \nabla f(x_{n})\) can be replaced by the <em>backward</em> version $$x_{n+1} = x_{n} \, –  \gamma \nabla f(x_{n+1}),$$ which is only implicit as it can be solved by minimizing $$ f(x) + \frac{1}{2\gamma}\|x-x_{n}\|_2^2,$$ thus leading to the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithme_proximal_(optimisation)">proximal point algorithm</a>. Forward-backward schemes can also be recovered when \(f\) is the sum of a smooth and a non-smooth term.</li><li><em>Stochastic gradient descent</em> : There are two ways to deal with stochastic gradient descent, leading to two very different continuous limits. Adding independent and identically distributed (for simplicity) zero-mean noise \(\varepsilon_n\) to the gradient leads to the recursion $$x_{n+1} = x_{n} – \gamma \big[ \nabla f(x_{n}) + \varepsilon_n\big] = x_{n}\, – \gamma \nabla f(x_{n}) \,- \gamma \varepsilon_n,$$ where the noise is multiplied by the step-size \(\gamma\). Surprisingly, taking the limit when \(\gamma\) tends to zero leads to the deterministic gradient flow equation. A more detailed argument is presented at the end of post, but the main hand-waving reason is that the noise contribution vanishes because it is multiplied by the step-size. Note that this limiting behavior is consistent with a convergence to a minimizer of \(f\).</li><li><em>Convergence to a Langevin diffusion</em> : When instead the noise is added with magnitude proportional to the square root \(\sqrt{2 \gamma}\) of the step-size (which is asymptotically larger than \(\gamma\)), when \(\gamma\) tends to zero, and if the covariance of the noise is identity, we converge to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_process">diffusion process</a> which is the solution of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation">stochastic differential equation</a>: $$ dX(t) = \ – \nabla f(X(t)) + \sqrt{2} dB(t),$$ where \(B\) is a standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion">Brownian motion</a>. Moreover, as \(t\) tends to infinity, \(X(t)\) happens to tend in distribution to a random variable with density proportional to \(\exp( – f(x) )\). See more details at the end of the post and in [6]. The difference in behavior is illustrated below.</li></ul>

The flow is deterministic and converges to a stationary point of \(f\) (here the global minimum), while the diffusion is stochastic and converges to a distribution (which is typically not a point mass)</figure></div>



<h2>Properties of gradient flows</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The gradient flow $$ \dot{X}(t) = \ – \nabla f (X(t)) $$ is well-defined for a wide variety of conditions on the function \(f\). The most classical ones are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard%E2%80%93Lindel%C3%B6f_theorem">Lipschitz-continuity</a> of the gradient, or semi-convexity [<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13373-017-0101-1.pdf">7</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">The most obvious property is that the function decreases along the flow; in other words, \(f(X(t))\) is decreasing, which is a simple consequence of $$ \frac{d}{dt} f(X(t)) =  \nabla f(X(t))^\top \frac{dX(t)}{dt} =\  – \| \nabla f (X(t) )\|_2^2 \leqslant 0.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">If \(f\) is bounded from below, then \(f(X(t))\) will always converge (as a non-increasing function which is bounded from below, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotone_convergence_theorem">here</a>). However, in general, \(X(t)\) may not always converge without any further assumptions, e.g., it may oscillate forever. This is however rare and there are a variety of sufficient conditions for convergence of gradient flows, that date back to Lojasiewicz [8], and are based on “Lojasiewicz inequalities” that state that for \(y\) and \(x\) close enough, \(|f(x) – f(y)|^{1-\theta} \leqslant C \| \nabla f(x)\|\) for some \(C &gt; 0 \) and \(\theta \in (0,1)\). These are satisfied for “sub-analytical functions”, that include most functions one can imagine [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/sdfe/reader/pii/S0022247X05006864/pdf">9</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Once \(X(t)\) converges to some \(X(\infty) \in \mathbb{R}^d\), assuming \(\nabla f\) is continuous, we must have \(\nabla f(X(\infty))=0\), that is, \(X(\infty)\) is a stationary point of \(f\). Among all stationary points (that can be local minima, local maxima, or saddle-points), the one to which \(X(t)\) converges to depends on \(X(0)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Given any stationary point, one can look at the set of initializations that lead to it. Typically, only local minima are stable, that is, the attraction basins of other stationary points has typically zero Lebesgue measure (see, e.g., [<a href="http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v49/lee16.pdf">10</a>]). See examples below. </p>



<p class="justify-text">We start with a simple function defined on the two-dimensional plane, with several local minima and saddle-points.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="511" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/plot_non_convex-1.png" class="wp-image-3490" height="401" />Various gradient flows trajectories, starting from green points and ending in black points. Note the proximity of the three top starting points, all ending in different local minima. See the motion below.</figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img width="519" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/logistic_2d_flow_noncvx-1.gif" class="wp-image-3492" height="500" />Various gradient flows trajectories, in motion! All flows share the same time scale. Some seem “slower” than others (because the gradient norm is small).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Before moving on, I cannot resist presenting a “real” two-dimensional example that probably all skiers, hikers, and cyclists with some form of mathematical abilities have thought of, the topographic map. Here is an example below:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="458" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/glandon_croix_de_fer-1-1024x1024.jpg" class="wp-image-3751" height="458" />Extract from <a href="https://www.geoportail.gouv.fr/">IGN</a> topographic map, around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_du_Glandon">Col du Glandon</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_de_la_Croix_de_Fer">Col de la Croix de Fer</a> (French Alps).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Given the topographic map, how would gradient descent or gradient flow perform? Clearly, this corresponds to a non convex function, but it is quite well-behaved, as following water flows will typically lead to sea level. I chose two starting points famous to cyclists, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_du_Glandon">Col du Glandon</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_de_la_Croix_de_Fer">Col de la Croix de Fer</a>, and ran gradient descent with a small step-size (to approximate the gradient flow), without noise (left) and with noise (right), on the topographic map (thanks to <a href="http://recherche.ign.fr/labos/matis/cv.php?nom=Landrieu">Loïc Landrieu</a> for the data extraction).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/flows_final_square_small-1024x394.png" class="wp-image-3753" height="394" /></figure>



<p class="justify-text">Without noise, the descent from la Croix de Fer ends up getting stuck quickly in a local minimum, while the one from Glandon goes down to the valley, but then is not able to follow the almost flat slope. When noise is added, the two flows go a bit lower, highlighting the benefits of noise to escape local minima.</p>



<h2>Gradient flows for optimization and machine learning</h2>



<p class="justify-text">There are (at least) two key questions in optimization and machine learning related to gradient flows: </p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>When can we have global guarantees for convergence? That is, can we make sure that we choose an initialization point well enough to get the the global optimum <em>without knowing where the global optimum is</em>. A key difficulty is that the volume of the attraction basin of the global optimum can be made arbitrarily small, even for infinitely differentiable functions (imagine a function equal to zero everywhere except on a small ball where it is negative).</li><li>How fast can we get there? “there” can be a stationary point or a global optimum. This is an important question as mere convergence in the limit may be arbitrarily slow [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6707-gradient-descent-can-take-exponential-time-to-escape-saddle-points.pdf">11</a>].</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">An important class of function is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function">convex functions</a>, where everything works out very well. We will study them below. Other functions will be studied in future posts.</p>



<h2>Convex functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now assume that the function \(f\) is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function">convex</a> and differentiable. Within machine learning, this corresponds to objective functions encountered for supervised learning which are based on empirical risk minimization with a prediction function which is linearly parameterized, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic regression</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text">There are various definitions of convexity, which are based on global properties (the function is always “below its chords”, or it is always “above its tangents”) or local properties (the Hessian is always positive semi-definite). The one which we need here is to be above its tangents, that is, for any \(x, y \in \mathbb{R}^d\), $$f(x) \geqslant f(y)  + \nabla f(y)^\top ( x \, – y).$$ Applying this to any stationary point \(y\) such that \(\nabla f(y)=0\) shows that for all \(x\), \(f(x) \geqslant f(y)\), that is, \(y\) is a global minimizer of \(f\). This is the classical benefit of convexity: no need to worry about local minima.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Another property we will need is the Lojasiewicz inequality, which is in particular satisfied when \(f\) is \(\mu\)-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function#Strongly_convex_functions">strongly convex</a> (that is, \(f – \frac{\mu}{2} \| \cdot \|_2^2\) is convex): $$ f(x) \ – f(x_\ast) \leqslant \frac{1}{2 \mu} \| \nabla f (x)\|^2$$ for any minimizer \(x_\ast\) of \(f\) and any \(x\). This property allows to go from a bound on the gradient norm to a bound on function values.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We then obtain the convergence rate <em>in one line</em> as follows (see more details in [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6711-integration-methods-and-optimization-algorithms.pdf">12</a>]): $$ \frac{d}{dt} \big[ f(X(t))\ – f(x_\ast) \big] =\  \nabla f(X(t))^\top \dot{X}(t) =  \ – \| \nabla f(X(t))\|_2^2 \leqslant \ – 2\mu  \big[ f(X(t)) \ – f(x_\ast) \big]$$ using the Lojasiewicz inequality above, leading to by simple integration of the derivative of \(\log \big[ f(X(t)) \ – f(x_\ast) \big]\): $$f(X(t)) \ – f(x_\ast) \leqslant \exp( – 2\mu t ) \big[ f(X(0))\  – f(x_\ast) \big], $$ that is, the convergence is exponential and the characteristic time is proportional to \(1/\mu\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The gradient flow gives the main insight (exponential convergence); and applying the result above to \(t = \gamma n\), we seem to recover the traditional rate proportional to \(\exp( – \gamma \mu n)\); HOWEVER, this is only true asymptotically for \(\gamma\) tending to zero, and proving a result for gradient descent requires extra steps to deal with having a constant step-size. This requires typically \(\gamma \leqslant 1/L\), where \(L\) is the smoothness constant of \(f\), and the simplest proof happens to use the same structure (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.04636">13</a>] and references therein, as well as [<a href="http://www.mathnet.ru/php/getFT.phtml?jrnid=zvmmf&amp;paperid=7813&amp;what=fullt&amp;option_lang=eng">14</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Without strong convexity, we have, using the tangent property at \(X(t)\) and \(x_\ast\): $$ \frac{d}{dt}\big[   \| X(t)\ – x_\ast \|^2 \big] = \ –   2 ( X(t) \ – x_\ast )^\top \nabla f(X(t)) \leqslant \ – 2 \big[ f(X(t)) \ – f(x_\ast) \big],$$  leading to, by integrating from \(0\) to \(t\), and using the monotonicity of \(f(X(t))\): $$  f(X(t)) \ – f(x_\ast) \leqslant \frac{1}{t} \int_0^t \big[ f(X(u)) \ – f(x_\ast) \big] du \leqslant \frac{1}{2t} \| X(0) \ – x_\ast \|^2 \ – \frac{1}{2t} \| X(t) \ – x_\ast \|^2.$$ We recover the usual rates in \(O(1/n)\), with \(t = \gamma n\), with the same caveat as above (the step-size needs to be bounded).</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I covered the basic aspects of gradient flows, in particular their relationships with various forms of gradient descent, and their use in obtaining simple convergence justifications. Next months, I will cover extensions of the analyses above, in particular in terms of (1) acceleration for convex functions, where several flows and discretizations are interesting beyond the gradient flow and Euler method [12, 15], and (2) another class of functions which includes non-convex functions as encountered when learning with neural networks [16].</p>

<h2>Limits of stochastic gradient descent for vanishing step-sizes</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Convergence to gradient flow. </strong>We consider fixed times \(t = n \gamma \) and \(s = m \gamma\), and we let \(\gamma\) tend to zero, with thus \(m\) and \(n\) tending to infinity. Starting from the recursion $$x_{n+1} = x_{n}\, – \gamma \nabla f(x_{n})\  – \gamma \varepsilon_n,$$ we get the following by applying it \(m\) times: $$X(t+s) \ – X(t) = x_{n+m}-x_n = \ – \gamma \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \nabla f\Big(X\Big(t+\frac{sk}{m}\Big)\Big)\  – \gamma \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \varepsilon_{k+n}.$$ The term \(\displaystyle \gamma \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \nabla f\Big(X\Big(t+\frac{sk}{m}\Big)\Big)\) converges to \(\displaystyle \int_{t}^{t+s}\!\!\! \nabla f(X(u)) du\), while the term \(\gamma \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \varepsilon_{k+n}\) has zero expectation and variance equal to \(\gamma^2 m = \gamma s \) times the variance of each \(\varepsilon_{k+n}\), and thus it tends to zero (since \(\gamma\) tends to zero). Thus, in the limit, $$X(t+s)\  – X(t) = \ – \int_{t}^{t+s} \!\!\! \nabla f(X(u)) du,$$ which is equivalent to the gradient flow equation.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Convergence to diffusion.</strong> We consider the recursion $$x_{n+1} = x_{n}\,  – \gamma \nabla f(x_{n}) + \sqrt{2\gamma} \varepsilon_n.$$ With the same argument as above, we now get $$X(t+s) \ – X(t) = x_{n+m}-x_n =\ – \gamma \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \nabla f\Big(X\Big(t+\frac{sk}{m}\Big)\Big)\ – \sqrt{2\gamma} \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \varepsilon_{k+n}.$$ Now the second term has zero mean but a variance proportional to \(2s\) (<em>which does not go to zero when \(\gamma\) goes to zero</em>). We can then use when \(m\) tends to infinity the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process#Wiener_process_as_a_limit_of_random_walk">limit of the sum of independent variables as a Wiener process</a>, to get $$X(t+s)\ – X(t) =\  – \int_{t}^{t+s} \!\!\! \nabla f(X(u)) du + \sqrt{2} \big[ B(t+s)-B(t) \big].$$ The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%C3%B4_diffusion#Invariant_measures">limiting distribution</a> of \(X(t)\) happens to be the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_measure">Gibbs</a> distribution, with density \(\exp(-f(x))\) (the factor of \(\sqrt{2}\) was added to avoid an extra constant factor in the Gibbs distribution). More on this in a future post.</p></div>

<p>The third Foundations of Data Science virtual talk will take place next Friday, April 17th at 11:00 AM Pacific Time (2:00 pm Eastern Time, 20:00 Central European Time, 19:00 UTC).  <strong>Shachar Lovett</strong> from UC San Diego will speak about “<em>The power of asking more informative questions about the data</em>”.</p>



<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Many supervised learning algorithms (such as deep learning) need a large collection of labelled data points in order to perform well. However, what is easy to get are large amounts of unlabelled data. Labeling data is an expensive procedure, as it usually needs to be done manually, often by a domain expert. Active learning provides a mechanism to bridge this gap. Active learning algorithms are given a large collection of unlabelled data points. They need to smartly choose a few data points to query their label. The goal is then to automatically infer the labels of many other data points.</p>



<p>In this talk, we will explore the option of giving active learning algorithms additional power, by allowing them to have richer interaction with the data. We will see how allowing for even simple types of queries, such as comparing two data points, can exponentially improve the number of queries needed in various settings. Along the way, we will see interesting connections to both geometry and combinatorics, and a surprising application to fine grained complexity.</p>

<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I want to illustrate how computers can be great allies in designing (and verifying) convergence proofs for first-order optimization methods. This task can be daunting, and highly non-trivial, but nevertheless usually unavoidable when performing complexity analyses. A notable example is probably the convergence analysis of the stochastic average gradient (SAG) [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.2388.pdf">1</a>], whose original proof was computer assisted.</p>



<p class="justify-text">To this end, we will mostly spend time on what is referred to as <em>performance estimation problems</em> (PEPs), introduced by Yoel Drori and Marc Teboulle [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-013-0653-0">2</a>]. Performance estimation is also closely related to the topic of <em>integral quadratic constraints</em> (IQCs), introduced in the context of optimization by Laurent Lessard, Benjamin Recht and Andrew Packard [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/15M1009597">3</a>]. In terms of presentations, IQCs  leverages control theory, whereas PEPs might seem more natural in the optimization community. This blog post essentially presents PEPs from the point of view of [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>], instantiated on a running example.</p>



<h2>Overview, motivations</h2>



<p class="justify-text">First-order methods for continuous optimization belong to the large panel of algorithms that are usually approached via worst-case analyses. In this context, analyses rely on combining inequalities (that are due to assumptions on the problem classes), in potentially long, non-intuitive, and technical, proofs. For the insiders, those proofs all look very similar. For the outsiders, those proofs all look rather repelling, technical (long pages of chained inequalities), probably not interesting, and like computer codes: usually intuitive mostly for their authors.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In what follows, I want to show how (and why) those proofs are indeed all very similar. On the way, I want to emphasize how those combinations of inequalities are related to the “true essence” of worst-case analyses (which rely on computing worst-case scenarios), and to provide examples on how to constructively obtain them.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We take the stand of illustrating the PEP approach on a single iteration of gradient descent, as it essentially contains all necessary ingredients to understand the methodology in other contexts as well. Certain details of the following text are (probably unavoidably) a bit technical. However, going through the detailed computations is not essential, and the text should contain the necessary ingredients for understanding the essence of the methodology.</p>



<h2>Running example: gradient descent</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Let us consider a naive, but standard, example: unconstrained convex minimization $$x_\star= \underset{x\in\mathbb{R}^d}{\mathrm{arg min}} f(x)$$with gradient descent: \(x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma \nabla f(x_k)\). Let us assume \(f(\cdot)\) to be continuously differentiable, to have a \(L\)-Lipschitz gradient (a.k.a., \(L\)-smoothness), and to be \(\mu\)-strongly convex. Those functions satisfy, for all \(x,y\in\mathbb{R}^d\):<br />– strong convexity, see e.g., [<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-8853-9">5</a>, Definition 2.1.2]: $$\tag{1}f(x) \geqslant      f(y)+\langle{\nabla f(y)}; {x-y}\rangle+\tfrac{\mu}{2} \lVert x-y\rVert^2,$$- smoothness, see e.g., [<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-8853-9">5</a>, Theorem 2.1.5]: $$\tag{2} f(x) \leqslant      f(y)+\langle{\nabla f(y)}; {x-y}\rangle+\tfrac{L}{2}\lVert x-y\rVert^2.$$Let us recall that in the case of twice continuously differentiable functions, smoothness and strong convexity amount to requiring  that $$\mu I \preccurlyeq \nabla^2 f(x) \preccurlyeq L I,$$ for some \(0&lt; \mu&lt;L&lt; \infty\) and for all \(x\in\mathbb{R}^d\) (in other words, all eigenvalues of \(\nabla^2 f(x)\) are between \(\mu\) and \(L\)). In what follows, we denote by \(\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L}\) the class of \(L\)-smooth \(\mu\)-strongly convex functions (irrespective of the dimension \(d\)).</p>

</div></div>



<p class="justify-text">In this context, convergence of gradient descent can be studied in many ways. Here, for the sake of the example, we will do it in terms of two base quantities: distance to optimality \(\lVert x_k-x_\star\rVert\), and function value accuracy \(f(x_k)-f(x_\star)\). There are, of course, infinitely many other possibilities, such as gradient norm \(\rVert \nabla f(x_k)\lVert\), Bregman divergence \(f(x_\star)-f(x_k)-\langle{\nabla f(x_k)};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle\), or even best function value observed throughout the iterations \(\min_{0\leq i\leq k} \{f(x_i)-f(x_\star)\}\): the reader can adapt the lines below for his/her favorite criterion. </p>



<p class="justify-text">For later reference, let us provide another inequality that is known to  hold for all \(x,y\in\mathbb{R}^d\) for any \(L\)-smooth \( \mu\)-strongly convex function: <br />– bound on inner product, see, e.g., [<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-8853-9">5</a>,  Theorem 2.1.11]: $$\langle{\nabla f(x)-\nabla f(y)};{x-y}\rangle  \geqslant        \tfrac{1}{L+\mu} \lVert{\nabla f(x)-\nabla f(y)}\rVert^2+\tfrac{\mu  L}{L+\mu}\lVert{x-y}\rVert^2.\tag{3}$$ In the case \(\mu=0\) this inequality is known as “cocoercivity”. This (perhaps mysterious) inequality happens to play an important role in convergence proofs.</p>



<h3>A standard convergence result</h3>



<p class="justify-text">Let us start by stating two known results along with their simple proofs (see, e.g.,  [<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-8853-9">5</a>, Theorem 2.1.14] or [6, Section 1.4.2, Theorems 2 &amp; 3]):<br />– convergence in distance:  $$\begin{array}{rl}    \rVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\lVert^2&amp;= \lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2+\gamma^2\lVert{\nabla f(x_k)}\rVert^2-2\gamma\langle{\nabla f(x_k)};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle \\ \     &amp; \leqslant      \left(1-\tfrac{2\gamma L \mu}{L+\mu}\right)\lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2+\gamma\left(\gamma-\tfrac2{L+\mu}\right)\lVert{\nabla f(x_k)}\rVert^2, \end{array} $$ where the second line follows from smoothness and strong convexity of \(f\) via the bound (3) on the inner product (with \(x=x_k\) and \(y=x_\star\)). For the particular choice \(\gamma=\tfrac2{L+\mu}\), the second term on the right hand side disappears, and we end up with<br />     $$\lVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\rVert^2 \leqslant      \left(\tfrac{L-\mu}{L+\mu}\right)^2\lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2,$$ which, following from \(0&lt;\mu&lt;L&lt;\infty\), satisfies \(0&lt; \tfrac{L-\mu}{L+\mu}&lt;1\), hence proving linear convergence of gradient descent in this setup, by recursively applying the previous inequality: $$ \lVert{x_{k}-x_\star}\rVert^2 \leqslant      \left(\tfrac{L-\mu}{L+\mu}\right)^{2k}\lVert{x_0-x_\star}\rVert^2.$$ – Convergence in function values: one can simply use the result in distance along with the previous basic inequalities (1) and (2) characterizing smoothness and strong convexity (both with \(y=x_\star\)):<br />     $$f(x_k)-f(x_\star) \leqslant \hspace{-.15cm}\tfrac{L}{2}\hspace{-.1cm}\rVert{x_k-x_\star}\lVert^2  \leqslant  \hspace{-.15cm}    \tfrac{L}{2}\hspace{-.1cm}\left(\tfrac{L-\mu}{L+\mu}\right)^{\hspace{-.1cm}2k} \rVert{x_0-x_\star}\lVert^2 \leqslant  \hspace{-.15cm}     \tfrac{L}{\mu}\hspace{-.1cm} \left(\tfrac{L-\mu}{L+\mu}\right)^{\hspace{-.1cm}2k}(f(x_0)-f(x_\star)).$$  It is also possible to directly look for convergence in terms of function values, but it is then usually unclear in the literature what inequalities to use, and I am not aware of any such proof leading to the same rate without the leading \(\tfrac{L}{\mu}\) (except the proof presented below).</p>



<p class="justify-text">At this point, even in this toy example, a few very legitimate questions can be raised:<br />– can we improve anything? Can gradient descent really behaves like that on this class of functions?<br />– How could we have guessed the inequality to use, and the shape of the corresponding proof? Obviously, the obscure fact is to arrive to inequality (1).  Therefore, is there a principled way for choosing the right inequalities to use, for example for studying convergence in terms of other quantities, such as  function values?<br />– Is this the unique way to arrive to the desired result? If yes, how likely are we to find such proofs for more complicated cases (algorithms and/or function class)?</p>



<p class="justify-text">For the specific step size choice \(\gamma=\tfrac2{L+\mu}\), a partial answer to the first question is obtained by the observation that the rate is actually achieved on the quadratic function<br /> $$f(x)=\tfrac12 \, x^\top \begin{bmatrix}<br /> L &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; \mu<br /> \end{bmatrix}x.$$ The following lines precisely target the missing answers.</p>



<h2>Worst-case analysis through worst-case scenarios</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Let us start by rephrasing our goal, and restrict ourselves to the study of a single iteration. We fix our target to finding the smallest possible value of \(\rho\) such that the inequality<br /> $$ \lVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\rVert^2  \leqslant       \rho^2 \lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2 $$ is valid for all \(x_k\) and \(x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma \nabla f(x_k)\) (hence \(\rho\) is a function of \(\gamma\)). In other words, our goal is to solve<br />$$ \rho^2(\gamma):= \sup \left\{ \frac{\lVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\rVert^2}{\lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2}\, \big|\, f\in\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L},\, x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma \nabla f(x_k),\, \nabla f(x_\star)=0\right\}.$$<br />Alternatively, we could be interested in studying convergence in other forms: for function values, we could target to solve the slightly modified problem:<br /> $$ \sup  \left\{ \frac{f(x_{k+1})-f(x_\star)}{f(x_{k})-f(x_\star)}\, \big|\, f\in\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L},\, x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma \nabla f(x_k),\, \nabla f(x_\star)=0 \right\}.$$ It turns out that in both cases, the problem can be solved both numerically to high precision, and analytically, and that the answer is \(\rho^2(\gamma)=\max\{(1-\mu\gamma)^2,(1-L\gamma)^2\}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The only thing we did, so far, was to explicitly reformulate the problem of finding the best (smallest) convergence rate as the problem of finding the worst-case scenario, nothing more. In what follows, some parts might become slightly technical, but the overall idea is only to reformulate this problem of finding the worst-case scenarios, for solving it.</p>



<h3>Dealing with an infinite-dimensional variable: the function \(f\)</h3>



<p class="justify-text">The first observation is that the problem of computing \(\rho\) is stated as an infinite-dimensional optimization problem: we are looking for the worst possible problem instance (a function \(f\) and an initial point \(x_k\)) within a predefined class of problems. The first step we take to work around this is to reformulate it in the following equivalent  form (note that we maximize also over the dimension \(d\)—we discuss later how to remove it):<br />$$\begin{array}{rl} \rho^2:= \underset{f,\, x_k,\,x_\star,\, g_k,\,d}{\sup} &amp;\displaystyle \frac{\lVert{x_{k}-\gamma g_k-x_\star}\rVert^2}{\lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2}\\<br /> \text{s.t. }    &amp; \exists f\in\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L}:\, g_k= \nabla f(x_k),\, 0=\nabla f(x_\star).<br />\end{array}$$<br />This problem intrinsically does not look better (it contains an  existence constraint), but it allows using mathematical tools which are referred to as  <em>interpolation,</em> or <em>extension</em>, theorems [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00241.pdf">7</a>, <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01530908/file/DHLL_appendix.pdf">8</a>]. The problem is depicted on Figure 2:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="490" alt="" src="https://www.di.ens.fr/~ataylor/BlogPost/Interpolation.png" height="209" />Figure 2: discrete interpolation (or extension) problem: given a set of triplets \(\{(\text{coordinate}, \text{gradient}, \text{function value})\}\) can we recover a function within a determined class that explains those triplets?</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out that convex interpolation (that is, neglecting smoothness and strong convexity) is actually rather simple:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>given a convex function and an index set \(I\), any set of samples \(\{(x_i,g_i,f_i)\}_{i\in I}\) of the form \(\{(\text{coordinate}, \text{(sub)gradient}, \text{function value})\}\)) satisfies, for all \(i,j\in I\): $$f_i \geqslant      f_j+\langle g_j; x_i-x_j\rangle,$$ by definition of subgradient, as illustrated on Figure 3.</li></ul>

<ul class="justify-text"><li>In the other direction, given a set of triplets \(\{(x_i,g_i,f_i)\}_{i\in I}\) satisfying the previous inequality for all pairs \(i,j\in I\), one can simply recover a  convex function by the following construction: $$f(x)=\underset{i\in I}{\max}\{ f_i+\langle g_i;x-x_i\rangle\},$$ which is depicted on Figure 4.</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="487" alt="" src="https://www.di.ens.fr/~ataylor/BlogPost/InterpolateCvx.png" height="207" />Figure 4: some set \(\{(x_i,g_i,f_i)\}_{i\in I}\) and its piecewise affine interpolant \(f(x)=\underset{i\in I}{\max}\{ f_i+\langle g_i;x-x_i\rangle\}\).</figure></div>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>Formally, the reasoning allows arriving to the following “convex interpolation” (or “convex extension”) result, where we denote the set of (closed, proper) convex functions by \(\mathcal{F}_{0,\infty}\) (to be understood as \(L\)-smooth \(\mu\)-strongly convex functions with \(\mu=0\) and \(L=\infty\)): $$\begin{array}{c}\exists f\in\mathcal{F}_{0,\infty}: \,  g_k\in\partial f(x_k) \text{ and } f_k=f(x_k) \ \ \forall k\in  I\\ \Leftrightarrow\\ f_i \geqslant       f_j+\langle{g_j};{x_i-x_j}\rangle\quad \forall i,j\in I,\end{array}$$ where \(\partial f(x)\) denotes the subdifferential of \(f\) at \(x\).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">In the next section, we use a similar interpolation result for taking smoothness and strong convexity into account. The result is a bit more technical, but follows from similar constructions as those for convex interpolation—the main difference being that the interpolation is done on the Fenchel conjugate instead, in order to incorporate smoothness, see [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>, Section 2].</p>



<h3>Reformulation through convex interpolation</h3>



<p class="justify-text">Back to the problem of computing worst-case scenarios, we can now reformulate the existence constraint <em>exactly</em> using the following result (see [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>,  Theorem 4]): let \(I\) be a finite index set and let \( S=\{(x_i,g_i,f_i)\}_{i\in I}\) be a set of triplets, then<br />  $$\begin{array}{c}\exists f\in\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L}: \,  g_i=\nabla f(x_i) \text{ and } f_i=f(x_i) \text{ for all } i\in  I\\ \Leftrightarrow\\  f_i \geqslant      f_j+\langle{g_j};{x_i-x_j}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_i-g_j}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_i-x_j-\frac{{1}}{L}(g_i-g_j)}\rVert^2  \,\,\, \forall i,j\in I.\end{array}$$ Therefore, the previous problem can be reformulated as (recalling that \(g_\star=0\))<br />$$  \begin{array}{rl} \underset{{f_k,\,f_\star,\, x_k,\,x_\star,\, g_k,\,d}} {\sup}&amp;\displaystyle\frac{\rVert{x_{k}-\gamma  g_k-x_\star}\lVert^2}{\rVert{x_k-x_\star}\lVert^2}\\<br />      \text{s.t. }    &amp; f_\star \geqslant      f_k+\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2\\<br />      &amp; f_k \geqslant      f_\star+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2.<br />\end{array}$$ </p>



<h3>Quadratic reformulation</h3>



<p class="justify-text">The next step is to remove the ratio appearing in the objective function, which we do via an homogeneity argument, as follows.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Starting from a feasible point, scale \(x_k,\,x_\star,g_k\) by some \(\alpha&gt;0\) and \(f_k,\,f_\star\) by \(\alpha^2\) and observe it does not change the value of the objective, while still being a feasible point. Therefore, the problem can be reformulated as a nonconvex QCQP (quadratically constrained quadratic program): $$  \begin{array}{rl} \underset{{f_k,\,f_\star,\, x_k,\,x_\star,\, g_k,\,d}} {\sup}&amp;\displaystyle{\rVert{x_{k}-\gamma  g_k-x_\star}\lVert^2}\\<br />       \text{s.t. }    &amp; f_\star \geqslant      f_k+\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2\\<br />       &amp; f_k \geqslant      f_\star+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2\\ &amp;{\rVert{x_k-x_\star}\lVert^2} \leqslant      1,<br /> \end{array}$$  which is quadratic in \(x_k\), \(x_\star\) and  \(g_k\), and linear in \(f_\star\) and \(f_k\). Actually, in the current form, nonconvexity comes from the term “\(\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle\)” in the second constraint (and from the objective, due to maximization). It turns out that this problem can be reformulated <em>losslessly</em> using semidefinite programming (this is due to the maximization over \(d\), as commented at the end of the next section). </p>



<h3>Semidefinite reformulation</h3>



<p class="justify-text">At the end of this section, we will be able to compute, numerically, the values of the rate \(\rho^2(\gamma)\) for given values of the parameters \(\mu,\,L\), and \(\gamma\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The last step in the reformulation goes as follows: the previous problem can be reformulated as a semidefinite program, as it is linear in terms of the entries of the following Gram matrix<br />$$G = \begin{pmatrix}<br />     \lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2 &amp; \langle{g_k};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle \\ \langle{g_k};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle &amp; \lVert{g_k}\rVert^2<br />     \end{pmatrix}\succcurlyeq 0,$$ and in terms of the function values \(f_k\) and \(f_\star\). From those variables, one reformulate the previous problem as $$\begin{array}{rl} \underset{f_k,\,f_\star,\, G\succeq 0}{\sup} \, &amp;{\mathrm{Tr} (A_\text{num} G)}\\<br />      \text{s.t. }    &amp; f_k-f_\star+\mathrm{Tr} (A_1 G)\leqslant 0\\<br />      &amp;  f_\star-f_k+\mathrm{Tr} (A_2 G)\leqslant 0 \\<br />      &amp;\mathrm{Tr} (A_\text{denom} G) \leqslant      1,\end{array}$$ which is a gentle semidefinite program where we picked matrices \(A_{\text{num}}\), \(A_{\text{denom}}\), \(A_1\) and \(A_2\) for encoding the previous terms. That is, we choose those matrices such that<br /> $$\begin{array}{rl}<br />\mathrm{Tr}(A_{\text{denom}} G)&amp;=\lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2,\\  \mathrm{Tr}(A_{\text{num}} G)&amp;=\lVert{x_k-\gamma g_k-x_\star}\rVert^2,\\ \mathrm{Tr}(A_1G)&amp;=\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2,\\ \mathrm{Tr}(A_2G)&amp;=\tfrac{1}{2L}\lVert g_k\rVert^2+\tfrac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert x_k-x_\star-\tfrac1L g_k\rVert^2.\end{array}$$ One possibility is to choose \(A_{\text{num}}\), \(A_{\text{denom}}\), \(A_1\) and \(A_2\) as symmetric matrices, as follows: $$\begin{array}{cc}<br /> A_{\text{denom}}=\begin{pmatrix}     1 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0     \end{pmatrix}, &amp; A_{\text{num}}=\begin{pmatrix}     1 &amp; -\gamma\\ -\gamma &amp; \gamma^2     \end{pmatrix}, \\ A_1=\begin{pmatrix}\tfrac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)} &amp; -\tfrac12-\tfrac{\mu}{2(L-\mu)} \\ -\tfrac12-\tfrac{\mu}{2(L-\mu)} &amp; \tfrac{1}{2L}+\tfrac{\mu}{2L(L-\mu)}\end{pmatrix}, &amp;  A_2=\begin{pmatrix}\tfrac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)} &amp; -\tfrac{\mu}{2(L-\mu)} \\ -\tfrac{\mu}{2(L-\mu)} &amp; \tfrac{1}{2L}+\tfrac{\mu}{2L(L-\mu)} \end{pmatrix}.\end{array}$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">All those steps can be carried out in the exact same way for the problem of computing the convergence rate for function values, reaching a similar problem with \(6\) inequality constraints instead—because interpolation conditions have to be imposed on all pairs of points in a set of \(3\) points: \(x_k\), \(x_{k+1}\) and \(x_\star\), instead of only \(2\) for the distance problem. The objective function is then \(f_{k+1}-f_\star\), the de-homogenization constraint (arising from the denominator of the objective function) is \(f_{k}-f_\star \leqslant     1\), and the Gram matrix is \(3\times 3\):<br />$$G=\begin{pmatrix}<br />     \lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2 &amp; \langle{g_k};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle&amp; \langle{g_{k+1}};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle\\ \langle{g_k};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle &amp; \lVert{g_k}\rVert^2 &amp; \langle{g_k};{g_{k+1}}\rangle \\<br />     \langle{g_{k+1}};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle &amp; \langle{g_{k+1}};{g_k}\rangle &amp; \lVert{g_{k+1}}\rVert^2<br />     \end{pmatrix}\succcurlyeq 0, $$ and the function values variables are \(f_k\), \(f_{k+1}\) and \(f_\star\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We provide the numerical optimal values of those semidefinite programs on Figure 5 for both convergence in distances and in function values. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="534" alt="" src="https://www.di.ens.fr/~ataylor/BlogPost/ObjectiveValues.png" height="324" />Figure 5: worst-cases of the ratio \(\frac{\lVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\rVert^2}{\lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2}\) (red) and \(\frac{f(x_{k+1})-f_\star}{f(x_k)-f_\star}\) (dashed blue) as functions of the step size \(\gamma\), for the case where \(f\) is \(1\)-smooth and \(0.1\)-strongly convex. The results match exactly the expected \(\max\{(1-\gamma L)^2,(1-\gamma\mu)^2\}\) in both cases. Note that the corresponding SDPs can be solved both for “good and bad” choices of step sizes: if the step size is chosen wisely then \(\rho(\gamma)&lt;1\), and otherwise \(\rho(\gamma)\geqslant 1\). The SDP confirms the common knowledge that \(\gamma\in (0,2/L)\Rightarrow \rho(\gamma)&lt; 1\). Numerical values obtained through YALMIP [<a href="https://yalmip.github.io/">9</a>] and Mosek [<a href="https://www.mosek.com/">10</a>].</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">As a conclusion for this section, let us note that we showed how to compute the “best” rates that are dimension independent. In general, requiring the iterates and gradient (e.g., \(x_k\) and \(g_k\) for the problem in terms of distance, and \(x_k\), \(g_k\) and \(g_{k+1}\) for function values, and potentially more vectors when dealing with more complex settings) to lie in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) is equivalent to adding a rank constraint in the SDP. </p>



<h2>Duality between worst-case scenarios and combinations of inequalities</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Any feasible point to the previous SDP corresponds to a <em>lower bound</em>: a sampled version of a potentially difficult function for gradient descent. If we want to find <em>upper bounds</em> on the rate, a natural way to proceed is to go to the dual side of the previous SDPs, where any feasible point will naturally correspond to an upper bound on the convergence rate (by <em>weak duality</em>). As the primal problems were SDPs, their Lagrangian duals are SDPs as well. Let us associate one multiplier per constraint: $$ \begin{array}{rl}<br />f_k-f_\star+\mathrm{Tr} (A_1 G)\leqslant 0&amp;:\lambda_1\\<br />f_\star-f_k+\mathrm{Tr} (A_2 G)\leqslant 0&amp;:\lambda_2\\<br />\mathrm{Tr}(A_\text{denom} G) \leqslant 1&amp;: \tau.<br />\end{array}$$The dual is then<br />$$\begin{array}{rl}<br /> \underset{\tau,\,\lambda_1,\,\lambda_2}{\min} &amp; \, \tau \\<br /> \text{s.t. } &amp; \lambda_1=\lambda_2,\\<br /> &amp; S:=A_\text{num}-\tau A_\text{denom}-\lambda_1A_1-\lambda_2A_2 \preccurlyeq 0,\\<br /> &amp;\tau,\lambda_1,\lambda_2 \geqslant  0.<br /> \end{array}$$ Hence, by weak duality, any feasible point to this last SDP corresponds to an upper bound on the rate: \(\tau \geqslant \rho^2\). A mere rephrasing of weak duality can be obtained through the following reasoning: assume we received some feasible \(\tau,\lambda_1,\lambda_2\) (and hence \(\lambda_1=\lambda_2\) and a corresponding \(S\preccurlyeq 0\)), we then get, for any primal feasible \(G\succcurlyeq0\):<br />$$\begin{array}{rl}\mathrm{Tr}(SG)&amp;=\mathrm{Tr}(A_{\text{num}}G)-\tau\mathrm{Tr}(A_{\text{denom}}G)-\lambda_1\mathrm{Tr}(A_1G)-\lambda_2\mathrm{Tr}(A_2G)\\&amp;=\lVert x_{k+1}-x_\star\rVert^2-\tau\lVert x_{k}-x_\star\rVert^2\\ \,&amp;\,\,\,-\lambda_1[     f_k-f_\star+\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2]\\ &amp;\,\,\,-\lambda_2 [f_\star-f_k+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2]\\ &amp;\geqslant \lVert x_{k+1}-x_\star\rVert^2-\tau\lVert x_{k}-x_\star\rVert^2, \end{array}$$ where the first equality follows from the definition of \(S\), the second equality corresponds to the definitions of \(A_{\text{num}}\), \(A_{\text{denom}}\), \(A_1\) and \(A_2\), and the last inequality follows from the sign of the interpolation inequalities (constraints in the primal) for any primal feasible point. Hence, we indeed have that any feasible \(\tau\) corresponds to a valid upper bound on the convergence rate, as $$S\preccurlyeq 0 \,\,\Rightarrow \,\, \mathrm{Tr}(SG)\leqslant 0\,\,\Rightarrow  \lVert x_{k+1}-x_\star\rVert^2-\tau\lVert x_{k}-x_\star\rVert^2\leqslant 0.$$ In order to obtain analytical proofs, we therefore need to find analytical dual feasible points, and numerics can of course help in this process! Let’s look at what the optimal dual solutions look like for our two running examples.</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li> in Figure 6, we provide the numerical values for \(\lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_2\) for the distance problem.</li></ul>

<ul class="justify-text"><li>For function values, the SDP is slightly more complicated, as more inequalities are involved (6 interpolation inequalities). We provide raw numerical values for the six multipliers in Figure 7.</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="463" alt="" src="https://www.di.ens.fr/~ataylor/BlogPost/Multipliers_function.png" height="348" />Figure 7: numerical values of optimal dual variables (for the rate in function values): \(\lambda_1,\lambda_2, …,\lambda_6\) as functions of the step size \(\gamma\), for the case where \(f\) is \(1\)-smooth and \(0.1\)-strongly convex.

<p>For those who want a bit more details, here are a few additional pointers:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>Strong duality holds—a way to prove it is to show that there exists a Slater point in the primal, see e.g., [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>, Theorem 6]—, and hence primal and dual optimal values match.</li><li>There might be different ways to optimaly combine the interpolation inequalities for proving the desired results. In other words: dual optimal solutions are often not unique—which is, in fact, quite a good news: I am sure nobody want to find the analytical version of the multipliers provided in Figure 7.</li><li>It is often possible to simplify the proofs by using fewer, or weaker, inequalities. This might lead to ”cleaner” results, typically (but not always) at the cost of ”weaker” rates. This was done for designing the proof for function values, later in this text.</li></ul>



<h2>Combinations of inequalities: same proofs without SDPs</h2>



<p class="justify-text">So far, we showed that computing convergence rates can be done in a very principled way. To this end, one can solve semidefinite programs—which may have arbitrarily complicated analytical solutions. Here, I want to emphasize that the process of <em>verifying</em> a solution can be quite different to that of<em> finding</em> a solution. Put in other words, although the dual certificates (a.k.a., the proofs) might have been found by solving SDPs, they can be formulated in ways that do not require the reader to know anything about the PEP methodology, nor on any SDP material, for verifying them. This fact might actually not be very surprising to the reader, as many proofs arising in the first-order optimization literature actually “only consists” in linear combinations of (quadratic) inequalities. On the one hand, those proofs can be seen as feasible points to “dual SDPs”, although generally not explicitely proved as such. On the other hand, proofs arising from the SDPs might therefore be expected to be writable without any explicit reference to semidefinite programing and performance estimation problems.<br /></p>



<p class="justify-text">In what follows, we provide the proofs for gradient descent, using the previous numerical inspiration, but without explicitly relying on any semidefinite program. The reader is not expected to verify any of those computations, as our goal is rather to emphasize that the principles underlying both proofs are exactly the same: reformulating linear combinations of inequalities.</p>



<p class="justify-text">For both proofs below, we limit ourselves to the step size regime \(0\leq   \gamma \leq \tfrac{2}{L+\mu}\), and we prove  that, in  this regime, \(\rho(\gamma)=(1-\gamma\mu)\)—actually we only proof the upper bounds, but one can easily verify that they are <em>tight</em> on simple quadratic functions.  The complete proofs (for the proximal gradient method),  can be found in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.04398.pdf">11</a>]. </p>



<h3>Example 1: distance to optimality</h3>



<p class="justify-text">Recall the notations: \(g_k:=\nabla f(x_k)\), \(f_k:= f(x_k)\), \(g_\star:=\nabla f(x_\star)\), and \(f_\star:= f(x_\star)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">For distance to optimality, sum the following inequalities with their corresponding weights: $$\begin{array}{r}     f_\star \geqslant      f_k+\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k-g_\star}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}(g_k-g_\star)}\rVert^2  :\lambda_1,  \\     f_k \geqslant      f_\star+\langle{g_\star};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k-g_\star}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}(g_k-g_\star)}\rVert^2:\lambda_2.     \end{array}$$ We use the following values for the multipliers: \(\lambda_1=\lambda_2=2\gamma\rho(\gamma) \geqslant      0\) (see Figure 6). </p>



<p class="justify-text">After appropriate substitutions of \(g_\star\), \(x_{k+1}\), and \(\rho(\gamma)\), using respectively \(g_\star=0\), \(x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma g_k\) and \(\rho(\gamma)=(1-\gamma\mu)\), and with little effort, one can check that the previous weighted sum of inequalities can be written in the form: $$ \begin{array}{rl}    \lVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\rVert^2  \leqslant      &amp; \left(1-\gamma \mu \right)^2\lVert{x_{k}-x_\star}\rVert^2 -\frac{\gamma(2-\gamma (L+\mu))}{L-\mu} \lVert{\mu {(x_k  -x_\star)} – g_k}\rVert^2. \end{array}$$ This statement can be checked simply by expanding both expressions (i.e., the weighted sum and its reformulation) and verifying that all terms indeed match.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Finally, using $$\gamma(2-\gamma (L+\mu)) \geqslant      0,  \text{ and } L-\mu \geqslant      0,$$ which are nonnegative by assumptions on the values of \(L\in(0,\infty)\), \(\mu\in (0,L)\) and \(\gamma\in(0,2/(L+\mu))\), we arrive to the desired $$ \lVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\rVert^2 \leqslant      \left(1-\gamma \mu \right)^2\lVert{x_{k}-x_\star}\rVert^2.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that, by using \(\lambda_1=\lambda_2\), the weighted sum exactly corresponds to the (scaled by a positive constant) inequality introduced in the early stage of this note for studying distance to optimality. However, the resulting expression is tight for all values of the step size here, whereas it was only tight for \(\gamma=2/(L+\mu)\) earlier, due to a different choice of weights! </p>



<p class="justify-text">The curious reader might wonder how to find such a reformulation. Actually, back in terms of SDPs, and using the expressions for the multipliers, it simply corresponds to $$\mathrm{Tr}(SG)=-\frac{\gamma(2-\gamma (L+\mu))}{L-\mu} \lVert{\mu {(x_k  -x_\star)} – g_k}\rVert^2.$$ In the example below, the reformulation is a bit more tricky—as \(\mathrm{Tr}(SG)\)  has two nonnegative terms, which were simply obtained by doing an analytical Cholesky factorization of the term \(\mathrm{Tr}(SG)\)—, but the idea is exactly the same.</p>



<h3>Example 2: function values</h3>



<p class="justify-text">For function values, we combine the following inequalities after multiplication with their respective coefficients:    </p>



<p class="justify-text">$$\scriptsize \begin{array}{lr}     f_k \geqslant      f_{k+1}+\langle{g_{k+1}};{x_k-x_{k+1}}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k-g_{k+1}}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_{k+1}-\frac{1}{L}(g_k-g_{k+1})}\rVert^2    &amp;:\lambda_1,\\<br />f_\star \geqslant      f_k+\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k-g_\star}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{1}{L}(g_k-g_\star)}\rVert^2  &amp;:\lambda_2, \\<br />f_\star \geqslant      f_{k+1}+\langle{g_{k+1}};{x_\star-x_{k+1}}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_\star-g_{k+1}}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_\star-x_{k+1}-\frac{1}{L}(g_\star-g_{k+1})}\rVert^2  &amp;:\lambda_3.     \end{array}$$ We use the following multipliers \(\lambda_1=\rho(\gamma)\), \(\lambda_2=(1-\rho(\gamma))\rho(\gamma)\), and  \(\lambda_3=1-\rho(\gamma)\) (obtained by greedily trying to set different combinations of multipliers to \(0\) in the SDP—see Figure 7 for the values without such simplifications).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Again, after appropriate substitutions of \(g_\star\), \(x_{k+1}\), and \(\rho(\gamma)\), using respectively \(g_\star=0\), \(x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma g_k\) and \(\rho(\gamma)=(1-\gamma\mu)\), we obtain that the weighted sum of inequalities can be reformulated exactly as $$  \begin{array}{rl}          f(x_{k+1})-f_\star \leqslant      &amp;\left(1-\gamma \mu\right)^2 \left(f(x_k)-f_\star\right)\\&amp;-\frac{1}{2 (L-\mu)}\lVert \nabla f(x_{k+1})-(1-\gamma  (L+\mu))\nabla f(x_k) +\gamma  \mu  L (x_\star-x_k)\rVert^2\\<br />&amp;-\frac{\gamma  L(2- \gamma  (L+\mu))}{2 (L-\mu )}\lVert \nabla f(x_k)+\mu  (x_\star-x_k)\rVert^2.\end{array}$$ Again, this statement can be checked simply by expanding both expressions (i.e., the weighted sum and its reformulation), and verifying that all terms match. The desired conclusion $$ f(x_{k+1})-f_\star \leqslant \left(1-\gamma \mu\right)^2 \left(f(x_k)-f_\star\right), $$ follows from the signs of the leading coefficients: \(\gamma(2-\gamma (L+\mu)) \geqslant      0\), and \(L-\mu \geqslant      0\).</p>



<h3>To go further</h3>



<p class="justify-text">Before finishing, let us mention that we only dealt with linear convergence through a single iteration of gradient descent.</p>



<p class="justify-text">There are quite a few ways to handle both more iterations and sublinear convergence rates. Using SDPs, probably the most natural approach is to directly incorporate several iterations in the problem by  studying, for example, ratios of the form  $$\sup_{f\in\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L},\, x_0}  \frac{f(x_{N})-f_\star}{\lVert x_0-x_\star\rVert^2}. $$ This type of approach was used in the work of Drori and Teboulle [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.3209.pdf">2</a>] and in most consecutive PEP-related works: it has the advantage of providing  comfortable “non-improvable results” [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.07516.pdf">12</a>]   (by providing matching lower bounds) for any given \(N\), but requires solving larger and larger SDPs. Alternatively, simpler proofs can often be obtained through the use of  Lyapunov (or potential) functions—i.e., study a single iteration to produce recursable inequalities; a nice introduction is provided in [<a href="http://www.theoryofcomputing.org/articles/v015a004/v015a004.pdf">13</a>]. This idea can be exploited in PEPs [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00947.pdf">14</a>] by enforcing the proofs to have a certain structure. Those principles are also at the heart of the related approach using integral quadratic constraints [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/15M1009597">3</a>, <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/hu17a/hu17a.pdf">15</a>]. </p>



<h2>Take-home message and conclusions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The overall message of this note is that first-order methods can often be studied directly using the definition of their “worst-cases” (i.e., by trying to find worst-case scenarios), along with their dual counterparts (linear combinations of inequalities), by translating them into semidefinite programs.</p>



<p class="justify-text">What we saw might look like an overkill for studying gradient descent. However, as long as we deal with Euclidean spaces, the same approach actually works beyond this simple case. In particular, the same technique applies to first-order methods performing explicit, projected, proximal, conditional, and inexact (sub)gradient steps [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.07516.pdf">12</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Finally, let us mention a few previous works illustrating that the use of such computer-assisted proofs allowed obtaining results that are apparently too complicated for us to find bare-handed—even in apparently simple contexts.  Reasonable examples include the direct proof for convergence rates in  function values [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.04398.pdf">11</a>] presented above, but also proofs arising in the context of optimized numerical schemes [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.3209.pdf">2</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2636">16</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.5468.pdf">17</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06600.pdf">18</a>]—in particular [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06600.pdf">18</a>] presents a method for minimizing the gradient norm at the last iterate, in smooth convex minimization—,  in the context of monotone inclusions [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00146.pdf">19</a>],  and even for more general fixed-point problems (e.g., for Halpern iterations [<a href="http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2017/11/6336.pdf">20</a>]).</p>



<h3>Toolbox</h3>



<p class="justify-text">The PErformance EStimation TOolbox (PESTO) [<a href="https://perso.uclouvain.be/julien.hendrickx/availablepublications/PESTO_CDC_2017.pdf">21</a>, see <a href="https://github.com/AdrienTaylor/Performance-Estimation-Toolbox/graphs/traffic">Github</a>] allows a quick access to the methodology without worrying about details of semidefinite reformulations. The toolbox contains many  examples (about 50) in different settings, and include progresses on the approach, and results, by other groups (which are much more thoroughly referenced in the <a href="https://github.com/AdrienTaylor/Performance-Estimation-Toolbox/blob/master/UserGuide.pdf">user guide</a>). In particular, we included standard classes of functions and operators, along with examples for analyzing recent optimized methods.</p>

<p>The second Foundations of Data Science virtual talk will take place next Friday, March 27th at 11:00 AM Pacific Time (2:00 pm Eastern Time, 20:00 Central European Time, 19:00 UTC).  <strong>Sujay Sanghavi</strong> from University of Texas at Austin will speak about “<em>Towards Model Agnostic Robustness</em>”.</p>



<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: It is now common practice to try and solve machine learning problems by starting with a complex existing model or architecture, and fine-tuning/adapting it to the task at hand. However, outliers, errors or even just sloppiness in training data often lead to drastic drops in performance. </p>



<p>We investigate a simple generic approach to correct for this, motivated by a classic statistical idea: trimmed loss. This advocates jointly (a) selecting which training samples to ignore, and (b) fitting a model on the remaining samples. As such this is computationally infeasible even for linear regression. We propose and study the natural iterative variant that alternates between these two steps (a) and (b) – each of which individually can be easily accomplished in pretty much any statistical setting. We also study the batch-SGD variant of this idea. We demonstrate both theoretically (for generalized linear models) and empirically (for vision and NLP neural network models) that this effectively recovers accuracy in the presence of bad training data.</p>

<p class="justify-text">This month, I will follow up on <a href="https://francisbach.com/acceleration-without-pain/">last month’s blog post</a>, and describe classical techniques from numerical analysis that aim at accelerating the convergence of a vector sequence to its limit, by only combining elements of the sequence, and without the detailed knowledge of the iterative process that has led to this sequence. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Last month, I focused on sequences that converge to their limit exponentially fast (which is referred to as <em>linear</em> convergence), and I described <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitken%27s_delta-squared_process">Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\) method</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanks_transformation">Shanks transformation</a>, Anderson acceleration and its <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04133">regularized version</a>. These methods are called “non-linear” acceleration techniques, because, although they combine linearly iterates as \(c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1} + \cdots + c_m x_{k+m}\), the scalar weights in the linear combination depend non-linearly on \(x_k,\dots,x_{k+m}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I will focus on sequences that converge sublinearly, that is, with a difference to their limit that goes to zero as an inverse power of \(k\), typically in \(O(1/k)\). </p>



<h2>Richardson extrapolation</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider a sequence \((x_k)_{k \geq 0} \in \mathbb{R}^d\), with an asymptotic expansion of the form $$ x_k = x_\ast + \frac{1}{k}\Delta + O\Big(\frac{1}{k^2}\Big), $$ where \(x_\ast \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is the limit of \((x_k)_k\) and \(\Delta\) a vector in \(\mathbb{R}^d\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The idea behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson_extrapolation">Richardson extrapolation</a> [<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsta.1911.0009">1</a>] is to combine linearly two iterates taken at two different values of \(k\) so that the zero-th order term \(x_\ast\) is left unchanged, but the first order term in \(1/k\) cancels out. For \(k\) even, we can consider $$  2 x_k – x_{k/2} =  2 \Big( x_\ast + \frac{1}{k} \Delta  +O\Big(\frac{1}{k^2}\Big)  \Big) \, – \Big( x_\ast +  \frac{2}{k} \Delta  + O\Big(\frac{1}{k^2}\Big) \Big)  =  x_\ast +O\Big(\frac{1}{k^2}\Big).$$</p>

<p class="justify-text">The key benefit of Richardson extrapolation is that we only need to know that the leading term in the asymptotic expansion is proportional to \(1/k\), <em>without the need to know the vector \(\Delta\)</em>. See an illustration below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="332" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/richardson_2d.gif" class="wp-image-2481" height="280" />Richardson extrapolation in two dimensions. The sequence is of the form \(x_k = \frac{1}{k} \Delta_1 + \frac{(-1)^k}{k^2} \Delta_2\). The extrapolated sequence \(2 x_k – x_{k/2}\) is only plotted for \(k\) even.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, following [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>], I will explore situations where Richardson extrapolation can be useful within machine learning. I identified three situations where Richardson extrapolation can be useful (there are probably more):</p>



<ol class="justify-text"><li>Iterates of an optimization algorithms \((x_k)_{k \geq 0}\), and the extrapolation is \( 2x_k – x_{k/2}.\)</li><li>Extrapolation on the step-size of stochastic gradient descent, where we will combine iterates obtained from two different values of the step-size.</li><li>Extrapolation on a regularization parameter.</li></ol>



<p class="justify-text">As we will show, extrapolation techniques come with no significant loss in performance, but in several situations strong gains. It is thus “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences">unreasonably effective</a>“.</p>



<h2>Application to optimization algorithms</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider an iterate \(x_k\) of an iterative optimization algorithm which is minimizing a function \(f\), thus converging to a global minimizer \(x_\ast\) of \(f\). Then so is \(x_{k/2}\), and thus also $$  x_k^{(1)} = 2x_k – x_{k/2}.$$ Therefore, performance is never significantly deteriorated (the risk is essentially to lose half of the iterations). The potential gains depend on the way \(x_k\) converges to \(x_\ast\). The existence of a convergence rate of the form \(f(x_k) -f(x_\ast) = O(1/k)\) or \(O(1/k^2)\) is not enough, as Richardson extrapolation requires a specific direction of asymptotic convergence. As illustrated below, some algorithms are oscillating around their solutions, while some converge with a specific direction. Only the latter ones can be accelerated with Richardson extrapolation, while the former ones are good candidates for <a href="https://francisbach.com/acceleration-without-pain/">Anderson acceleration</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="476" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nonoscillating_oscillating-1024x350.png" class="wp-image-2395" height="162" /> Left: Oscillating convergence, where Richardson extrapolation does not lead to any gain. Right: non-oscillating  convergence, with a main direction \(\Delta\) (in red dotted), where Richardson extrapolation can be beneficial if the oscillations orthogonal to the direction \(\Delta\) are negligible compared to convergence along the direction \(\Delta\). </figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Averaged gradient descent.</strong> We consider the usual gradient descent algorithm $$x_k = x_{k-1} – \gamma f'(x_{k-1}),$$ where \(\gamma &gt; 0 \) is a step-size, with Polyak-Ruppert averaging [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/0330046">4</a>]: $$ y_k = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} x_i.$$ Averaging is key to robustness to potential noise in the gradients [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/0330046">4</a>, <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/070704277">5</a>]. However it comes with the unintended consequence of losing the exponential forgetting of initial conditions for strongly-convex problems [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4316-non-asymptotic-analysis-of-stochastic-approximation-algorithms-for-machine-learning.pdf">6</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">A common way to restore exponential convergence (up to the noise level in the stochastic case) is to consider “tail-averaging”, that is, to replace \(y_k\) by the average of only the latest \(k/2\) iterates [<a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-595/16-595.pdf">7</a>]. As shown below for \(k\) even, this corresponds exactly to Richardson extrapolation on the sequence \((y_k)_k\): $$ \frac{2}{k} \sum_{i=k/2}^{k-1} x_i = \frac{2}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} x_i – \frac{2}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k/2-1} x_i = 2 y_k – y_{k/2}. $$</p>



<p class="justify-text">With basic  assumptions on \(f\), it is shown in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>] that for locally strongly-convex problems: $$y_k = x_\ast + \frac{1}{k} \Delta + O(\rho^k), $$ where  \(\displaystyle \Delta = \sum_{i=0}^\infty (x_i – x_\ast)\) and \(\rho \in (0,1)\) depends on the condition number of \(f”(x_\ast)\). This is illustrated below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="342" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/averaged_gradient.png" class="wp-image-2507" height="250" />Averaged gradient descent on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic regression</a> problem in dimension \(d=400\), and with \(n=4000\) observations. For the regular averaged recursion, the line in the log-log plot has slope \(-2\). See experimental details in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>].</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We can make the following observations:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>Before Richardson extrapolation, the asymptotic convergence rate after averaging is of order \(O(1/k^2)\), which is better than the usual \(O(1/k)\) upper-bound for the rate of gradient descent, but with a stronger assumption that in fact leads to exponential convergence before averaging.</li><li>While \(\Delta\) has a simple expression, it cannot be computed in practice (but Richardson extrapolation does not need to know it).</li><li>Richardson extrapolation leads to an exponentially convergent algorithm from an algorithm converging asymptotically in \(O(1/k^2)\).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Accelerated gradient descent.</strong> Above, we considered averaged gradient descent, which is asymptotically converging as \(O(1/k^2)\), and on which Richardson extrapolation could be used with strong gains. Is it possible also for the accelerated gradient descent method [<a href="http://www.mathnet.ru/php/getFT.phtml?jrnid=dan&amp;paperid=46009&amp;what=fullt&amp;option_lang=eng">8</a>], which has a (non-asymptotic) convergence rate of \(O(1/k^2)\) for convex functions?</p>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out that the behavior of the iterates of accelerated gradient descent is exactly of the form depicted in the left plot of the figure above: that is, the iterates \(x_k\) oscillate around the optimum [<a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume17/15-084/15-084.pdf">9</a>, <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v40/Flammarion15.pdf">10</a>], and Richardson extrapolation is of no help, but is not degrading performance too much. See below for an illustration. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="332" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/accelerated_gradient.png" class="wp-image-2509" height="243" />Accelerated gradient descent on a quadratic optimization problem in dimension \(d=1000\). See experimental details in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>].  </figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Other algorithms.</strong> It is tempting to test it on other optimization algorithms. For example, as explained in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>], Richardson extrapolation can be used to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank%E2%80%93Wolfe_algorithm">Frank-Wolfe</a> algorithm, where sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn’t. Others could be tried.</p>



<h2>Extrapolation on the step-size of stochastic gradient descent</h2>



<p class="justify-text">While above we have focused on Richardson extrapolation applied to the number of iterations of an iterative algorithm, it is most often used in integration methods (for computing integrals or solving ordinary differential equations), and then often referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romberg%27s_method">Romberg-Richardson extrapolation</a>. Within machine learning, in a similar spirit, this can be applied to the step-size of stochastic gradient descent [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06386">3</a>, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6514-stochastic-gradient-richardson-romberg-markov-chain-monte-carlo.pdf">11</a>], which I now describe.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We consider the minimization of a function \(F(x)\) defined on \(\mathbb{R}^d\), which can be written as an expectation as $$F(x) = \mathbb{E}_{z} f(x,z).$$ We assume that we have access to \(n\) independent and identically distributed observations (i.i.d.) \(z_1,\dots,z_n\). This is a typical scenario in machine learning, where \(f(x,z)\) represents the loss for the predictor parameterized by \(x\) on the observation \(z\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">The stochastic gradient method is particularly well adapted, and we consider here a single pass, as $$x_i= x_{i-1} – \gamma f'(x_{i-1},z_i),$$ where the gradient is taken with respect to the first variable, for \(i = 1,\dots,n\). It is known that with a constant step-size, when \(n\) tends to infinity, \(x_n\) will <em>not</em> converge to the minimizer \(x_\ast\) of \(F\), as the algorithm always moves [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/0324039">16</a>], as illustrated below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="403" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/logistic_2d-1.gif" class="wp-image-2488" height="279" />Stochastic gradient descent on a logistic regression problem: (blue) without averaging, (red) with averaging.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">One way to damp the oscillations is to consider averaging, that is, $$ y_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i$$ (we consider uniform averaging for simplicity). For least-squares regression, this leads to a converging algorithm [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4900-non-strongly-convex-smooth-stochastic-approximation-with-convergence-rate-o1n.pdf">12</a>] with attractive properties for ill-conditioned problems (see also <a href="https://francisbach.com/the-sum-of-a-geometric-series-is-all-you-need/">January’s blog post</a>). However, for general loss functions, it is shown in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06386">3</a>] that \(y_n\) converges to some \(y^{(\gamma)} \neq x_\ast\). There is a bias due to a step-size \(\gamma\) that does not go to zero. In order to apply Richardson extrapolation, together with Aymeric Dieuleveut and Alain Durmus [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06386">3</a>], we showed that $$ y^{(\gamma)} = x_\ast + \gamma \Delta + O(\gamma^2),$$ for some \(\Delta \in \mathbb{R}^d\) with some complex expression. Thus, we have $$2 y^{(\gamma)} – y^{(2\gamma)} = x_\ast + O(\gamma^2),$$ thus gaining one order. If we consider the iterate \(y_n^{(\gamma)}\) and \(y_n^{(2 \gamma)}\) associated to the two step-sizes \(\gamma\) and \(2 \gamma\), the linear combination $$2 y_n^{(\gamma)} – y_n^{(2\gamma)} $$ has an improved behavior as it tends to \(2 y^{(\gamma)} – y^{(2\gamma)} = x_\ast + O(\gamma^2)\): it remains not convergent, but get to way smaller values. See an illustration below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="359" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SGD_logistic-1.png" class="wp-image-2525" height="274" />Averaged stochastic gradient descent on a logistic regression problem in dimension 20.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Higher-order extrapolation.</strong> If we can accelerate a sequence by extrapolation, why not extrapolate the extrapolated sequence? This is possible if we have an higher-order expansion of the form $$ y^{(\gamma)} = \theta_\ast + \gamma \Delta_1 + \gamma^2 \Delta_2 + O(\gamma^3),$$ for some (typically unknown) vectors \(\Delta_1\) and \(\Delta_2\). Then, the sharp reader can check that $$3 y_n^{(\gamma)} – 3 y_n^{(2\gamma)} +  y_n^{(3\gamma)}, $$ will lead to cancellation of the first two orders \(\gamma\) and \(\gamma^2\). This is illustrated above for SGD.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Then, why not extrapolate the extrapolation of the extrapolated sequence? One can check that $$4 y_n^{(\gamma)} – 6 y_n^{(2\gamma)} + 4  y_n^{(3\gamma)}  -y_n^{(4\gamma)}, $$ will lead to cancellation of the first three orders of an expansion of \(y^{(\gamma)}\). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient">binomial coefficient</a> aficionados have already noticed the pattern there, and checked that $$ \sum_{i=1}^{m+1} (-1)^{i-1} { m+1 \choose i} y_n^{(i\gamma)}$$ will lead to cancellations of the first \(m\) orders.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Then, why not go on forever? First because \(m+1\) recursions have to be run in parallel, and second, because the constant in front of the term in \(\gamma^{m+1}\) typically explodes, a phenomenon common to many expansion methods.</p>



<h2>Extrapolation on a regularization parameter</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now explore the application of Richardson extrapolation to regularization methods. In a nutshell, regularization allows to make an estimation problem more stable (less subject to variations for statistical problems) or the algorithm faster (for optimization problems). However, regularization adds a bias that needs to be removed. In this section, we apply Richardson extrapolation to the regularization parameter to reduce this bias. I will only present an application to smoothing for non-smooth optimization (see an application to  ridge regression in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Non-smooth optimization problems</strong>. We consider the minimization of a convex function of the form \(f = h + g\), where \(h\) is smooth and \(g\) is non-smooth. These optimization problems are ubiquitous in machine learning and signal processing, where the lack of smoothness can come from (a) non-smooth losses such as max-margin losses used in support vector machines and more generally structured output classification [<a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2005/proceedings/papers/113_StructuredPrediction_TaskarEtAl.pdf">13</a>], and (b) sparsity-inducing regularizers (see, e.g., [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/bach_jenatton_mairal_obozinski_FOT.pdf">14</a>] and references therein). While many algorithms can be used to deal with this non-smoothness, we consider a classical smoothing technique below.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Nesterov smoothing</strong>. In this section, we consider the smoothing approach of Nesterov [<a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~sqma/MAT258A_Files/Nesterov-2005.pdf">15</a>] where the non-smooth term is “smoothed” into \(g_\lambda\), where \(\lambda\) is a regularization parameter, and accelerated gradient descent is used to minimize \(h+g_\lambda\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">A typical way of smoothing the function \(g\) is to add \(\lambda\) times a strongly convex regularizer (such as the squared Euclidean norm) to the Fenchel conjugate of \(g\); this leads to a function \(g_\lambda\) which has a smoothness constant (defined as the maximum of the largest eigenvalues of all Hessians) proportional to \(1/\lambda\), with a uniform error of \(O(\lambda)\) between \(g\) and \(g_\lambda\). Given that accelerated gradient descent leads to an iterate with excess function values proportional to \(1/(\lambda k^2)\) after \(k\) iterations, with the choice of \(\lambda \propto 1/k\), this leads to an excess in function values proportional to \(1/k\), which improves on the subgradient method which converges in \(O(1/\sqrt{k})\). Note that the amount of regularization depends on the number of iterations, so that this smoothing method is not “anytime”.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Richardson extrapolation.</strong> If we denote by \(x_\lambda\) the minimizer of \(h+g_\lambda\) and \( x_\ast\) the global minimizer of \( f=h+g\), if we can show that \( x_\lambda = x_\ast + \lambda \Delta + O(\lambda^2)\), then \( x^{(1)}_\lambda = 2 x_\lambda – x_{2\lambda} = O(\lambda^2)\) and we can expand \( f(x_\lambda^{(1)})  = f(x_\ast)  + O(\lambda^2)\), which is better than the \(O(\lambda)\) approximation without extrapolation. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Then, given a number of iterations \(k\), with \( \lambda \propto k^{-2/3}\), to balance the two terms \( 1/(\lambda k^2)\) and \( \lambda^2\),  we get an overall convergence rate for the non-smooth problem of \( k^{-4/3}\). </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>\(m\)-step Richardson extrapolation</strong>. Like above for the step-size, we can also consider \(m\)-step Richardson extrapolation \(x_{\lambda}^{(m)}\), which leads to a bias proportional to \(\lambda^{m+1}\). Thus, if we consider \(\lambda \propto 1/k^{2/(m+2)}\), to balance the terms \(1/(\lambda k^2)\) and \(\lambda^{m+1}\), we get an error for the non-smooth problem of \(1/k^{2(m+1)/(m+2)}\), which can get arbitrarily close to \(1/k^2\) when \(m\) gets large. The downsides (like for the extrapolation on the step-size above) are that (a) the constants in front of the asymptotic equivalent may blow up (a classical problem in high-order expansions), and (b) \(m\)-step extrapolation requires running the algorithm \(m\) times (this can be down in parallel). In the experiment below, 3-step extrapolation already brings in most of the benefits.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to experimentally study the benefits of extrapolation, for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)">Lasso</a> optimization problem, and for a series of regularization parameters equal to \(2^{i}\) for \(i\) between \(-18\) and \(1\) (sampled every \(1/5\)), we run accelerated gradient descent on \(h+g_\lambda\) and we plot the value of \(f(x)-f(x_\ast)\) for the various estimates, where for each number of iterations, we minimize over the regularization parameter. This is an oracle version of varying \(\lambda\) as a function of the number of iterations. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">These last two blog posts were dedicated to acceleration techniques coming from numerical analysis. They are cheap to implement, typically do not interfere with the underlying algorithm, and when used in the appropriate situation, can bring in significant speed-ups.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Next month, I will most probably host an invited post by my colleague <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~ataylor/">Adrien Taylor</a>, who will explain how machines can <s>replace</s> help researchers that prove bounds on optimization algorithms.</p>

<p>The first Foundations of Data Science virtual talk will take place this coming Friday, February 28th at 11:00 AM Pacific Time (2:00 pm Eastern Time, 20:00 Central European Time, 19:00 UTC). <strong>Jon Kleinberg</strong> from Cornell University will speak about “<em>Fairness and Bias in Algorithmic Decision-Making</em>”.</p>



<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: As data science has broadened its scope in recent years, a number of domains have applied computational methods for classification and prediction to evaluate individuals in high-stakes settings. These developments have led to an active line of recent discussion in the public sphere about the consequences of algorithmic prediction for notions of fairness and equity. In part, this discussion has involved a basic tension between competing notions of what it means for such classifications to be fair to different groups. We consider several of the key fairness conditions that lie at the heart of these debates, and in particular how these properties operate when the goal is to rank-order a set of applicants by some criterion of interest, and then to select the top-ranking applicants. The talk will be based on joint work with Sendhil Mullainathan and Manish Raghavan.</p>

<p class="justify-text">I don’t know of any user of iterative algorithms who has not complained one day about their convergence speed. Whether the data are too big, the processors not fast or numerous enough, waiting for an algorithm to converge unfortunately remains a core practical component of computer science and applied mathematics. This was already a concern long before computers were invented (and most of the techniques I will describe date back to the early 19th century): imagine you are doing all the operations (multiplications, additions, divisions) by hand, wouldn’t you want some cheap way to accelerate your algorithm (and here literally reduce your pain)?</p>



<p class="justify-text">Acceleration is a key concept in numerical analysis and can be carried through in two main ways. The first way is to modify some steps of the algorithm (such as Nesterov acceleration for gradient descent, or <a href="https://francisbach.com/chebyshev-polynomials/">Chebyshev</a> / <a href="https://francisbach.com/jacobi-polynomials/">Jacobi</a> acceleration for linear recursions). This requires a good knowledge of the inner structure of the underlying algorithm. A second way is to totally ignore the specifics of the algorithm, and see the acceleration problem as trying to find good “combinations” of the observed iterates that converge faster.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I thus consider a sequence of iterates \((x_k)_{k \geq 0}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) obtained from an iterative algorithm \(x_{k+1} = T(x_k)\), which will typically be an optimization algorithm. The main question I will address is: Can we do better than outputting the last iterate?</p>



<p class="justify-text">This has a long history in numerical analysis, where many techniques have been developed for uni-dimensional sequences. Acceleration techniques vary according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_convergence">type of convergence</a> of the original sequence (quadratic, linear, sublinear), the amount of knowledge about the asymptotic behavior, and the possibility of extensions to high-dimensional and noisy problems.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Acceleration techniques are often based on an explicit or implicit modelling of the sequence \(x_k\), either through a model of the function \(T: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d\) (the iteration of the algorithm) or through an asymptotic expansion of \(x_k\). In this post, I will focus on linearly convergent sequences, that is, sequences \(x_k\) converging to some \(x_\ast\) at an exponential rate. As we will see, this will done through modelling \(x_k\) as an autoregressive process.</p>



<p class="justify-text">I will first start from the simplest scheme, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitken%27s_delta-squared_process">Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\) process</a> from 1926 [1], then look at higher order generalizations still in one dimension, and finally to the general vector case. We will then apply all that to gradient descent.</p>



<h2>Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\) process</h2>



<p class="justify-text">This is the simplest of all techniques and the source of all others in this post. We try to model \(x_k\in \mathbb{R}\) as first-order auto-regressive sequence, that is, \(x_{k+1} = ax_{k}+b\), for \(a,b \in \mathbb{R}\). The method works by (a) estimating \(a\) and \(b\) from a sequence of few consecutive (here three) iterates, and (b) extrapolating by computing the limit \(x_{\rm acc}\) of the estimated model. Given that we fit the model to consecutive iterates \((x_k,x_{k+1},x_{k+2})\), the model \((a,b)\) will also depend on \(k\), as well as its limit \(x_{\rm acc}\). In order to avoid having too many \(k\)’s in my notations, I will drop the dependence in \(k\) of the model parameters.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this situation, the model recursion has a limit when \(a \neq 1\), and the limit is \(x_{\rm acc} =  \frac{b}{1-a}\). In order to fit the two parameters, we need two equations, which can be obtained by considering two consecutive evaluations of the recursions (which require three iterates). That is, we consider the linear system in \((a,b)\): $$ \Big\{ \begin{array}{ll} ax_{k}+b  &amp; = x_{k+1} \\    ax_{k+1}+b &amp; = x_{k+2} \end{array}$$ which can be solved in a variety of ways. All of them are equivalent, but naturally lead to different extensions.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Solving by elimination.</strong> We can eliminate \(b\) by subtracting the two equations, leading to $$ x_{k+2}  – x_{k+1} = a ( x_{k+1} – x_{k}),$$  and thus $$a = \frac{ x_{k+2}  – x_{k+1}}{ x_{k+1} – x_{k}}.$$ We then get $$b = x_{k+1} – a x_{k} = x_{k+1} –  \frac{ x_{k+2}  – x_{k+1}}{ x_{k+1} – x_{k}} x_{k} =  \frac{  x_{k+1}^2 – x_{k} x_{k+2}}{ x_{k+1} – x_{k}}, $$ and the extrapolating sequence $$x_{\rm acc} = \frac{b}{1-a} = \frac{x_{k} x_{k+2} – x_{k+1}^2 }{-2 x_{k+1} + x_{k+2} + x_{k}},$$ which we denote \(x^{(1)}_k\), to highlight its dependence on \(k\). Note that to compute \(x^{(1)}_k\), we need access to the three iterates \((x_k,x_{k+1},x_{k+2})\), and thus, when comparing the original sequence to the extrapolated one, we will compare \(x_k\) and \(x^{(1)}_{k-2}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Asymptotic auto-regressive model</strong>. A key feature of the acceleration techniques that I describe in this post is that although they implicitly or explicitly model sequence with auto-regressive processes, the models do not need to be correct, that is, they also work if the autoregressive recursion is true only asymptotically, for example \(\displaystyle \frac{x_{k+1}-x_\ast}{x_k – x_\ast}\) converging to a constant \(a \in [-1,1)\). Then we also get some acceleration, which can be quantified (see the end of the post for details), and for which we present a classical example below.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Approximating \(\pi\).</strong> We consider the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80">Leibniz formula</a>, which is one of many ways of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximations_of_%CF%80">approximating \(\pi\)</a>: $$ \pi = \lim_{k \to +\infty} x_k  \mbox{ with } x_k = 4 \sum_{i=0}^{k} \frac{(-1)^i}{2i+1}.$$ This formula can be proved by expanding the derivative \(x \mapsto \frac{1}{1+x^2}\) of \(x \mapsto \arctan x\) as a power series and then integrating it. We can check that $$\frac{x_{k+1}-x_\ast}{x_k – x_\ast} =  \ – 1 + \frac{1}{k} + o( \frac{1}{k}), $$ and as detailed at the end of the post, we should expect the error to go from \(1/k\) to \(1/k^3\).  Below, we show the first 10 iterates of the two sequences, with the correct significant digits in bold. $$ \begin{array}{|l|l|l|} \hline k &amp; x_k &amp;  x_k^{(1)} \\ \hline  1  &amp;   4.0000   &amp;  \times \\      2  &amp;  2.6667     &amp;    \times \\  3  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.4667   &amp; \mathbf{3.1}667 \\   4 &amp;   2.8952  &amp;  \mathbf{3.1}333 \\     5  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.3397  &amp;  \mathbf{3.14}52 \\  6 &amp;   2.9760 &amp;   \mathbf{3.1}397 \\   7  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.2837  &amp;  \mathbf{3.14}27 \\   8  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.0171  &amp;  \mathbf{3.14}09 \\  9  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.2524  &amp;  \mathbf{3.14}21 \\   10  &amp;  \mathbf{3}.0418 &amp;  \mathbf{3.141}3 \\ \hline \end{array}$$ We see that the extrapolated sequence converges much faster. This is confirmed in the convergence plot below:</p>

Notice the improvement from \(O(1/k)\) to \(O(1/k^3)\).</figure></div>



<h2>Higher-order one-dimensional extensions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\) process relies on fitting a first-order auto-regressive model, or on assuming that \(x_{k+1} – x_\ast – a (x_k – x_\ast) \to 0\) asymptotically. This can be extended to \(m\)-th order constant recursions. This corresponds to modelling \(x_k\) as the sum of \(m\) exponentials.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We thus try to fit the model $$x_{k+m} = a_0 x_k + a_1 x_{k+1} + \cdots + a_{m-1} x_{k+m-1} + b = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} a_i x_{k+i} + b, $$ which has \(m+1\) parameters. We thus need \(m + 1\) equations, that is we consider the recursion for \(k, k+1,\dots, k+m\), which requires the knowledge of the \(2m+1\) iterates \(x_k, x_{k+1},\dots,x_{k+2m}\). This leads to the \(m+1\) equations: $$x_{k+m+j} = a_0 x_{k+j} + a_1 x_{k+j+1} + \cdots + a_{m-1} x_{k+j+m-1} + b = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} a_i x_{k+j+i} + b,$$ for \(j \in \{0,\dots,m\}\). This is a system with \(m+1\) unknowns and \(m+1\) equations, from which we could get all \(a_j\)’s and \(b\), and then the model limit as the extrapolated sequence \(x^{(m)}_k = \frac{b}{1 – a_0 – a_1 – \cdots – a_{m-1}}\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">This linear system can be solved in a variety of ways. At the end of the blog post, I show how it can be solved using determinants of Hankel-like matrices, often referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanks_transformation">Shanks transformation</a>, which then leads to an iterative algorithm dating back from Wynn [2], which is called the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon_algorithme">\(\varepsilon\)-algorithm</a>. In order to smooth our way to the vector case extension, I will present it in a slightly non-standard way. See [3] for a detailed survey on acceleration and extrapolation.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Instead of learning the model parameters to estimate \(x_{k+m}\) from the past iterates, we focus directly on the prediction of the limit \(x_{\rm acc}\) by looking for real numbers \(c_0,\dots,c_m\) such that for all \(k\), $$\sum_{i=0}^m c_i ( x_{k+i} – x_{\rm acc} ) = 0,$$ with the arbitrary normalization \(\sum_{i=0}^m c_i = 1\). The \(c_i\)’s can be obtained from the \(a_i\)’s and \(b\) as \((c_0,c_1,\dots,c_{m-1},c_m)\propto (a_0,a_1,\dots,a_{m-1},-1)\). We then have $$x_{\rm acc} = \sum_{i=0}^m c_{i} x_{k+i}.$$ Again, the parameters \(c_i\)’s depend on \(k\), but we omit this dependence.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to estimate the \(m+1\) parameters \(c_0,\dots,c_m\), we subtract two versions of the equality for \(k\) and \(k+1\), leading to $$\sum_{i=0}^m c_i ( x_{k+1+i} – x_{k+i} ) = 0.$$ Defining the matrix \(U \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times (m+1)}\) by $$U_{ji} = x_{k+1+i+j} – x_{k+i+j},$$ for \(i \in \{0,\dots,m\}\) and \(j \in \{0,\dots,m-1\}\), we have $$ U c = 0. $$ Together with the constraint \(1_{m+1}^\top c = 1\), this leads to the correct number of equations to estimate \(c\), from \(2m+1\) iterates \(x_k,\dots,x_{k+2m}\). The extrapolated iterate \(x^{(m)}_k\) is then $$x^{(m)}_k = x_{\rm acc} =   \sum_{i=0}^m c_{i} x_{k+i}.$$ Note that the extrapolation is exact when the sequence is exactly following a \(m\)-th order recursion. See an example of application on the Leibniz formula below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="424" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/shanks_Uc.png" class="wp-image-2320" height="330" />Higher-order acceleration through the Shanks transformation for the Leibniz formula. Acceleration is possible only up to machine precision.</figure></div>



<h2>Extension to vectors</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now consider accelerating vector sequences \(x_k \in \mathbb{R}^d\). There are multiple approaches to extend acceleration from real numbers to vectors, as presented in [4, 5]. The simplest way is to apply high-order extrapolation to all coordinates separately (which is often called the vector \(\varepsilon\)-algorithm [10]); this depends however a lot on the chosen basis, requires too many linear systems to solve, and performs worse (see examples below for gradient descent). We now present a vector extension which exists under many names: the Eddy-Mesina method [6,7], reduced rank extrapolation [4, 11, 12], or Anderson acceleration [8]. </p>



<p class="justify-text">We want to model the sequence \(x_k \in \mathbb{R}^d\) as $$x_{k+1} = A x_{k} + b,$$ where \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}\) and \(b \in \mathbb{R}^d\). By a simple variable / equation counting arguments, there are \(d^2+d\) parameters, and we thus need \(d+1\) equations in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), and thus \(d+2\) consecutive iterates, to estimate \(A\) and \(b\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to use only \(m+2\) iterates, with \(m \) much less than \(d\), we will focus directly on the extrapolation equation $$x_{\rm acc} = c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1}+  \cdots +c_m x_{k+m}, $$ with the constraint that \(c_0+c_1+\cdots+c_m =1\). Therefore, we will not try to explicitly fit the model parameters \(A\) and \(b\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">A sufficient condition for good extrapolation weights is that the extrapolated version is close for two consecutive \(k\)’s, that is $$c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1}+  \cdots +c_m x_{k+m} \approx c_0 x_{k+1} + c_1 x_{k+2}+  \cdots +c_m x_{k+m+1},$$ which can be rewritten as $$c_0 (x_{k}-x_{k+1}) + c_1 ( x_{k+1} -x_{k+2}) + \cdots + c_m (x_{k+m} – x_{k+m+1}) \approx 0.$$ A natural criterion is thus to minimize the \(\ell_2\)-norm $$ \big\| c_0 \Delta x_{k} + c_1  \Delta x_{k+1} + \cdots + c_m \Delta x_{k+m} \big\|_2 \mbox{ such that } c_0+c_1+\cdots+c_m = 1,$$ where \(\Delta x_{i} = x_{i} -x_{i+1}\). Denoting \(U \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times (m+1)}\) the matrix with columns \(\Delta x_{k}, \dots,  \Delta x_{k+m}\), we need to minimize \(\| U c \|_2\) such that \(c^\top 1_{m+1} = 1\), whose solution is $$ c \propto ( U^\top U)^{-1} 1_{m+1}, \mbox{ that is, } c = \frac{1}{1_{m+1}^\top (U^\top U)^{-1} 1_{m+1}}  ( U^\top U)^{-1} 1_{m+1}.$$ Note that while the weights \(c_0,\dots,c_m\) sum to one, they may be negative, that is, the extrapolated sequence is not always a convex combination (hence the name extrapolation). Moreover, note that unless \(m\) is large enough, the optimal \(U c\) is in general not equal to zero (it is when modelling real sequences, see below).</p>



<p class="justify-text">For \(m=1\), the solution is particularly simple, as we need to minimize $$ \|\Delta x_{k+1}  – c_0 ( \Delta x_{k+1} – \Delta x_k ) \|^2,$$ leading to $$c_0 = \frac{\Delta x_{k+1}^\top ( \Delta x_{k+1} – \Delta x_k )}{ \|  \Delta x_{k+1} – \Delta x_k \|^2} \mbox{ and } c_1 = \frac{\Delta x_{k}^\top ( \Delta x_{k} – \Delta x_{k+1} )}{ \|  \Delta x_{k+1} – \Delta x_k \|^2}.$$ The acute reader can check that when \(d=1\), we recover Aitken’s formula. See an example in two dimensions below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img width="380" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/anderson_2d.gif" class="wp-image-2276" height="319" />Anderson acceleration in two dimensions. The sequence is following an auto-regressive process with a symmetric \(A\) with eigenvalues in \((-1,1)\). Anderson acceleration cancels the oscillation due to the eigenvalue with largest magnitude.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Recovering one-dimensional sequence acceleration.</strong> Given a real sequence \(y_k \in \mathbb{R}\), we can define the vector \(x_k\) in \(\mathbb{R}^m\) as $$x_k = \left( \begin{array}{c} y_k \\  y_{k+1} \\ \vdots \\ y_{k+m-1} \end{array} \right).$$ One can then check that the matrix \(U\) defined for this vector sequence is exactly the same as the matrix \(U\) defined earlier for the real valued sequence. The optimal \(\| Uc \|\) is then equal to zero (which is not the case in general).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>When is it exact?</strong> The derivation I followed is only intuitive, and as for the other acceleration mechanisms, a natural question is: when is it exact? We will consider linear recursions.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Analysis for linear recursions.</strong> Assuming that \(x_{k+1} = A x_{k} + b\) is exact for all \(k \geq 0\), then \(x_k – x_\ast = A^{k} ( x_0 – x_\ast)\), and thus, following [13], $$\sum_{i=0}^m c_i (x_{k+i}-x_{k+i+1}) = \sum_{i=0}^m c_i A^{i} A^{k}(I – A )(x_0 -x_\ast) = P_m(A)(I – A) A^{k}(x_0 -x_\ast) ,$$ for \(P_m(\sigma)  =  \sum_{i=0}^m c_i \sigma^{i}\) a \(m\)-th order polynomial such that \(P_m(1) = 1\). We can write \(Uc\)  as $$ Uc = P_m(A) ( x_k – x_{k+1}) = ( I – A)  P_m(A)  (x_k – x_\ast) .$$ The error between the true limit and the extrapolation is equal to: $$  x_\ast – \sum_{i=0}^m c_i x_{k+i} = \sum_{i=0}^m c_i ( x_\ast – x_{k+i}  ) = P_m(A) (   x_\ast -x_{k}) = (I-A)^{-1} Uc.$$ Thus, we have $$ \Big\| x_\ast – \sum_{i=0}^m c_i x_{k+i} \Big\|_2 \leq \| U c \|_2 \times  \|(I – A)^{-1}\|_{\rm op} \leq \|(I – A)^{-1}\|_{\rm op}  \|I – A\|_{\rm op} \|P_m(A) ( x_k – x_\ast)\|.  $$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The method will be exact when one can find a degree \(m\) polynomial so that \(P_m(A) (x_{k} – x_\ast) = 0 \), and a sufficient condition is that \(P_m(A)=0\), which is only possible if \(A\) had only \(m\) distinct eigenvalues. This is exactly minimal polynomial extrapolation [9]. Another situation is when \(m = d\) (like for the special case of real sequences above). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Otherwise, the method will be inexact, but the method can find a good polynomial \(P_m\), and the error is less than the infimum of \( \|P_m(A) ( x_k – x_\ast)\|\) over all polynomial of degree \(m\) such that \(P_m(1)=1\). Assuming that the matrix \(A\) is symmetric and with all eigenvalues between \(-\rho\) and \(\rho\) (which will be the case for the gradient method below), then the error is less than the infimum of \(\sup_{\sigma \in [-\rho,\rho]} |P_m(\sigma)|\),  which is attained for the Chebyshev polynomial (see a <a href="https://francisbach.com/chebyshev-polynomials/">previous post</a>). The improvement in terms of convergence is similar to Chebyshev acceleration, but (a) without the need to know \(\rho\) in advance (the method is totally adaptive), and (b) with a provable robustness when the iterates deviate from following an autoregressive process (see [13] for details).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Going beyond linear recursions. </strong>As presented, Anderson acceleration does not lead to stable acceleration (see the experiment below for gradient descent). The main reason is that when iterates deviate from an autoregressive process, or when the recursion is naturally noisy, the estimation of the parameters \(c\) is unstable, in particular because the matrix \(U^\top U\) which has to be inverted is severely ill-conditioned [14]. In a joint work with Damien Scieur and Alexandre d’Aspremont, we considered regularizing  the estimation of \(c\) by penalizing its \(\ell_2\)-norm. We thus minimize  \( \| U c \|_2^2 + \lambda \| c\|_2^2\) such that \(c^\top 1_{m+1} = 1\), whose solution is $$ c \propto ( U^\top U + \lambda I)^{-1} 1_{m+1}, \mbox{ that is, } c = \frac{1}{1_{m+1}^\top (U^\top U + \lambda I)^{-1} 1_{m+1}}  ( U^\top U +  \lambda I)^{-1} 1_{m+1}.$$ This simple modification leads to theoretical guarantees for non-linear recursions, and I will refer to it as regularized non-linear acceleration (RNA, see [13] for details; the “non-linearity” comes from the non-linear dependence of \(c\) on the iterates).</p>



<h2>Application to gradient descent</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We can apply RNA to the recursion, $$x_{k+1}  = x_k – \gamma \nabla f(x_k),$$ where \(f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d\) is a differentiable function, and \(\gamma\) a step-size. In the plot below, we consider accelerating gradient descent with \(m\)-th order RNA, with \(m=8\). We compare this acceleration with applying RNA to each variable separately (“RNA-univ.”), and to the unregularized version (“Anderson”). We can see the benefits of our simple extrapolation steps, and in particular the instability of unregularized acceleration.</p>

We compare regular gradient descent, to plain Anderson acceleration (with no regularization), RNA [13] applied to each variable separately, and RNA. All accelerations are with order \(m =8\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">In order to obtain stronger benefits from non-linear acceleration, several extensions are considered in [13]; in particular line search to find the good regularization parameter \(\lambda\) is quite useful. Another interesting extension is the <em>online</em> version of the algorithm [16, section 2.5], where the extrapolated sequence is used directly within the acceleration procedure, and not as a separate sequence with no interaction with the original gradient method: this corresponds to using RNA to accelerate iterates coming from RNA!</p>



<p class="justify-text">Moreover, while the simplest theoretical guarantees come for deterministic convex optimization problems and gradient descent, RNA can be extended to stochastic algorithms [15] and to non-convex optimization problems such as the ones encountered in deep learning [16].</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I described acceleration techniques that combine iterates of an existing algorithm, without the need to understand finely the inner structure of the original algorithm. They come at little extra-cost and can provide strong benefits.</p>



<p class="justify-text">This month’s post was dedicated to algorithms which converge linearly, that is, the iterates are asymptotically equivalent to sums of exponentials. Next month, I will consider situations where the convergence is sublinear, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson_extrapolation">Richardson extrapolation</a> excels.</p>

<h2>Asymptotic analysis for Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\) process</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In one dimension, we do not need the auto-regressive model to be exact, and an asymptotic analysis is possible. The asymptotic condition corresponds to \(\displaystyle \frac{x_{k+1}-x_\ast}{x_k – x_\ast}\) converging to a constant \(a \in [-1,1)\). More precisely if $$\frac{x_{k+1}-x_\ast}{x_k – x_\ast} = a + \varepsilon_{k+1},$$ with \(\varepsilon_k\) tending to zero, then we can estimate \(a\) through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitken%27s_delta-squared_process">Aitkens \(\Delta^2\) method</a> [1] as, $$ a_{k+1} = \frac{x_{k+1}-x_k}{x_{k}-x_{k-1}} = \frac{(x_{k+1}-x_\ast) – (x_k-x_\ast) }{(x_{k} – x_\ast) -( x_{k-1}-x_\ast) } = \frac{ a + \varepsilon_{k+1} – 1}{1 – 1/(a+\varepsilon_{k})} = a + \varepsilon_{k+1} + o( \varepsilon_{k+1}).$$ A closer Taylor expansion leads to $$ a + \varepsilon_{k} + \frac{1}{a-1}( \varepsilon_{k+1}- \varepsilon_{k}) + O(\varepsilon_{k}^2).$$ We can then provide a better estimate of \(x_\ast\) as $$ \frac{x_{k+1} – a_{k+1}x_k}{1- a_{k+1}} = x_\ast + \frac{x_{k+1} -x_\ast – a_{k+1}( x_k-x_\ast)}{1- a_{k+1}} = x_\ast + \frac{(a+\varepsilon_{k+1}-a_{k+1}) ( x_k – x_\ast)}{1-a_{k+1}},$$ whose difference with \(x_\ast\) is equivalent to $$ \frac{(a+\varepsilon_k-a_{k+1}) ( x_k – x_\ast)}{1-a }  \sim \frac{\varepsilon_{k+1}- \varepsilon_{k}}{(1-a)^2} ( x_k – x_\ast).$$ We have thus provided an acceleration of order \(\displaystyle \frac{\varepsilon_{k+1}- \varepsilon_{k}}{(1-a)^2} \).</p>



<h2>High-order Shanks transformation</h2>



<p>In order to relate our formulas to classical expressions, we first rewrite the recursion for \(m=1\) and then \(m=2\), and then to general \(m\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>First-order recursion (Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\)).</strong> We write the autorecursive recursion as $$ (x_{k+1} – x_\ast) = a ( x_{k} – x_\ast) \Leftrightarrow c_0(x_k – x_\ast) + c_1 (x_{k+1}-x_\ast) = 0 ,$$ with the constraint \(c_0 + c_1 = 1\), that is, \(c_0 = \frac{-a}{1-a}\) and \(c_1 = \frac{1}{1-a}\). We can then write \(x_\ast = c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1}\), and we have the linear system in \((c_0,c_1,x_\ast)\): $$  \left( \begin{array}{ccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ x_k &amp; x_{k+1} &amp; – 1  \end{array}\right)  \left( \begin{array}{c} c_0 \\ c_1 \\ x_\ast  \end{array}\right) =  \left( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right), $$ which can be solved using Cramer’s formula $$x_{\rm acc} = x_\ast = \frac{\left| \begin{array}{cc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2}  \\ x_{k} &amp; x_{k+1} \end{array}\right|}{\left| \begin{array}{cc}  x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2}  \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{array}\right|},$$  which leads to the same formula for \(x^{(1)}_k\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Second-order recursion.</strong> Here, we only consider the case \(m=2\) for simplicity. We consider the model, $$c_0 (x_k – x_\ast) + c_1 (x_{k+1} – x_\ast)+ c_{2} (x_{k+2} – x_\ast) = 0, $$ with the normalization \(c_0 + c_1 + c_2 = 1\). We can then extract \(x_\ast\) as $$ x_\ast = c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1} +  c_2 x_{k+2}.$$ In order to provide the extra \(2\) equations that are necessary to estimate the three parameters, we take first order differences and get $$c_0 (x_k -x_{k+1}) + c_1 (x_{k+1}-x_{k+2}) +  c_2 ( x_{k+2} – x_{k+3} ) =0,$$ for \(k\) and \(k+1\). This leads to the linear system in \((c_0,c_1, c_2, x_\ast)\): $$  \left( \begin{array}{cccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2} – x_{k+3} &amp; 0 \\  x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2}-x_{k+3} &amp;  x_{k+3} – x_{k+4} &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0  \\ x_{k} &amp; x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+2} &amp;  – 1  \end{array}\right)  \left( \begin{array}{c} c_0 \\ c_1 \\ c_2 \\ x_\ast  \end{array}\right) =  \left( \begin{array}{c}  0  \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right), $$ which can be solved using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramer%27s_rule">Cramer’s rule</a> (and classical manipulations of determinants) as $$x_k^{(2)} = \frac{\left| \begin{array}{ccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2} – x_{k+3}   \\  x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2}-x_{k+3} &amp;  x_{k+3} – x_{k+4}   \\ x_{k} &amp; x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+2}    \end{array} \right|}{\left| \begin{array}{ccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2} – x_{k+3}     \\ x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2}-x_{k+3} &amp;  x_{k+3} – x_{k+4}   \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp;  \end{array} \right|}.$$  </p>



<p class="justify-text">The formula extends to order \(m\) (see below) and is often called the Shanks transformation; it is cumbersome and not easy to use. However, the coefficients can be computed recursively (which is to be expected for a Hankel matrix, but rather tricky to derive), through Wynn’s \(\varepsilon\)-algorithm.  See [3] for a survey on acceleration and extrapolation.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Higher-order recursion.</strong> We consider the model, for \(m \geq 1\), $$c_0 (x_k – x_\ast) + c_1 (x_{k+1} – x_\ast) + \cdots + c_{m} (x_{k+m} – x_\ast) = 0, $$ with the normalization \(c_0 + c_1 + \cdots + c_m = 1\). We can then extract \(x_\ast\) as $$ x_\ast = c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1} + \cdots + c_m x_{k+m}.$$ In order to provide the extra \(m\) equations, we take first order differences and get $$c_0 (x_k -x_{k+1}) + c_1 (x_{k+1}-x_{k+2}) + \cdots + c_m ( x_{k+m} – x_{k+m+1} ) =0,$$ for \(k, k+1,\dots, k+m-1\). This leads to the linear system in \((c_0,c_1,\cdots, c_m, x_\ast)\): $$  \left( \begin{array}{ccccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+m} – x_{k+m+1} &amp; 0 \\  x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2}-x_{k+3} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+m+1} – x_{k+m+2} &amp; 0 \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;  &amp; \vdots  &amp; \vdots \\ x_{k+m-1}-x_{k+m} &amp; x_{k+m}-x_{k+m+1} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+2m-1} – x_{k+2m} &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; \dots &amp; 1 &amp; 0  \\ x_{k+m} &amp; x_{k+m+1} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+2m} &amp;  – 1  \end{array}\right)  \left( \begin{array}{c} c_0 \\ c_1 \\ \vdots \\ c_m \\ x_\ast  \end{array}\right) =  \left( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right), $$ which can be solved using Cramer’s formula $$x_\ast = \frac{\left|\begin{array}{cccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+m} – x_{k+m+1} \\  x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2}-x_{k+3} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+m+1} – x_{k+m+2}   \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;  &amp; \vdots  \\ x_{k+m-1}-x_{k+m} &amp; x_{k+m}-x_{k+m+1} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+2m-1} – x_{k+2m} \\ x_{k+m} &amp; x_{k+m+1} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+2m}  \end{array} \right|}{\left|\begin{array}{cccc} x_{k}-x_{k+1} &amp; x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+m} – x_{k+m+1} \\  x_{k+1}-x_{k+2} &amp; x_{k+2}-x_{k+3} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+m+1} – x_{k+m+2}   \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;  &amp; \vdots  \\ x_{k+m-1}-x_{k+m} &amp; x_{k+m}-x_{k+m+1} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{k+2m-1} – x_{k+2m} \\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \end{array}  \right|}.$$  </p>

<p class="justify-text">I sometimes joke with my students about one of the main tools I have been using in the last ten years: the explicit sum of a geometric series. <em>Why is this?</em></p>



<h2>From numbers to operators</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The simplest version of this basic result for real numbers is the following: $$ \forall r \neq 1, \ \forall n \geq 0, \   \sum_{k=0}^n r^k = \frac{1-r^{n+1}}{1-r},$$ and is typically proved by multiplying the two sides by \(1-r\) and forming a telescoping sum. When \(|r|&lt;1\), we can let \(n\) tend to infinity and get $$ \forall |r| &lt;  1, \  \sum_{k=0}^\infty r^k = \frac{1}{1-r}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Proofs without words.</strong> There is a number of classical proofs of the last identities, many of them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_without_words">without words</a>, presented in the beautiful series of books by Roger Nelsen [1, 2, 3]. I particularly like the two below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="478" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/triangles-1-1024x447.png" class="wp-image-1916" height="209" />Proof of the infinite sum of a geometric series with \(r=\frac{1}{2}.\) The area of the right triangle which is the half of a square with side length equal to \(2\), is equal to \(2\) and to the sum of the areas of the smaller triangles, that is, \(2 = \frac{1}{1- \frac{1}{2}}= 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \cdots\). Adapted from [3, p. 155].</figure></div>

Adapted from [1, p. 118].</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>High school: from philosophy to trigonometry.</strong> Before looking at extensions beyond real numbers, I can’t resist mentioning some of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes">Zeno’s paradoxes</a>, like Achilles and the tortoise, which are intimately linked with the sum of a geometric series (and which were a highlight of my high school philosophy “career”).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Speaking of high school, it is interesting to note that there, the core identity of this blog post, is often used as \(a^{n+1}-b^{n+1} = (a-b)(a^n+a^{n-1}b+\cdots+ab^{n-1}+b^{n})\) in order to factorize polynomials (and not in the other way around like done later in this post).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Another nice elementary use of geometric series comes up with complex numbers, in order to compute sum of cosines, such as: $$\! \sum_{k=0}^n \! \cos k\theta = {\rm Re} \Big(\!\sum_{k=0}^n e^{ i k \theta}\!\Big) = {\rm Re} \Big(\!\frac{e^{i(n+1)\theta}-1}{e^{i\theta}-1}\!\Big) =  {\rm Re} \Big(\! \frac{ \sin \frac{n+1}{2} \theta e^{i(n+1)\theta/2}}{ \sin \frac{\theta}{2} e^{i\theta/2} }\!\Big) = \frac{  \sin \frac{n+1}{2} \theta}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} \cos \frac{n\theta}{2}. $$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Square matrices and operators.</strong> Within applied mathematics, the matrix and operator versions are the most useful. For \(A\) a square matrix or any linear operator, we have $$ \forall A \mbox{ such that } I-A \mbox{ is invertible}, \  \sum_{k=0}^n A^k = (I-A)^{-1}(I-A^{n+1}),$$ with the classical proof: \(\displaystyle (I – A)\sum_{k=0}^n A^k = \sum_{k=0}^n A^k – \sum_{k=1}^{n+1} A^k = I – A^{n+1}.\)</p>



<p class="justify-text">When \(\| A\| &lt;1\) for any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm">matrix norm</a> induced from a vector norm, we can let \(n\) go to infinity, to obtain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neumann_series">Neumann series</a> \(\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{+\infty} A^k = (I-A)^{-1}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We are now ready to talk about machine learning and optimization!</p>



<h2>Stochastic gradient for quadratic functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Matrix geometric series come up naturally when analyzing iterative algorithms based on linear recursions. In this blog post, I will focus on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) techniques to solve the following problem: $$ \min_{\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d} F(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E} \big[ y – \theta^\top \Phi(x) \big]^2,$$ where the expectation is taken with respect to some joint distribution on \((x,y)\). We denote by \(\theta_\ast \in \mathbb{R}^d\) the minimizer of the objective function above (which is assumed to exist). We assume the feature vector \(\Phi(x)\) is high-dimensional, so that the moment matrix \(H = \mathbb{E} \big[ \Phi(x)\Phi(x)^\top \big]\) cannot be assumed to be invertible.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Stochastic gradient descent recursion. </strong>Starting from some initial guess \(\theta_0 \in \mathbb{R}^d\), typically \(\theta_0 =0\), the SGD recursion is: $$  \theta_n = \theta_{n-1} – \gamma ( \theta_{n-1}^\top \Phi(x_n) \, – y_n) \Phi(x_n),$$ where \((x_n,y_n)\) is an independent sample from the distribution mentioned above, and \(\gamma &gt; 0\) is the step-size. This algorithm dates back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_approximation">Robbins and Monro</a> in the 50’s and is particularly adapted to machine learning as it updates the parameter \(\theta\) after each observation \((x_n,y_n)\) (as opposed to waiting for a full pass over the data).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Denoting \(\varepsilon_n = y_n – \theta_\ast^\top \Phi(x_n)\) the residual between the observation \(y_n\) and the optimal linear prediction \(\theta_\ast^\top \Phi(x_n)\), we can rewrite the SGD recursion as $$\theta_n = \theta_{n-1} – \gamma ( \theta_{n-1}^\top \Phi(x_n) \, – \theta_{\ast}^\top \Phi(x_n) -\, \varepsilon_n) \Phi(x_n),$$ leading to $$\theta_n \, – \theta_\ast = \big[ I – \gamma \Phi(x_n) \Phi(x_n)^\top \big] ( \theta_{n-1}- \theta_\ast) + \gamma \varepsilon_n \Phi(x_n).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">This is a stochastic linear recursion on the deviation to optimum \(\theta_n \, – \theta_\ast\). The expectation of the SGD recursion is: $$\mathbb{E} [ \theta_n] \, – \theta_\ast = \big[ I – \gamma H \big] ( \mathbb{E}[ \theta_{n-1}] – \theta_\ast), $$ where \(H = \mathbb{E} \big[ \Phi(x) \Phi(x)^\top \big]\), and where we have used that  \(\gamma \varepsilon_n \Phi(x_n)\) has zero expectation (as a consequence of optimality conditions for \(\theta_\ast\)). This is exactly the gradient descent recursion on the expected loss (which cannot be run in practice because we only have access to a finite amount of data).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Simplification. </strong>The main difficulty in analyzing the stochastic recursion is the presence of two sources of randomness when compared to the gradient descent recursion: (A) some additive noise \(\gamma \varepsilon_n \Phi(x_n)\) independent of the current iterate \(\theta_{n-1}\) and with zero expectation, and (B) some multiplicative noise \(\gamma \big[  H – \Phi(x_n) \Phi(x_n)^\top \big] (\theta_{n-1} – \theta_\ast)\), which comes from the use of \(  I – \gamma \Phi(x_n) \Phi(x_n)^\top  \) instead of \(I – \gamma H\), and depends on the current iterate \(\theta_{n-1}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, for simplicity, I will ignore the multiplicative noise and only focus on the additive noise, and thus consider the recursion $$\theta_n\, – \theta_\ast = ( I – \gamma H )  ( \theta_{n-1}- \theta_\ast) + \gamma \varepsilon_n \Phi(x_n).$$ Detailed studies with multiplicative noise can be found in [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4900-non-strongly-convex-smooth-stochastic-approximation-with-convergence-rate-o1n.pdf">4</a>, <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v38/defossez15.pdf">5</a>, <a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-335/16-335.pdf">6</a>, <a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-595/16-595.pdf">7</a>], and lead to similar results. Moreover, I will assume (again for simplicity) that \(\varepsilon_n\) and \(\Phi(x_n)\) are independent, and that \(\mathbb{E} [ \varepsilon_n^2 ] = \sigma^2\) (which corresponds to uniform noise of variance \(\sigma^2\) on top of the optimal linear predictions); again, results directly extends without this assumption.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Bias / variance decomposition. </strong>Having a constant multiplicative term \(I – \gamma H\) in the recursion leads to an explicit formula: $$\theta_n – \theta_\ast = ( I – \gamma H ) ^n ( \theta_{0}- \theta_\ast) + \sum_{k=1}^n \gamma  ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n-k} \varepsilon_k \Phi(x_k),$$ which is now easy to analyze. It is the sum of a deterministic term depending on initial conditions,  and a zero mean term which is the sum of independent zero-mean terms due to the noise in the gradients. Thus, we can compute the expectation of the excess risk \(F(\theta_n)\, – F(\theta_\ast) = \frac{1}{2} ( \theta_n – \theta_\ast)^\top H ( \theta_n – \theta_\ast)\), as follows: $$\! \mathbb{E} \big[ F(\theta_n) \,- F(\theta_\ast)\big] = {\rm Bias} + { \rm Variance}, $$ where the bias term characterizes the forgetting of initial conditions: $$ {\rm Bias} = \frac{1}{2}  ( \theta_0 – \theta_\ast)^\top ( I – \gamma H ) ^{2n} H ( \theta_0 – \theta_\ast),  $$ and the variance term characterizes the effect of the noise: $${\rm Variance} =  \frac{\gamma^2 }{2}\! \sum_{k=1}^n \! \mathbb{E} \big[ \varepsilon_k^2 \Phi(x_k)^\top ( I – \gamma H ) ^{2n-2k}H  \Phi(x_k) \big] = \frac{\gamma^2  \sigma^2}{2}\! \sum_{k=1}^n \! {\rm tr} \big[  ( I – \gamma H ) ^{2n-2k}H^2   \big] .$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The bias term is exactly the convergence rate of gradient descent on the expected risk, and can be controlled by upper-bounding the eigenvalues of the matrix  \(( I – \gamma H ) ^{2n} H\). As shown at the end of the post, when \(\gamma \leq \frac{1}{L}\), where \(L\) is the largest eigenvalue of \(H\), then this matrix has all eigenvalues less than \(1/(4n\gamma)\), leading to a bound on the bias term of $$ \frac{1}{8 \gamma n} \|\theta_0 – \theta_\ast\|^2.$$ We recover the traditional \(O(1/n)\) convergence rate of gradient descent. For the variance term we use the sum of a geometric series, to obtain the bound $$\frac{\gamma^2  \sigma^2}{2}   {\rm tr} \big[ H^2( I – (I – \gamma H)^2 )^{-1}  \big] = \frac{\gamma^2  \sigma^2}{2}  {\rm tr} \big[ H^2( 2\gamma H – \gamma^2 H^2 )^{-1}  \big] \leq \frac{\gamma  \sigma^2}{2}  {\rm tr}(H) .$$ While the bias term that characterizes the forgetting of initial conditions goes to zero as \(n\) goes to infinity, this is not the case for the variance term. This is the traditional lack of convergence of SGD with a constant step-size. In the left plot of the figure below, we compare deterministic gradient descent to stochastic gradient with a constant step-size. For convergence rates in higher dimension, see further below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img width="564" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/paths_video-1.gif" class="wp-image-2039" height="236" />Gradient descent algorithms run from the same starting point. Left plot: plain gradient descent (GD), plain (non-averaged) gradient descent (SGD). Right plot: averaged SGD with uniform weights (ASGD-1) and with weights proportional to the iteration index (ASGD-k).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Convergence can be obtained by using a decreasing step-size, typically of the order \(1 / \sqrt{n},\) leading to an overall convergence rate proportional to \(1 / \sqrt{n}.\) This can be improved through averaging, which I now present.</p>



<h2>Impact of averaging</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider the averaged iterate \(\bar{\theta}_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \sum_{k=0}^n \theta_k\), an off-line (no interaction with the stochastic recursion) averaging often referred to as Polyak–Ruppert averaging, after [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/0330046">8</a>, 9]. The averaged iterate can also be expressed as a linear function of initial conditions and noise variables as $$\bar{\theta}_n -\theta_\ast = \frac{1}{n+1} \sum_{k=0}^n  ( I – \gamma H ) ^k ( \theta_{0}- \theta_\ast) + \frac{\gamma}{n+1}   \sum_{k=1}^n \sum_{j=k}^n   ( I – \gamma H ) ^{j-k} \varepsilon_k \Phi(x_k).$$ Geometric series come in again! We can get a closed form for \(\bar{\theta}_n -\theta_\ast\) as: $$\frac{1}{n+1} (\gamma H)^{-1} \big[ I – ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n+1} \big] ( \theta_{0}- \theta_\ast) + \frac{\gamma}{n+1} (\gamma H)^{-1} \sum_{k=1}^n \big[ I – ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n-k+1} \big] \varepsilon_k \Phi(x_k).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The bound on \(\mathbb{E} \big[ F(\bar{\theta}_n) \,- F(\theta_\ast)\big] \), will here also be composed of a bias term and a variance term. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Bias.</strong> The bias term is equal to $$\frac{1}{2(n+1)^2}( \theta_{0}- \theta_\ast) ^\top   (\gamma H)^{-2} H \big[ I – ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n+1} \big]^2 ( \theta_{0}- \theta_\ast).$$ Using the fact that the eigenvalues of the matrix \( (\gamma H)^{-2} H \big[ I – ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n+1} \big]^2\) are all less than \((n+1)/\gamma\) (see proof at the end of the post), we obtain the upper bound $$ \frac{1}{2 (n+1)\gamma} \| \theta_0 – \theta_\ast\|^2,$$ which is essentially the same than with averaging (but, see an important difference in the discussion below, regarding the behavior for large \(n\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Variance.</strong> The variance term is equal to $$ \frac{\gamma^2}{2 (n+1)^2}  \sum_{k=1}^n \sigma^2 {\rm tr} \Big( \big[ I – ( I – \gamma H ) ^{n-k+1} \big]^2 (\gamma H)^{-2} H^2 \Big).$$ Using the positivity of the matrix \(( I – \gamma H )\), we finally obtain the following bound for variance term: $$  \frac{ \sigma^2 n {\rm tr}(I)}{2(n+1)^2}\leq \frac{\sigma^2 d}{2n}.$$ We now have a convergent algorithm, and we recover traditional quantities from the statistical analysis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares">least-squares regression</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Experiments.</strong> Now, both bias and variance are converging at rate \(1/n\). See an illustration in two dimensions in the right plot of the figure above, as well as a convergence rates below. In these two figures, what differs is the decay of eigenvalues of \(H\) (fast in the first figure, slower in the second).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="533" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/rates_d3-1-1024x453.png" class="wp-image-2029" height="235" />Bias (left) and variance (right) terms for plain SGD, averaged SGD with uniform averaging (ASGD-1) and non-uniform averaging (ASGD-k).

<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="549" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/rates_d-1-1024x453.png" class="wp-image-2030" height="242" />Bias (left) and variance (right) terms for plain SGD, averaged SGD with uniform averaging (ASGD-1) and non-uniform averaging (ASGD-k).

<p>We can make the following observations:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>Depending on the amount of noise in the gradients, the sum of the variance and the bias terms will either be dominated by one of the two; typically the bias term in early iterations, and then the variance term (see more  details in [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v38/defossez15.pdf">5</a>]).</li><li>The variance term of non-averaged SGD is converging to a constant (while the bias term is exactly the one of regular gradient descent).</li><li>With averaging, the variance terms decay as a line in a log-log plot. The reader with good eyes can check that the slope is indeed -1, thus illustrating the convergence rate in \(1/n\) (here the bound is tight). For the variance terms (right plots), there is no significant difference between the two eigenvalue decays.</li><li>The bias terms have different behaviors for the two decays. For the fast decays (top plot), the bounds in \(1/n\) are reasonably tight (lines of slope -1). For slower decay, we see some strong-convexity behavior entering the scene, as the slowest eigenvalue is 1/100 and the number of iterations is far larger than 100, and thus the optimization problem looks strongly convex, and then the bias term of plain SGD (which corresponds to deterministic gradient descent) converges exponentially fast, while the two averaging techniques decay as powers of \(n\) (again, the acute reader can spot slopes of -2 and -4, and the smart reader can explain why; more on this in a future post dedicated to SGD).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Pros and cons of averaging.</strong> Overall, we can see that averaging may slow down the forgetting of initial conditions, while it makes the method robust to noise in the gradients. The trade-off depends on the amount of noise, but in most high-dimensional learning problems and for the accuracies practitioners are interested in (no need to have an excess risk of \(10^{-5}\) then the best risk is of order \(10^{-1}\)), the bias term is the one which is seen the most. Thus, a less-aggressive form of averaging that puts more weights on later iterates seems advantageous (pink curve above). More on this in a future blog post.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Beyond least-squares.</strong> In this blog post, to illustrate the use of sums of geometric series, I have focused on an idealized version (no multiplicative noise) of least-squares regression. For other losses, e.g., logistic loss, the analysis is more involved, and averaging does not lead to a converging algorithm, but transforms a term in \(\gamma\) into a term in \(\gamma^2\), which is still a significant improvement when the step-size \(\gamma\) is small (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06386">10</a>] for more details).</p>



<h3>Extensions</h3>



<p class="justify-text">The sum of a geometric series can be extended in a variety of ways. For example, we can take the derivative with respect to \(r\), to get $$ \forall r \neq 1, \  \sum_{k=1}^n k r^{k-1} = \frac{1-r^{n+1}}{(1-r)^2} – \frac{ (n+1) r^n}{1-r} = \frac{1 + n r^{n+1} – (n+1) r^n }{(1-r)^2}.$$ This is useful for example to compute the performance of the weighted average \(\frac{2}{n(n+1)} \sum_{k=1}^n k \theta_k\). This can be extended further with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_series">binomial series</a> $$ (1-r)^{-1-\beta} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty { k + \beta \choose k} r^k. $$</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I have essentially used the sum of a geometric series as an excuse to talk about stochastic gradient descent, but there are other places where such series pop out, such as in the analysis of Markov chains and the associated ergodic theorems [11], which are ubiquitous in the analysis of simulation algorithms.</p>



<p class="justify-text">This year, I am still planning to post every first Monday of the month. Expect additional posts on acceleration, stochastic gradient, and orthogonal polynomials, but also new topics should be covered, always with connections with machine learning. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Happy new year!</p>

<h2>Detailed computations</h2>



<p><strong>Bounds on eigenvalues – I.</strong> In order to show the first desired inequality on eigenvalues, we simply need to show that \((1-t)^{2n} t \leq 1/(4n)\) for any \(t \in [0,1]\), which is the consequence of $$(1-t)^{2n} t \leq (e^{-t})^{2n} t \leq \frac{1}{2n} \sup_{u \geq 0} e^{-u} u = \frac{1}{2e n} \leq \frac{1}{4n}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Bounds on eigenvalues – II.</strong> In order to show the second desired inequality on eigenvalues, we simply need to show that \(( 1 – ( 1 – t)^{n+1}) \leq \sqrt{n+1} \sqrt{t}\), for any \(t \in [0,1]\). This is a simple consequence of the straightforward inequality \(( 1 – ( 1 – t)^{n+1}) \leq 1\) and the inequality \(( 1 – ( 1 – t)^{n+1}) \leq (n+1) t \), which itself can be obtained by integrating the inequality \((1-u)^n \leq 1\) between \(0\) and \(t\).</p></div>

<p class="justify-text">Following up my last post on Chebyshev polynomials, another piece of polynomial magic this month. This time, Jacobi polynomials will be the main players.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Since definitions and various formulas are not as intuitive as for Chebyshev polynomials, I will start by the machine learning / numerical analysis motivation, which is an elegant refinement of Chebyshev acceleration.</p>



<h2>Spectral measures and polynomial acceleration</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Like in the previous post, we consider the iteration in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) $$x_{k+1} = Ax_{k} – b,$$ with \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) a symmetric matrix with spectrum \({\rm Spec}(A) \subset (-1,1)\), with unique fixed point \(x_\ast\) such that \(x_\ast = A x_\ast – b\), that is, \(x_\ast = ( A – I)^{-1} b\).  These recursions naturally come up in gradient descent for quadratic functions or gossip algorithms (as described later).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to speed-up convergence, a classical idea explored in the <a href="https://francisbach.com/chebyshev-polynomials/">last post</a> is to take linear combinations of all past iterates. That is, we consider \(y_k = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k x_i\) for some weights \(\nu_i^k\) such that \(\sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k=1\) (so that if all iterates are already at \(x_\ast\), then the weighted average stays there). We have $$ y_k – x_\ast =  \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k ( x_i – x_\ast) = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k A^i (x_0-x_\ast) = P_k(A) (x_0-x_\ast),$$ where \(P_k(X) = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k X^i\) is a polynomial such that \(P_k(1)=1\).  </p>



<p class="justify-text">For Chebyshev acceleration, we used the following bound: $$  \frac{1}{n} \| y_k – x_\ast\|_2^2 =   \frac{1}{n} ( x_0 – x_\ast)^\top P_k(A)^2 (x_0 -x_\ast)   \leq \max_{\lambda \in {\rm Spec}(A)} |P_k(\lambda)|^2 \cdot \frac{1}{n}\|x_0 – x_\ast\|_2^2.$$ Using the fact that  \({\rm Spec}(A) \subset [-1\!+\!\delta,1\!-\!\delta]\) for some \(\delta&gt;0\), minimizing \(\max_{\lambda \in {\rm Spec}(A)} |P_k(\lambda)|^2\) subject to \(P_k(1)=1\) led to a rescaled Chebyshev polynomials. This allowed to go from a convergence rate proportional to \((1\!-\!\delta)^k\) to a convergence rate proportional to \((1 – \sqrt{2\delta})^k\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">When \(\delta\) is small, this is a significant gain. But when \(\delta\) is really small, none of the two techniques converge quickly enough, in particular in early iterations where the exponential convergence regime has not been reached. However, only a few eigenvalues are close to \(-1\) or \(1\)  (see examples in gossip matrices below), and using more information about eigenvalues beyond the smallest and largest ones can be advantageous.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="613" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/comparing_spectra-1-1024x266.png" class="wp-image-1600" height="159" />Histogram of eigenvalues of gossip matrices for gossiping within the 1D, 2D and 3D grid, with the same number of nodes \(n = 4096\): the eigengap \(1-\rho\) is small, and the eigenvalues are well-spread. See more details in the gossip section below.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We will use the spectral decomposition \(A = \sum_{i=1}^n\! \lambda_i u_i u_i^\top\), where \(\lambda_i\) is an eigenvalue of \(A\) with orthonormal eigenvectors \(u_i\), \(i=1,\dots,n\). We thus have $$  \frac{1}{n} \| y_k – x_\ast\|_2^2 = \frac{1}{n} ( x_0 – x_\ast)^\top P_k\Big( \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i u_i u_i^\top \Big)^2 ( x_0 – x_\ast) =  \frac{1}{n}\! \sum_{i=1}^n P_k(\lambda_i)^2 \big[ (x_0 – x_\ast)^\top u_i \big]^2.$$ Assuming \(\big[ (x_0 – x_\ast)^\top u_i \big]^2 \leq \tau^2\) for all \(i=1,\dots,n\) (that is, the initial deviation from the optimum has uniform magnitude on all eigenvectors), we need to minimize $$ e(P_k) = \frac{1}{n} \! \sum_{i=1}^n \! P_k(\lambda_i)^2  = \int_{-1}^1 \!\! P_k(\lambda)^2 d \sigma(\lambda)$$ with respect to \(P_k\), where \(d\sigma = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n\! \delta_{\lambda_i}\) is the spectral probability measure of \(A\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Now, the new goal is to minimize \(\displaystyle \int_{-1}^1 \!\! P_k(\lambda)^2 d \sigma(\lambda)\) with respect to a polynomial \(P_k\) with degree \(k\) and such that \(P_k(1)=1\). This is where orthogonal polynomials naturally come in. Their use in creating acceleration mechanisms dates back from numerical analysis in the 1980’s and 1990’s (with a very nice and detailed account in [1]).</p>



<h2>Orthogonal polynomials and kernel polynomials</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider a sequence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_polynomials">orthogonal polynomials</a> \(Q_k\) for the probability measure \(d\sigma\) in support within \([-1,1]\), each of degree \(k\), which we do not assume normalized. They are essentially unique (up to rescaling); see, e.g., the very good books by Gábor Szegő [2] and Theodore Seio Chihara [3].</p>



<p class="justify-text">We denote by \(\alpha_i = \int_{-1}^1 \! Q_i^2(\lambda)d\sigma(\lambda)\), for \(i \geq 0\), the squared norm of \(Q_i\), so that the sequence of polynomials \(({\alpha_i^{-1/2}} Q_i)\) is <em>orthonormal</em>. We can then solve the optimization problem above for \(P_k\), by writing it \(P_k(X) = \sum_{i=0}^k u_i {\alpha_i^{-1/2}} Q_i(X)\), and the problem in \(u \in\mathbb{R}^{k+1}\) becomes: $$\min_{u \in \mathbb{R}^{k+1}} \sum_{i=0}^k u_i^2 \mbox{ such that }  \sum_{i=0}^k u_i {\alpha_i^{-1/2}} Q_i(1) = 1.$$ This optimization problem can be solved in closed form, and the solution is such that \(\displaystyle u_i = \frac{{\alpha_i^{-1/2}} Q_i(1)}{\sum_{j=0}^k \!{\alpha_j^{-1}} Q_j(1)^2}\) for all \(i\), with the optimal polynomial $$P_k(X) =  \frac{\sum_{i=0}^k \! {\alpha_i^{-1}} Q_i(1) Q_i(X) }{\sum_{i=0}^k \!{\alpha_i^{-1}} Q_i(1)^2}.$$ The optimal value is thus equal to $$\big({\sum_{i=0}^k \alpha_i^{-1} Q_i(1)^2 } \big)^{-1}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The polynomials \(\sum_{i=0}^k \alpha_i^{-1} Q_i(X)Q_i(Y)\) are called the <em>kernel polynomials</em> [3, Chapter I, Section 7] associated to \(d\sigma\), and have many properties (beyond the optimality property which we just proved) that we will use below. </p>



<p class="justify-text">At this point, the problem seems essentially solved: one can construct iteratively the polynomials \(Q_k\) using classical second-order recursions for orthogonal polynomials, and thus compute \(P_k(X)\) which is proportional to \(\sum_{i=0}^k \frac{1}{\alpha_i} Q_i(1) Q_i(X)\). This leads however to a somewhat complicated algorithm, and some additional polynomial magic can be invoked.</p>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out that kernel polynomials, of which \(P_k\) is a special case, are themselves proportional to orthogonal polynomials for the modified measure \((1-\lambda) d \sigma(\lambda)\) (see proof at the end of the post). This is useful to generate the optimal polynomial with a second-order recursion.</p>



<p class="justify-text">To summarize, if we know the spectral measure \(d\sigma\), then we can derive a sequence of polynomials \(P_k\) that leads to an optimal value for \(\displaystyle \int_{-1}^1 \!\! P_k(\lambda)^2 d \sigma(\lambda)\). However, knowing precisely the spectral density is typically as hard as finding the fixed point of the recursion.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Since convergence properties are dictated by the behavior of the spectral measure around \(-1\) and \(1\), i.e., by the number of eigenvalues around \(-1\) and \(1\), we can model the spectral measure by simple distributions with varied behavior at the two ends of the spectrum. A known family is the rescaled Beta distribution, with density proportional to \((1-x)^\alpha (1+x)^\beta\). This will lead to Jacobi polynomials and “simple” formulas below.</p>



<h2>Jacobi polynomials</h2>



<p class="justify-text">For \(\alpha, \beta &gt; -1\), the \(k\)-th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_polynomials">Jacobi polynomial</a> \(J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}\) is equal to $$J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x) = \frac{(-1)^k}{2^k k!} (1-x)^{-\alpha} (1+x)^{-\beta} \frac{d^k}{dx^k} \Big\{ (1-x)^{\alpha + k} (1+x)^{\beta + k} \Big\}.$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">Denoting \(\displaystyle d\sigma(x) =   \frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)} ( 1 -x )^\alpha (1+x)^\beta dx\) the rescaled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution">Beta distribution</a> (with \(\Gamma(\cdot)\) the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function">Gamma function</a>), the Jacobi polynomials are orthogonal for the probability measure \(d\sigma\). That is, $$ \int_{-1}^1  \! J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x) J_\ell^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x) d\sigma(x) = 0, $$ if \(k \neq \ell\), and equal to \(\displaystyle \alpha_k = \frac{1}{2k+\alpha + \beta + 1} \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2) \Gamma(k+\alpha+1) \Gamma(k+\beta+1)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)  \Gamma(k+1) \Gamma(k+\alpha+\beta+1)}\) if \(k=\ell\). We have the following equivalent \( \displaystyle \alpha_k \sim \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1) }\frac{1}{2k}\) when \(k\) tends to infinity. All the formulas in these sections can be obtained from standard references on orthogonal polynomials [2, 3] (with a summary on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_polynomials">Wikipedia</a>) and are presented without proofs.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The value at 1 is an important quantity for acceleration, and is equal to: $$ J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}(1) = {k+\alpha \choose k} = \frac{\Gamma(k+\alpha+1)}{\Gamma(k+1) \Gamma(\alpha+1)} \sim \frac{ (k/e)^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)},$$ while the value at -1 is equal to $$ J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}(-1) =(-1)^k {k+\beta \choose k} = \frac{\Gamma(k+\beta+1)}{\Gamma(k+1) \Gamma(\beta+1)} \sim \frac{ (k/e)^\beta}{\Gamma(\beta+1)}.$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to compute the polynomials, the following recursion is key: $$  J_{k+1}^{(\alpha,\beta)}(X) = (a_k^{(\alpha,\beta)} X + \tilde{b}_k^{(\alpha,\beta)})J_k^{(\alpha,\beta)} – c_k J_{k-1}^{(\alpha,\beta)}(X),$$ with coefficients with explicit (and slightly complicated) formulas (in the case you wonder why I use \(\tilde{b}\) instead of \(b\), this is to avoid overloading the notation with the iteration \(x_{k+1}= Ax_{k}-b\)): $$a_k^{(\alpha,\beta)} =   \frac{(2k+\alpha+\beta+1)  (2k+2+\alpha+\beta)  }{(2k+2)(k+1+\alpha+\beta)  },\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $$ $$ \tilde{b}_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}  =   \frac{(2k+\alpha+\beta+1) ( \alpha^2 – \beta^2 )}{(2k+2)(k+1+\alpha+\beta) (2k + \alpha+\beta )},$$ $$c_k^{(\alpha,\beta)}  =\frac{ 2 (k+\alpha)(k+\beta)(2k +2+\alpha+\beta) }{(2k+2)(k+1+\alpha+\beta) (2k + \alpha+\beta )}.  $$ It can be started with \(J_0^{(\alpha,\beta)}(X) = 1\) and \(J_1^{(\alpha,\beta)}(X) = \frac{\alpha – \beta}{2} +\frac{ \alpha + \beta +2}{2} X\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The class of Jacobi polynomials includes many of other important polynomials, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials">Chebyshev polynomials</a> (\(\alpha = \beta = -1/2\)), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials">Legendre polynomials</a> (\(\alpha = \beta = 0\)) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gegenbauer_polynomials">Gegenbauer polynomials </a>(\(\alpha = \beta = d-1/2\)). Here are plots below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="387" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jacobi-1.gif" class="wp-image-1604" height="202" />Jacobi polynomials, as used for the acceleration of gossip algorithms in one-dimension, with \((\alpha,\beta) = (1/2,-1/2)\).</figure></div>



<h2>Jacobi acceleration</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We can now apply the polynomial acceleration technique above to the Beta distribution, that is for \(\displaystyle d\sigma(x) =   \frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)} ( 1 -x )^\alpha (1+x)^\beta dx\), we have:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Regular recursion error</strong> (no acceleration):  the error \(e(X^k) = \displaystyle \int_{-1}^1 \lambda^{2k} d\sigma(\lambda)\) is asymptotically equivalent to \(\displaystyle \frac{C_{\alpha,\beta}}{k^{\alpha+1}}+\frac{C_{\beta,\alpha}}{k^{\beta+1}}\), for some constants \(C_{\alpha,\beta}\) (see details at the end of the post). Before acceleration, there is thus an equivalent impact of the spectrum around \(-1\) and \(1\).</li><li><strong>Jacobi acceleration error</strong>: as shown at the end of the post, the error \(e(P_k)\) is equivalent to \(\displaystyle  \frac{E_{\alpha,\beta}}{k^{2\alpha+2}} \) for some constant \(E_{\alpha,\beta}\). </li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">What’s happening around \(-1\) and \(1\) is important, and particular the behavior around 1, and we thus see that \(\beta\) is less important for the accelerated version (in fact, using \(\beta=0\) to construct the Jacobi polynomial, as done in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>], leads to a similar acceleration). In particular, when considering distributions where \(\beta = \alpha\), then we see that Jacobi acceleration transforms a rate proportional to \(1/k^{\alpha+1}\) to a rate proportional to \(1/k^{2\alpha+2}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The final recursion is then equal to (see detailed computations at the end of the post): $$ y_{k+1} =  \frac{(2k\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta\!+\!2)   }{2(k\!+\!2\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta)(k\!+\!\alpha\!+\!2)  }  \big[ (2k\!+\!3\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta) (Ay_k-b) +  \frac{ (\alpha\!+\!1)^2\! -\! \beta^2  }{  2k \!+\! 1\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta }    y_k    \Big] \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  $$ $$\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  –  \frac{    (k+\beta)(2k +3+\alpha+\beta) }{ (k+2+\alpha+\beta) (2k + 1+\alpha+\beta )} \frac{ k }{ k+\alpha+2} y_{k-1}, $$ with initialization \(y_0=x_0\) and \(y_1 = \frac{\alpha+\beta+3}{2\alpha+4}(Ax_0 – b) + \frac{\alpha+1-\beta}{2\alpha+4}x_0\). For \(\alpha = \frac{d}{2}-1\) and \(\beta =0\), this exactly recovers the recursion from [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>].</p>



<h2>Application to gossip</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Like in the previous post we consider the gossip problem. For large grid graphs, the gap is small, equivalent to \(\frac{1}{2d} \frac{1}{n^{2/d}}\) for the \(d\)-dimensional grid. The gap is tending to zero with \(n\), and using acceleration techniques for non-zero gaps, such as Chebyshev acceleration, is not efficient for the earlier iterations.</p>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out that for grid graphs, the spectral measure tends to a limit with behavior \((1-x^2)^{d/2-1}\) around \(-1\) and \(1\). This is formerly true for the grid graph, and the behavior around 1 (which is the one that matters for acceleration) is the same for a large class of graphs with an underlying geometric structure [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>]. This thus corresponds to the Beta distribution of parameters \(\alpha = \beta = \frac{d}{2}-1\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Below, I consider gossiping on a chain graph with \(n=200\) nodes, and compare regular gossip with Chebyshev acceleration and Jacobi acceleration. In early iterations, Jacobi acceleration is much better. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="673" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gossip_jacobi_1D.gif" class="wp-image-1714" height="204" />Gossiping a one-dimensional white noise signal of length \(n = 200\), converging to its mean, which is zero. (left) regular gossip, (center) Chebyshev acceleration, (right) Jacobi acceleration</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">When looking at the convergence rate (plot below), for late iterations, the linear convergence of Chebyshev acceleration does take over; for a method that achieves the best of both world (good in early and late iterations), see [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>, Section 7].</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="441" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/gossip_jacobi_1D_double-1024x457.png" class="wp-image-1808" height="196" />Squared gossiping errors (norm between the signal and its average) in natural (left) and logarithmic (right) scale. Chebyshev acceleration is slow at the beginning, and faster at the end (once the error is already quite small).</figure></div>



<p>Similar plots may be made in two dimensions, gossiping a white noise signal, where the stationary behavior is observed much sooner for Jacobi acceleration. Here, Chebyshev acceleration performs worse than the regular iteration because the eigengap is very small (equal to \(6 \times 10^{-4}\)).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img width="663" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/gossip_jacobi_2D-1.gif" class="wp-image-1859" height="180" />Gossiping a two-dimensional white noise signal of size \(n = 64 \times 64 = 4096\), converging to its mean, which is zero.

<p class="justify-text">When gossiping a Dirac signal, we can also observe the spreading of information from the original position of the Dirac to the rest of the grid.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img width="661" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/gossip_jacobi_2D_diracs-1.gif" class="wp-image-1858" height="179" />Gossiping a two-dimensional Dirac signal of size \(n = 64 \times 64 = 4096\), converging to its mean.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I tried to move from the worst-case analysis of spectral acceleration which typically focuses on largest and smallest eigenvalues of the involved contracting operators, closer to an average-case analysis that takes into account the whole spectrum. This led to acceleration by Jacobi polynomials rather than Chebyshev polynomials. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Beyond gossip.</strong> While I have focused primarily on applications to gossip where the spectral measure can be well approximated, this can be extended to other situations. For example, Fabian Pedregosa and Damien Scieur [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04756.pdf">5</a>] recently considered an application of polynomial acceleration to gradient descent for least-squares regression with independent covariates, where the spectral measure of the covariance matrix tends to the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marchenko%E2%80%93Pastur_distribution">Marchenko-Pastur</a> distribution (which is close to the rescaled Beta distributions above).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Jacobi polynomials beyond acceleration.</strong> In this post, I focused only on the acceleration properties of Jacobi polynomials. There are many more interesting applications of these polynomials in machine learning and associated fields. For example, their role in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics">spherical harmonics</a> to provide an orthonormal basis of the square-integrable functions on the unit sphere in any dimension, is quite useful for the theoretical study of neural networks (see, e.g., [<a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/14-546/14-546.pdf">6</a>] and references therein). I would typically say that this is a topic for another post, but this would be even more technical…</p>



<p class="justify-text">Next month, I will probably take a break in the polynomial magic series, and go back to less technical posts.</p>

<h2>Detailed computations</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Kernel polynomial as orthogonal polynomial</strong>. We consider a series \((R_k)\) of orthogonal polynomials for the measure \((1-\lambda) d\sigma(\lambda)\). Assuming that \(R_k \neq 0\) (see proof in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>, Appendix D]), then we show that the polynomial \(\frac{R_k(X)}{R_k(1)}\) is the optimal polynomial of degree \(k\) minimizing \(\int_{-1}^1 P^2(\lambda) d\sigma(\lambda)\) such that \(P(1)=1\). Indeed, taking any polynomial \(P\) of degree \(k\) and such that \(P(1)=1\), the polynomial \(P(X) \, – \frac{R_k(X)}{R_k(1)}\) vanishes at \(1\) and can thus be written as \(A(X)(X-1)\) with \(A(X)\) of degree equal or less than \(k-1\). Then we have: $$\! \int_{-1}^1 \! \! P(\lambda)^2 d\lambda = \! \int_{-1}^1\!\!   \frac{R_k(\lambda)^2}{R_k(1)^2}d\sigma(\lambda) + 2 \! \int_{-1}^1 \!\!  \frac{R_k(\lambda)}{R_k(1)} A(\lambda)(\lambda-1)d\sigma(\lambda)+ \! \int_{-1}^1  \!\! \! A(\lambda)^2(\lambda-1)^2 d\sigma(\lambda).$$ The second term in the right hand side is equal to zero by orthogonality of \((R_k)\), and the third term is non-negative. Therefore, we must have  \(\displaystyle \! \int_{-1}^1 \! \! P(\lambda)^2 d\lambda \geq  \! \int_{-1}^1\!\!   \frac{R_k(\lambda)^2}{R_k(1)^2}d\sigma(\lambda)\), which shows optimality.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Jacobi recursion</strong>. Given the original recursion \(x_{k+1} = A x_k – b\), we consider \(y_k = \frac{Q_k(A) ( x_0  – x_\ast)}{Q_k(1)} + x_\ast\), where \(Q_k = J_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)}\). We get: $$ y_{k+1} =  \frac{(a_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} A + b_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)})Q_{k}(A)( x_0  – x_\ast) – c_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} Q_{k-1}(A) ( x_0  – x_\ast)}{Q_{k+1}(1)} + x_\ast.$$ This leads to $$ y_{k+1} =  \frac{(a_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} A + b_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)})Q_{k}(1) (y_k – x_\ast) – c_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} Q_{k-1}(1) ( y_{k-1}  – x_\ast)}{Q_{k+1}(1)} + x_\ast.$$ Removing all terms in \(x_\ast\) (which have to cancel), we get: $$ y_{k+1} =  a_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} \frac{Q_{k}(1)}{Q_{k+1}(1)}(Ay_k-b) + \tilde{b}_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} \frac{Q_{k}(1)}{Q_{k+1}(1)}y_k –  c_k^{(\alpha+1,\beta)} \frac{Q_{k-1}(1)}{Q_{k+1}(1)}y_{k-1}. $$ Using the explicit formula for \(Q_{k}(1)\), we get after some calculations: $$ y_{k+1} =  \frac{(2k\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta\!+\!2)   }{2(k\!+\!2\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta)(k\!+\!\alpha\!+\!2)  }  \big[ (2k\!+\!3\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta) (Ay_k-b) +  \frac{ (\alpha\!+\!1)^2\! -\! \beta^2  }{  2k \!+\! 1\!+\!\alpha\!+\!\beta }    y_k    \Big] \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  $$ $$\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  –  \frac{    (k+\beta)(2k +3+\alpha+\beta) }{ (k+2+\alpha+\beta) (2k + 1+\alpha+\beta )} \frac{ k }{ k+\alpha+2} y_{k-1}, $$ with initialization \(y_0 = x_0\) and \(y_1 = \frac{\alpha+\beta+3}{2\alpha+4}(Ax_0 – b) + \frac{\alpha+1-\beta}{2\alpha+4}x_0\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Equivalents of performance</strong>. We first provide an equivalent of $$ \int_{-1}^1 \lambda^{2k} d\sigma(\lambda) = \frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)}\int_{-1}^1 \! x^{2k} (1-x)^\alpha(1+x)^\beta dx.$$ By splitting the sum in two, this is equivalent to $$ \frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)}\Big\{ 2^\beta\!\! \int_{0}^1 \! x^{2k} (1-x)^\alpha dx  + 2^\alpha \!\! \int_{0}^1 \! x^{2k}(1-x)^\beta dx \Big\},$$ leading to, using the normalizing factor of the Beta distribution, $$\frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)} \Big\{ 2^\beta\frac{\Gamma(\alpha+1)\Gamma(2k+1)}{\Gamma(\alpha+2k+2)} +2^\alpha\frac{\Gamma(\beta+1)\Gamma(2k+1)}{\Gamma(\beta+2k+2)}   \Big\}, $$ and finally to  $$ \displaystyle \frac{1}{2^{\alpha+\beta+1} } \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1)} \Big\{ 2^\beta\frac{\Gamma(\alpha+1) }{ (2k/e)^{\alpha+1} }  +2^\alpha\frac{\Gamma(\beta+1) }{ (2k/e)^{\beta+1} }    \Big\} ,$$ which is indeed of the form \(\displaystyle \frac{C_{\alpha,\beta}}{k^{\alpha+1}}+\frac{C_{\beta,\alpha}}{k^{\beta+1}}\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to estimate \(e(P_k)\), since \(P_k(X) = \sum_{i=0}^k \frac{1}{\alpha_i} Q_i(1) Q_i(X)\), we first need an equivalent of the term \(\displaystyle \frac{Q_i(1)^2}{\alpha_i^2} \sim \frac{(i/e)^{2\alpha}}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)^2} \Big( \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta +2)}{\Gamma(\alpha+1) \Gamma(\beta +1) }\frac{1}{2i}\Big)^{-1} \sim E_{\alpha,\beta}’ i^{2\alpha+1}\), for some \(E_{\alpha,\beta}’\), leading to an error of the form \(e(P_k) \displaystyle \sim \frac{1}{ E_{\alpha,\beta}’  \sum_{i=0}^k i^{2\alpha+1}} \sim\frac{2\alpha+2}{ E_{\alpha,\beta}’} \frac{1}{k^{2\alpha+2}} \), which is of the desired form.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Spectral density of a grid</strong>. As seen at the far end of the <a href="https://francisbach.com/chebyshev-polynomials/">previous blog post</a>, the eigenvalues of \(A\) for the grid in one-dimension, with \(m=n\), is (up to negligible corrections) \(–  \cos \frac{k\pi}{m}\) for \(k =1,\dots,m\). This leads to a limiting spectral measure as \(– \cos \theta\) for \(\theta\) uniformly distributed on \([0,\pi]\). This leads to a spectral density \(\frac{1}{\pi}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\lambda^2}}\) supported on \([-1,1]\). In the plot below, we see that the histogram of eigenvalues for a finite \(m\) matches empirically this density.</p>

<p class="justify-text">For a \(d\)-dimensional grid, with \(n = m^d\), the spectral density is the one of \(\frac{1}{d} (X_1+\cdots X_d)\) for \(X_i\) independent and distributed as \(\frac{1}{\pi}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\lambda^2}} d\lambda\) on \([-1,1]\), for each \(i=1,\dots,d\). This leads to a convolution power of the density above, rescaled to have support in \([-1,1]\). This can be shown to lead to behavior as \((1-\lambda^2)^{d/2-1}\) around \(1\) and \(-1\) (see [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797016v2/document">4</a>, Prop. 5.2]).</p></div>

<p class="justify-text">Orthogonal polynomials pop up everywhere in applied mathematics and in particular in numerical analysis. Within machine learning and optimization, typically (a) they provide natural basis functions which are easy to manipulate, or (b) they can be used to model various acceleration mechanisms.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I will describe one class of such polynomials, the Chebyshev polynomials (Tchebychev in French, Чебышёв in Russian), whose extremal properties (beyond being orthogonal) are useful in the analysis of accelerated algorithms. </p>



<h2>Definition and first properties</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The \(k\)-th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials">Chebyshev polynomial</a> \(T_k\) is classically defined as the unique polynomial such that $$\forall  \theta \in [0,2\pi], \  \cos (k\theta) = T_k(\cos \theta).$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Recurrence</strong>. Summing the two equations \(\cos [(k\pm 1)\theta] = \cos (k\theta) \cos \theta \mp \sin (k\theta) \sin \theta\), the following recurrence relationship can be deduced: $$\forall k &gt;0, \ T_{k+1}(X) = 2X T_k(X) \, – T_{k-1}(X).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">Together with the first two polynomials \(T_0 (X) = 1\) and \(T_1(X) = X\), this leads to \(T_2(X) = 2X^2 – 1\), \(T_3(X) = 4X^3 – 3X\), and so on.</p>



<p class="justify-text">From the recurrence relationships, one can easily deduce that \(T_k\) has the parity of \(k\) and that \(T_k\) has degree \(k\), with leading coefficient \(2^{k-1}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Oscillatory behavior</strong>. For \(k\theta = j \pi\), for \(j\) integer, we have \(\cos (k \theta)=(-1)^j\), while when \(j\) goes from \(k\) to \(0\), \(\cos \theta = \cos\! \big( \frac{ j \pi}{k}\big)\) goes from -1 to 1. Thus, on \([-1,1]\), \(T_k(x)\) oscillates between \(-1\) and \(1\), with equality for \(\cos\! \big(  \frac{j \pi}{k} \big)\) for \(j = 0,\dots,k\). This oscillatory behavior is illustrated below and crucial for the extremal properties below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="306" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/chebyshev-3.gif" class="wp-image-1592" height="223" />First 33 Chebyshev polynomials, plotted between -1 and 1. Note the stronger oscillatory behavior between -1 and 1 as \(k\) grows.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Orthogonality</strong>. Using the orthogonality of the Fourier basis on \([0,2\pi]\), we have for \(k \neq \ell\),  \(\int_0^{\pi} \cos (k\theta) \cos (\ell\theta) d\theta=0\), and with the change of variable \(x = \cos \theta\), we obtain $$\int_{-1}^1 \frac{T_k(x) T_\ell(x)}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} dx = 0.$$ Thus the Chebyshev polynomials inherit from many properties from such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_polynomials">orthogonal polynomials</a> (such as the two-term recursion above, but for the Chebyshev polynomials, these can obtained more directly). For further properties, see [1].</p>



<h2>Extremal properties</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Chebyshev polynomials exhibit many “extremal properties”, of the form: among all polynomials of degree \(k\) with some form of normalization (e.g., fixed \(k\)-th order coefficient or value at given point), the one with smallest specific norm is proportional to \(T_k\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The most classical one is as follows: the polynomial \(P\) of degree \(k\) with \(k\)-th order coefficient equal to one, and with minimum \(\ell_\infty\)-norm \(\max_{ x \in [-1,1]} \! | P(x)|\) on \([-1,1]\), is \(P = \frac{1}{2^{k-1}}T_k\). The proof is particularly elegant and simple (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials">here</a>). Since this is not the property that we need for optimization, we will consider another one.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Proposition</strong> (<em>largest value outside of \([-1,1]\)</em>). For any polynomial \(P\) of degree \(k\) such that \(|P(x)| \leq 1\) for \(x \in [-1,1]\), and any \(z &gt; 1\), \(|P(z)| \leq T_k(z)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><em>Proof</em>. By contradiction, we assume that there exists \(z &gt; 1\) such that \(P(z)&gt;T_k(z)\) (the other possibility \(P(z) &lt; -T_k(z)\) is done by replacing \(P\) by \(-P\)). Without loss of generality, we can assume that \(\max_{x \in [-1,1]} |P(x) | &lt; 1\) (by potentially rescaling \(P\)). Then, the polynomial \(Q = P – T_k\) of degree \(k\) has alternatively strictly positive and negative values between \(-1\) and \(z&gt;1\). Indeed, \(Q(z) &gt; 0\), and \((-1)^j Q\big(\cos\! \big(\frac{j \pi}{k}\big)\big) &lt; 0 \) for all \(j = 0,\dots,k\). Therefore there are \(k+2\) alternating signs, and thus \(k+1\) zeros, which implies that \(Q=0\) since \(Q\) has degree \(k\). This is a contradiction with the existence of \(z\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that for any \(\theta\), \(T_k( \cosh \theta) = \cosh (k\theta)\) (which can be shown by induction), and \(T_k\) is thus increasing on \([1,+\infty)\) with values quickly increasing as \(k\) grows. See an illustration below.</p>

Note the exploding behavior as \(k\) grows.</figure></div>



<h2>Chebyshev acceleration</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider a recursion in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) of the form \(x_k = A x_{k-1} – b\), with \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) a symmetric matrix and eigenvalues in \([-\rho,\rho]\) with \(\rho \in [0,1)\). Such recursions are ubiquitous in data science, as (1) gradient descent on a strongly-convex quadratic function, or (b) gossip for distributed averaging [<a href="http://www.web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/gossip.pdf">2</a>] (see an example in a section below).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The recursion converges to the unique (because \(\rho \in [0,1)\)) fixed point \(x_\ast \in \mathbb{R}^n\) such that \(x_\ast =  A x_\ast – b\). We have, by unrolling the recursion: $$ x_k – x_\ast = A ( x_{k-1} – x_\ast) = A^k (x_0 – x_\ast).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">This leads to the usual exponential convergence rate \(\| x_k – x_\ast\|_2 \leq \rho^k \| x_0 – x_\ast\|_2\). In the following, writing \(\rho = 1 – ( 1-\rho)\) makes explicit the importance of \(1-\rho\), which is the gap between \(1\) and the largest eigenvalue of \(A\). Increasing this gap is equivalent to accelerating the convergence rate.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to speed-up convergence, a classical idea is to take linear combinations of all past iterates. That is, we consider \(y_k = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k x_i\) for some weights \(\nu_i^k\) such that \(\sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k=1\) (so that if all iterates are already at \(x_\ast\), then the weighted average stays there). We have $$ y_k – x_\ast =  \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k ( x_i – x_\ast) = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k A^i (x_0-x_\ast) = P_k(A) (x_0-x_\ast),$$ where \(P_k(X) = \sum_{i=0}^k \nu_i^k X^i\) is a polynomial such that \(P_k(1)=1\).  Therefore, we have: $$  \| y_k – x_\ast\|_2 \leq \max_{\lambda \in [-\rho, \rho]} |P_k(\lambda)| \cdot \|x_0 – x_\ast\|_2.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to select the best polynomial, we are looking for \(P_k\) such that \(P_k(1)=1\) and \(\max_{\lambda \in [-\rho,\rho]}\! |P_k(\lambda)|\) is as small as possible. Up to mapping \([-\rho,\rho]\) to \([-1,1]\), we know from the extremal property above that the optimal polynomial is exactly a rescaled Chebyshev polynomial, that is, $$P_k(X) = \frac{T_k(X/\rho)}{T_k(1/\rho)}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The maximal value on \([-\rho,\rho]\) is then \((T_k(1/\rho))^{-1}\). In order to compare to \(\rho^k\) (no acceleration), we can provide an equivalent of \([T_k(1/\rho)]^{-1/k}\) as \(\frac{\rho}{ 1+ \sqrt{1-\rho^2}}\) (see end of the post). There is no real acceleration when \(\rho\) is bounded away from 1, but as \(\rho\) tends to \(1\), this can be shown (see also the end of the post) to be equivalent to \(1 – \sqrt{2(1\!-\!\rho)}\), with the usual “square root” acceleration: \(1\!-\!\rho\) is essentially replaced by \(\sqrt{1\!-\!\rho}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We thus get an acceleration, but as is, computing \(y_k\) seems to require to store all values of \(x_1,\dots,x_k\), which is not practical. Since there is a second-order recursion for Chebyshev polynomials, one can derive one as well, directly for the sequence \((y_k)\).  A somewhat lengthy calculation (see end of the post) leads to the recursion $$ y_{k+1} = \omega_{k+1} ( Ay_{k} – b) + (1-\omega_{k+1}) y_{k-1}, $$<br />with a sequence \(\omega_{k+1}\) also defined by recursion as \(\omega_{k+1} = ( 1 – \frac{\rho^2}{4} \omega_k)^{-1}\), initialized with \(\omega_1 = 2\), \(y_0 = x_0\), \(y_1 = Ax_0 – b\). Therefore, on top of the usual computation of \(A y_k -b\), Chebyshev acceleration comes at no extra computational cost.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Simpler stationary recursion</strong>. In the recursion above, the parameter \(\omega_k\) varies with \(k\). A similar (then non totally optimal) acceleration can be obtained by replacing all \(\omega_k\)’s by their limit \(\omega\) when \(k\) tends to infinity, which is characterized by the equation \(\omega = ( 1-\frac{\rho^2}{4} \omega)^{-1}\) with smallest solutions \(\frac{ 1/\rho    – \sqrt{1/\rho^2 -1}}{\rho/2}\)  (see end of the post for detailed computations). The now stationary recursion then becomes $$ y_{k+1} = \omega ( Ay_{k} – b) + (1-\omega) y_{k-1}, $$ and is exponentially convergent with rate proportional to \(\rho \omega/2 =  \frac{1}{1/\rho + \sqrt{ 1/\rho^2 – 1}} = \frac{\rho}{1+ \sqrt{ 1 – \rho^2}}\). Thus, the recursion is simpler and the final speed asymptotically the same as full Chebyshev acceleration.</p>



<h2>Relationship with other acceleration mechanisms</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Non-adaptive schemes</strong>. As seen above for an affine operator \(F:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n\) (i.e., \(F(x) = Ax-b\)), Chebyshev acceleration takes a recursion of the form $$x_{k+1} = F(x_{k}),$$ and linearly combines iterates; it ends up creating second-order recursions of the form $$ y_{k+1} = \omega_{k+1} F(y_k) + (1-\omega_{k+1}) y_{k-1}, $$ with the same fixed points. Other formats (with fixed point preservation) can be considered such as $$ y_{k+1} = F(y_k) + \delta_{k+1}(y_k –  y_{k-1}),$$ or $$ y_{k+1} = F(y_k) + \delta_{k+1}(F(y_k) –  F(y_{k-1})), $$ for some constants \(\delta_{k+1}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">When \(F\) is affine, the format does not matter much (and all end up being essentially equivalent), but for gradient descent algorithms where \(F(x) = x – \gamma f'(x)\) for some non-quadratic function \(f\) and \(\gamma\) a step-size, there is a difference, the last one corresponding to Nesterov acceleration (see a nice post on it <a href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2014/03/06/nesterovs-accelerated-gradient-descent-for-smooth-and-strongly-convex-optimization/">here</a>), and the one before to classical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">momentum</a>, also known as the heavy-ball method (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.7457">3</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Adaptive schemes</strong>. The methods above need to know the bound on the spectrum \(\rho\). They have to commit to such a value (which is typically only known through upper bounds) and cannot “get lucky”, that is, even if the best value \(\rho\) is known, they cannot benefit from additional better properties of the spectrum of \(A\) (e.g., clustered eigenvalues). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method">conjugate gradient</a> method, which accesses the matrix \(A\) with the slightly stronger oracle of computing \(Ax\) any \(x\) (and not only \(Ax – b\)), or Anderson acceleration (which does not need a stronger oracle), are adaptive for similar problems [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/10078356X">4</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04133">5</a>]. Again, Chebyshev polynomials are present; probably more on this in future posts!</p>



<h2>Application to accelerated gossip</h2>



<p class="justify-text">A interesting linear recursion pops out in distributed optimization, where we assume that computers or processors are placed in \(n\) nodes in a network, and the goal is to minimize an average of function \(f_1,\dots,f_n\), each of them only accessible by the corresponding node. The nodes are allowed to communicate messages along each edge of a network. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="255" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2dgrid.png" class="wp-image-1367" height="221" />Two-dimensional grid with \(d = 8 \times 8 = 64\) nodes.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">The simplest of such problem is the network averaging problem where \(f_i(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} (\theta – \xi_i)^2\), for a uni-dimensional parameter \(\theta\) and \(\xi \in \mathbb{R}^n\). The solution of this consensus is \(\theta_\ast = \frac{1}{n} \! \sum_{i=1}^n \! \xi_i\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The gossip algorithm [<a href="http://www.web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/gossip.pdf">2</a>] consists in iteratively replacing the value \(\theta_i\) at a given node by a weighted average \(\sum_{j \sim i} W_{ij} \theta_j\) of the values at neighboring nodes (and node \(i\)). If all \(n\) nodes communicate simultaneously, then the vector \(\theta \) is replaced by \(W \theta\), hence a linear recursion $$ \theta_{k+1} = W \theta_{k},$$ initialized at \(\theta_0 = \xi\). Assuming that \(W\) is symmetric, with non-negative off-diagonal elements, and such that \(W 1_n = 1_n\) (where \(1_n \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is the vector of all ones), then all eigenvalues of \(W\) except the largest one are included in the interval \([-\rho, \rho]\), with \(\rho \in (0,1)\) for a connected graph. A simple such matrix \(W\) can be obtained from the adjacency matrix \(A\) of the graph, such that \(A_{ij} = 1\) if nodes \(i\) and \(j\) are connected, and zero otherwise, as \(W = I – \alpha L \), with \(L = {\rm Diag}(A 1_n) – A\) the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_matrix">Laplacian matrix</a> and \(\alpha\) selected so that the eigenvalues are all between \(-\rho\) and \(\rho\), except one, which is equal to 1 (see values of \(\rho\) and \(\alpha\) at the end of the post). We will see below that this extra eigenvalue which is equal to one is in fact not a problem for analyzing the convergence of this network averaging procedure.</p>



<p class="justify-text">When applying the gossip matrix \(W\) iteratively to \(\theta_0 = \xi\), the projection on the eigensubspace corresponding to the unit eigenvalue is not changed, while all other projections on the other eigensubspaces converge to zero at rate at most \(\rho^k\). Thus \(\theta_k\) converges to the constant vector \(\frac{1}{n} 1_n 1_n^\top \xi\) at rate \(\rho^k\), and thus to a constant vector, with the average \(\frac{1}{n} \! \sum_{i=1}^n \! \xi_i\) in all components.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Given that we have a linear recursion, we can use Chebyshev acceleration defined above and obtain substantial improvements, as illustrated below. For the use of this acceleration within distributed optimization algorithms, see [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01478317/document">6</a>] and references therein.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img width="696" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gossip_threeplots-3.gif" class="wp-image-1636" height="193" />Comparison of gossip algorithms on a two-dimensional grid (each cell correspond to a value \(\xi_i \in [-1,1]\) to average): (left) regular gossip, (center) accelerated second-order recursion with constant coefficients, (right) Chebyshev acceleration. Convergence is much faster with acceleration, (only) slightly better for Chebyshev acceleration, which is the optimal polynomial acceleration.</figure>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Among classical classes of orthogonal polynomials, Chebyshev polynomials are special, because beyond being orthogonal, they satisfy extremal properties that are particularly useful in numerical analysis.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In future posts, I plan to go over Jacobi polynomials (which include Legendre, Gegenbauer and Chebyshev polynomials), Hermite polynomials, and finally Bernoulli polynomials (which are not orthogonal but still very special). For all of these, there are natural applications in machine learning.</p>

<h2>Detailed Computations</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Limit of </strong>\([T_k(1/\rho)]^{-1/k}\). For \(z \geq 1\), then a well-known property of Chebyshev polynomials is that \(T_k(z) = \cosh [ k \, {\rm acosh} (z)]\) (which can be shown by induction using basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_function">hyperbolic trigonometry</a> identities). Moreover, we have \({\rm acosh} (z) = \log( z + \sqrt{z^2-1} )\) and thus $$T_k(z) = \frac{1}{2} \big[ \big( z + \sqrt{z^2-1} \big)^k + \big(z – \sqrt{z^2-1}\big)^k  \big].$$ For \(z = 1/\rho\), and taking limits, we get that \([T_k(z)]^{1/k}\) tends to \( z + \sqrt{z^2-1}\), which leads to the limit \(\frac{\rho}{ 1+ \sqrt{1-\rho^2}}\) for \([T_k(z)]^{-1/k}\). Then a classical Taylor expansion in \(1-\rho\) leads to \(1 – \sqrt{2(1-\rho)}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Recurrence for Chebyshev acceleration</strong>. We have, using the recursion for Chebyshev polynomials $$y_{k+1} – x_\ast = \frac{ 2 }{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)} (A/\rho) T_k(A/\rho) ( x_0 – x_\ast) \ – \frac{ 1  }{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)} T_{k-1}(A/\rho) ( x_0 – x_\ast).$$ Using the equality \(x_\ast = A x_\ast -b\), the terms in \(x_\ast\) cancel (they have to anyway, because \(P_k(1)=1\)). We then get $$y_{k+1}  = \frac{  (2/\rho) T_{k}(1/\rho)}{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)}  ( A y_k – b) \, – \frac{ T_{k-1}(1/\rho)  }{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)} y_{k-1}.$$</p>



<p>Using \(T_{k-1}(1/\rho) = (2/\rho) T_{k}(1/\rho) – T_{k+1}(1/\rho)\), and denoting \(\omega_{k+1} =  \frac{  (2/\rho) T_{k}(1/\rho)}{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)}\), we get $$y_{k+1} = \omega_{k+1} ( A y_{k} – b) + ( 1- \omega_{k+1}) y_{k-1}.$$ Reusing one last time the Chebyshev recursion, we get $$\omega_{k+1}^{-1} = \frac{T_{k+1}(1/\rho)}{  (2/\rho) T_{k}(1/\rho)}= 1 – \frac{T_{k-1}(1/\rho)}{  (2/\rho) T_{k}(1/\rho)} =1  – \frac{\rho^2}{4} \omega_{k},$$ which is the desired recursion.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Convergence of stationary recursion</strong>. The roots of \(\omega = ( 1-\frac{\rho^2}{4} \omega)^{-1}\) are the ones of \(\frac{\rho^2}{4} \omega^2 – \omega + 1 = 0\), with smallest solutions \(\omega = \frac{ 1/\rho   – \sqrt{1/\rho^2 -1}}{\rho/2}\). In order to study the second-order recursion $$ y_{k+1} = \omega ( Ay_{k} – b) + (1-\omega) y_{k-1}, $$ with constant coefficient, we need to compute the roots of \(r^2 = \omega \lambda r + (1-\omega)\), for \(|\lambda| \leq \rho\). The discriminant of this equation is \(\lambda^2 \omega^2 + 4 (1-\omega) \leq \rho^2 \omega^2 + 4(1-\omega) = 0\), and thus the roots are complex conjugate with squared modulus \((\omega\ – 1) = \frac{1}{4} \rho^2 \omega^2\) independent of \(\lambda\). Thus, as \(k\) tends to infinity, \(\| y_k  – x_\ast\|_2^{1/k}\) tends to \(\frac{1}{2} \rho \omega =   ( 1/\rho – \sqrt{ 1/\rho^2 – 1} ) = \frac{1}{1/\rho + \sqrt{ 1/\rho^2 – 1}}\), which is exactly the rate for Chebyshev acceleration.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of a square grid</strong>. Given a chain of length \(m\) such as depicted below, the \(m \times m\) Laplacian matrix can be shown (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05210">7</a>]) to have eigenvalues \(2 + 2 \cos \frac{k\pi}{m}\) for \(k =1,\dots,m\).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img width="350" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1dgrid.png" class="wp-image-1562" height="24" />One-dimensional grid with \(m = 8\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">For a two-dimensional grid of size \(m \times m\), then the \(m^2 \times m^2\) Laplacian matrix can be shown (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05210">7</a>]) to have eigenvalues \(4 + 2\cos \frac{k_1\pi}{m} + 2\cos \frac{k_2\pi}{m}\) for \(k_1,k_2 =1,\dots,m\). Therefore, the second smallest eigenvalue is \(\lambda_\min = 2 – 2 \cos \frac{\pi}{m}\) and the largest eigenvalue is \(\lambda_\max = 4 + 4  \cos \frac{\pi}{m}\). We then select \(\alpha\) such that \(1-\alpha \lambda_\min = \rho\) and \(1-\alpha \lambda_\max = -\rho\), leading to \(\alpha = \frac{2}{\lambda_\min + \lambda_\max} = \frac{2}{6 + 2 \cos \frac{\pi}{m}}\) and finally \(\rho = \frac{\lambda_\max – \lambda_\min}{\lambda_\max + \lambda_\min} = \frac{2 +6  \cos \frac{\pi}{m} }{6 + 2 \cos \frac{\pi}{m}}\sim \frac{8 – 3 \frac{\pi^2}{m^2}}{8 –  \frac{\pi^2}{m^2}}\sim 1 – \frac{\pi^2}{4 m^2}\). Thus, as a function of \(n = m^2\), the eigengap is proportional to \(1/n\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">More generally, for the grid of size \(m\) in dimension \(d\), then we get \(\lambda_\min = 2 – 2 \cos \frac{\pi}{m}\) and \(\lambda_\max = 2d + 2d  \cos \frac{\pi}{m}\), and \(\rho = \frac{\lambda_\max – \lambda_\min}{\lambda_\max + \lambda_\min} = \frac{2d-2 +(2d+2)  \cos \frac{\pi}{m} }{2d+2 + (2d-2) \cos \frac{\pi}{m}}\sim \frac{4d – (d+1) \frac{\pi^2}{m^2}}{4d –  (d-1)\frac{\pi^2}{m^2}}\sim 1 – \frac{\pi^2}{2d m^2}.\) Thus, as a function of \(n = m^d\), the eigengap is proportional to \(1/n^{2/d}\). Moreover, when \(m\) is large, the normalizing factor \(\alpha\) tends to \(1/(2d)\).</p></div>
