Blasiok (SODA'18) recently introduced the notion of a subgaussian sampler, defined as an averaging sampler for approximating the mean of functions $f:\{0,1\}^m \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(U_m)$ has subgaussian tails, and asked for explicit constructions. In this work, we give the first explicit constructions of subgaussian samplers (and in fact averaging samplers for the broader class of subexponential functions) that match the best-known constructions of averaging samplers for $[0,1]$-bounded functions in the regime of parameters where the approximation error $\varepsilon$ and failure probability $\delta$ are subconstant. Our constructions are established via an extension of the standard notion of randomness extractor (Nisan and Zuckerman, JCSS'96) where the error is measured by an arbitrary divergence rather than total variation distance, and a generalization of Zuckerman's equivalence (Random Struct. Alg.'97) between extractors and samplers. We believe that the framework we develop, and specifically the notion of an extractor for the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, are of independent interest. In particular, KL-extractors are stronger than both standard extractors and subgaussian samplers, but we show that they exist with essentially the same parameters (constructively and non-constructively) as standard extractors.</div>

In particular
Hilbert curves and their generalisations to higher dimension are used as an
indexing method because of their nice locality properties. This article
generalises this concept to the systematic construction of p-adic versions of
Hilbert curves based on affine transformations of the p-adic Gray code, and
develops an efficient scaled indexing method for data taken from
high-dimensional spaces based on these new curves, which with increasing
dimension is shown to be less space consuming than the optimal standard static
Hilbert curve index. A measure is derived which allows to assess the local
sparsity of a data set, and is tested on some data.

<p><b>Authors: </b>Andreas Rosowski <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07683">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>We show that the product of an nx3 matrix and a 3x3 matrix over a commutative
ring can be computed using 6n+3 multiplications. For two 3x3 matrices this
gives us an algorithm using 21 multiplications. This is an improvement with
respect to Makarov algorithm using 22 multiplications[10]. We generalize our
result for nx3 and 3x3 matrices and present an algorithm for computing the
product of an lxn matrix and an nxm matrix over a commutative ring for odd n
using n(lm+l+m-1)/2 multiplications if m is odd and using (n(lm+l+m-1)+l-1)/2
multiplications if m is even. Waksman algorithm for odd n needs
(n-1)(lm+l+m-1)/2+lm multiplications[16], thus in both cases less
multiplications are required by our algorithm.

<p><b>Authors: </b>Andre Linhares, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Swamy:Chaitanya.html">Chaitanya Swamy</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07381">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>Two-stage stochastic optimization is a framework for modeling uncertainty,
where we have a probability distribution over possible realizations of the
data, called scenarios, and decisions are taken in two stages: we make
first-stage decisions knowing only the underlying distribution and before a
scenario is realized, and may take additional second-stage recourse actions
after a scenario is realized. The goal is typically to minimize the total
expected cost. A criticism of this model is that the underlying probability
distribution is itself often imprecise! To address this, a versatile approach
that has been proposed is the {\em distributionally robust 2-stage model}:
given a collection of probability distributions, our goal now is to minimize
the maximum expected total cost with respect to a distribution in this
collection.
</p>
<p>We provide a framework for designing approximation algorithms in such
settings when the collection is a ball around a central distribution and the
central distribution is accessed {\em only via a sampling black box}.
</p>
<p>We first show that one can utilize the {\em sample average approximation}
(SAA) method to reduce the problem to the case where the central distribution
has {\em polynomial-size} support. We then show how to approximately solve a
fractional relaxation of the SAA (i.e., polynomial-scenario
central-distribution) problem. By complementing this via LP-rounding algorithms
that provide {\em local} (i.e., per-scenario) approximation guarantees, we
obtain the {\em first} approximation algorithms for the distributionally robust
versions of a variety of discrete-optimization problems including set cover,
vertex cover, edge cover, facility location, and Steiner tree, with guarantees
that are, except for set cover, within $O(1)$-factors of the guarantees known
for the deterministic version of the problem.

job sizes are stochastic. The goal is to find a fixed assignment of jobs to
machines, to minimize the expected value of the maximum load over all the
machines. For the identical machines special case when the size of a job is the
same across all machines, a constant-factor approximation algorithm has long
been known. Our main result is the first constant-factor approximation
algorithm for the general case of unrelated machines. This is achieved by (i)
formulating a lower bound using an exponential-size linear program that is
efficiently computable, and (ii) rounding this linear program while satisfying
only a specific subset of the constraints that still suffice to bound the
expected makespan. We also consider two generalizations. The first is the
budgeted makespan minimization problem, where the goal is to minimize the
expected makespan subject to scheduling a target number (or reward) of jobs. We
extend our main result to obtain a constant-factor approximation algorithm for
this problem. The second problem involves $q$-norm objectives, where we want to
minimize the expected q-norm of the machine loads. Here we give an $O(q/\log
q)$-approximation algorithm, which is a constant-factor approximation for any
fixed $q$.

vertex is connected to at least $k$ other vertices within that subgraph. In
this work we introduce a distance-based generalization of the notion of
$k$-core, which we refer to as the $(k,h)$-core, i.e., the maximal subgraph in
which every vertex has at least $k$ other vertices at distance $\leq h$ within
that subgraph. We study the properties of the $(k,h)$-core showing that it
preserves many of the nice features of the classic core decomposition (e.g.,
its connection with the notion of distance-generalized chromatic number) and it
preserves its usefulness to speed-up or approximate distance-generalized
notions of dense structures, such as $h$-club.
</p>
<p>Computing the distance-generalized core decomposition over large networks is
intrinsically complex. However, by exploiting clever upper and lower bounds we
can partition the computation in a set of totally independent subcomputations,
opening the door to top-down exploration and to multithreading, and thus
achieving an efficient algorithm.

problem of workflow satisfiability, which asks whether the existence of
constraints in a workflow specification makes it impossible to allocate
authorized users to each step in the workflow. Recent developments have seen
the workflow satisfiability problem (WSP) studied in the context of workflow
specifications in which the set of steps may vary from one instance of the
workflow to another. This, in turn, means that some constraints may only apply
to certain workflow instances. Inevitably, WSP becomes more complex for such
workflow specifications. Other approaches have considered the possibility of
associating costs with the violation of `soft' constraints and authorizations.
Workflow satisfiability in this context becomes a question of minimizing the
cost of allocating users to steps in the workflow. In this paper, we introduce
new problems, which we believe to be of practical relevance, that combine these
approaches. In particular, we consider the question of whether, given a
workflow specification with costs and a `budget', all possible workflow
instances have an allocation of users to steps that does not exceed the budget.
We design a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm to solve this problem
parameterized by the total number of steps, release points and xor branchings.

<p>Recently a Twitter account started called <a href="https://twitter.com/justsaysinmice">justsaysinmice</a>.  The only thing this account does, is to repost breathless news articles about medical research breakthroughs that fail to mention that the effect in question was only observed in mice, and then add the words “IN MICE” to them.  Simple concept, but it already seems to be changing the conversation about science reporting.</p>



<p>It occurred to me that we could do something analogous for quantum computing.  While my own deep-seated aversion to Twitter prevents me from doing it myself, which of my readers is up for starting an account that just reposts one overhyped QC article after another, while appending the words “A CLASSICAL COMPUTER COULD ALSO DO THIS” to each one?</p></div>

<h3>Sweden</h3>
<p>I just came back from a trip to Sweden and the U.K. I was invited to Gothenburg to be the opponent for a Ph. D. Candidate  Malin Palö Forsström (by now Dr. Malin Palö Forsström),  who wrote her excellent Ph. D. thesis under the supervision of Jeff Steif in Chalmers University. We also used the opportunity for a lovely mini-mini-workshop</p>
<p>From Gothenburg I took the train to Stockholm to spend the weekend with Anders Björner and we talked about some old projects regarding algebraic shifting.  We had dinner with several colleagues including Svante Linusson who is a candidate for the European parliament!</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/acg80s.jpeg"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/acg80s.jpeg?w=640" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17296" /></a> <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/20190407_194045.jpg"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/20190407_194045.jpg?w=300&amp;h=168" alt="" width="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-17297" height="168" /></a></p>

<h3>The United Kingdom</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/bmc2019/">British Mathematical Colloquium at Lancaster</a> was a lovely 4-day general meeting, an opportunity to meet some old and new friends (and Internet MO friend <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/users/763/yemon-choi">Yemon Choi</a> in real life), and to learn about various new developments. I am aware of the fact that my list of unfulfilled promises is longer than those of most politicians, but I do hope to come back to some mathematics from this trip to Sweden and to Lancaster.</p>
<h3>Election Day</h3>
<p>Last week’s Tuesday was election day in Israel,  and as much as I like to participate (and to devote a post to election day here on the blog – in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/majority-rules-the-story-of-achnais-oven/">2009</a>, <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2013/01/22/election-day/">2012</a>, and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/03/17/election-day-2/">2015</a>) I had to miss the election, for the first time since 1985. (I still tried to follow the outcomes in real time.)</p>
<h3>The Negev, Israel</h3>
<p>And we are now spending a three-day vacation and doing some mild hiking in Mitzpe Ramon, in the Negev, the Israeli desert.  The view around here is spectacular. I first fell in love with the sights of the Negev when I spent six months here when I was 19 (in the army). Since then we have been caming here many times over the years, and in 2002 the annual meeting of the Israeli Mathematical Union took place here, in the same hotel.</p>

<p>One anecdote about the Israeli election is that both major political parties of Israel, the Likud, led by Benjamin (Bibi) Netanyahu that won 35 seats in the parliament and will probably lead the coalition, and the newly formed “Blue-and-White” party, led by Benny (Benjamin) Gantz that also won 35 seats and will probably lead the opposition, stand behind quantum computing! <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

 Last year I took some time off to study online convex optimization in some detail. The reason for doing that was similar to the reason why at some point I took time off to study spectral graph theory: it was coming up in several papers that I wanted to understand, and I felt that I was missing out by not mastering an important tool. In particular, I wanted to understand: </p>
<ol>
<li> The <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1496770.1496899">Barak-Hardt-Kale</a> proof of the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/492584">Impagliazzo hard-core lemma</a>.
</li><li> The online convex optimization viewpoint on the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/548459">Frieze-Kannan weak regularity lemma</a>, on the dense model theorem of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4690942">(RTTV)</a>, and on the abstract weak regularity lemma of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5231258">(TTV)</a> that were described to me by Madhur Tulsiani a few years ago. Furthermore, I wanted to see if Russel Impagliazzo’s subsequent improvements to the dense model theorem and to the abstract weak regularity lemma could be recovered from this point of view.
</li><li> The <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2906142.2837020">Arora-Kale</a> algorithms for semidefinite programming, including their nearly linear-time algorithm for approximating the Goemans-Williamson relaxation of Max Cut.
</li><li> The meaning of the sentence “multiplicative weights and gradient descent are both special cases of follow-the-regularized-leader, using negative entropy and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell_2%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\ell_2^2}" class="latex" title="{\ell_2^2}" /> as regularizer, respectively.”
</li><li> The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04838">AllenZhu-Liao-Orecchia</a> online optimization proof of the Batson-Spielman-Srivastava sparsification result.
</li></ol>
<p>
I am happy to say that, except for the “furthermore” part of (2), I achieved my goals. To digest this material a bit better, I came up with the rather ambitious plan of writing a series of posts, in which I would alternate between (i) explaining a notion or theorem from online convex optimization (at a level that someone learning about optimization or machine learning might find useful) and (ii) explaining a complexity-theoretic application. Now that a very intense Spring semester is almost over, I plan to get started on this plan, although it is not clear that I will see it through the end. So stay tuned for the forthcoming first episode, which will be about the good old multiplicative weights algorithm.</p>

<p>Here are <i>in theory</i>‘s first ever book reviews! The books are</p>
<p>Giorgio Garuzzo<br />
<i>Quando in Italia si facevano i computer</i><br />
Available for free at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017PTTUKY">Amazon.com</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.it/Quando-facevano-computer-Giorgio-Garuzzo-ebook/dp/B017PTTUKY">Amazon.it</a>.</p>
<p>Giorgio Ausiello<br />
<i>The Making of a New Science</i><br />
Available from <a href="https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319626796">Springer</a>, as a DRM-free PDF through your academic library.</p>
<p>Both books talk about the early years of computing in Italy, on the industrial and academic side, respectively. They briefly intersect with the story of Olivetti’s Elea computer.</p>
<p><span id="more-4224"></span></p>
<p>Olivetti was a company that was founded in 1908 to make typewriters, and then branched out to other office/business machines and avionics. In the 1930s, Adriano Olivetti, a son of the founder Camillo Olivetti, took over the company. Adriano Olivetti was an unusual figure of entrepreneur deeply interested in arts, humanities and social sciences, with a utopian vision of a company reinvesting its profits in its community. In the 1950s, he led the company to develop the Elea, the first Italian computer. The Elea was made with transistors, and it came out before IBM had built its own first transistor-based computer.</p>
<p>The development of Elea was led by Mario Tchou. Mario Tchou was a Chinese-Italian born and raised in Rome, who studied electrical engineering at the Sapienza University of Rome and then at Brooklyn Polytechnic, eventually becoming an assistant professor at Columbia University. Olivetti persuaded Tchou to move back to Italy and lead the development of Elea, whose first prototype came out in 1957. </p>
<p>As production was ramping up, tragedy struck: Adriano Olivetti died in 1960, and Mario Tchou died in 1961. To shore up the finances of the company, the new CEO Roberto Olivetti brought in a series of new investors, who pushed to spin off the computer business.</p>
<p>At that point, Olivetti was working on another revolutionary machine, the P101, a programmable desktop calculator billed as the “first desktop computer,” which came out in 1964, attracting huge interest. Nonetheless the company spun off its “computer” division into a joint venture with GE, eventually divesting of it completely. Fortunately, they kept control of the P101 project, because those working on it were careful in branding it internally as a “calculator” (not part of the of deal with GE) rather than a “computer.”</p>
<p>These events are narrated, with a fascinating insider view, in Garuzzo’s book.</p>
<p>Giorgio Ausiello is one of the founding fathers of academic computer science in Italy. His book is a professional memoir that starts in the 1960s, at the time in which he started working on his undergraduate thesis at the Istituto Nazionale per le Applicazioni del Calcolo (INAC, later renamed IAC) at the National Research Council in Rome. At that point INAC had one of Italy’s few computers, a machine bought in 1954 from the Ferranti company in Manchester (when it was installed, it was Italy’s <i>second</i> computer).</p>
<p>As narrated in a <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2017/10/23/corrado-bohm/">previous post</a>, Mauro Picone, the mathematician who was leading INAC, brought Corrado Bohm to Rome to work on this computer, and Ausiello started to work with Bohm at the time in which he was just starting to think about models of computation and lambda-calculus.</p>
<p>Later, Ausiello visited Berkeley in the 1968-69 academic year, when Manuel Blum and Dick Karp had just joined the faculty. Ausiello took part in the first STOC, which was held in Marina del Rey in May 1969, and, later that month, he witnessed the occupation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Park_(Berkeley)">People’s Park</a> in Berkeley.</p>
<p>The Fall of 1969 marks the start of the first Italian undergraduate programs in Computer Science, in just four universities:  Bari, <del datetime="2019-04-17T11:04:18-07:00">Milan,</del> Pisa and Torino. Back in Italy from Berkeley, Ausiello continued to work at the National Research Council in Rome.</p>
<p>The book continues with a behind-the-scene narration of the events that led to the founding of the EATCS professional society, the ICALP conference and the TCS journal. There is also another trip to Berkeley in the 1980s, featuring Silvio Micali and Vijay Vazirani working on their matching algorithm, and Shafi Goldwasser just arriving in Berkeley.</p>
<p>Methodically documented and very detail-oriented, the book is a fascinating read, although it leaves you sometimes wanting to hear more about the personalities and the stories of the people involved and less about the attendance lists of certain meetings.</p>
<p>Even when it comes to the dryer details, however, I am happy that the books documents them and makes them available to future generations that will not have any living memory of the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>I should also mention that Alon Rosen has recently interviewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKCE7QnsFcw&amp;t=67s">Christos Papadimitriou</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GQnK6ys6C0&amp;t=20s">Avi Wigderson</a> and those (<i>long</i>) interviews are full of good stories. Finally, the Simons Foundation site has an <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2013/02/14/laszlo-lovasz/">interview of Laszlo Lovasz</a> in conversation with Avi Wigderson which I very highly recommend everybody to watch.</p></div>

the existing studies are developed to deal with itemset-based data. Different
from the itemset-based data, the time-ordered sequence data is more commonly
seen in real-world situations. Current utility mining algorithms have the
limitation when dealing with sequence data since they are time-consuming and
require large amount of memory usage. In this paper, we propose an efficient
Projection-based Utility Mining (ProUM) approach to discover high-utility
sequential patterns from sequence data. The utility-array structure is designed
to store necessary information of sequence-order and utility. By utilizing the
projection technique in generating utility-array, ProUM can significantly
improve the mining efficiency, and effectively reduce the memory consumption.
Besides, we propose a new upper bound named sequence extension utility. Several
pruning strategies are further applied to improve the efficiency of ProUM.
Experimental results show that the proposed ProUM algorithm significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.

A random variable $X$ is an $(n,k)$-zero-fixing source if for some subset $V\subseteq[n]$, $X$ is the uniform distribution on the strings $\{0,1\}^n$ that are zero on every coordinate outside of $V$. An $\epsilon$-extractor for $(n,k)$-zero-fixing sources is a mapping $F:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}^m$, for some $m$, such that $F(X)$ is $\epsilon$-close in statistical distance to the uniform distribution on $\{0,1\}^m$ for every $(n,k)$-zero-fixing source $X$. Zero-fixing sources were introduced by Cohen and Shinkar in~2015 in connection with the previously studied extractors for bit-fixing sources. They constructed, for every $\mu&gt;0$, an efficiently computable extractor that extracts a positive fraction of entropy, i.e., $\Omega(k)$ bits, from $(n,k)$-zero-fixing sources where $k\geq(\log\log n)^{2+\mu}$. 

In this paper we present two different constructions of extractors for zero-fixing sources that are able to extract a positive fraction of entropy for $k$ essentially smaller than $\log\log n$. The first extractor works for $k\geq C\log\log\log n$, for some constant $C$. The second extractor extracts a positive fraction of entropy for $k\geq \log^{(i)}n$ for any fixed $i\in \N$, where $\log^{(i)}$ denotes $i$-times iterated logarithm. The fraction of extracted entropy decreases with $i$. The first extractor is a function computable in polynomial time in~$n$ (for $\epsilon=o(1)$, but not too small); the second one is computable in polynomial time when $k\leq\alpha\log\log n/\log\log\log n$, where $\alpha$ is a positive constant.</div>

<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="822b">The year was 2005. I was applying for a PhD program in Computer Science in the top US universities. I have applied to 14 US universities. On Dec 2nd 2015, I received the following email (see the screenshot below) from the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), Penn Engineering, Office of Academic Programs, Graduate Admissions. I have redacted the name, email address and the phone numbers in the emails, to preserve their privacy.</p>
<p><img src="https://kintali.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/upenn1.png?w=660" alt="upenn1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1226" /></p>
<p>Here are the photos of the original transcript (I received from IIT Kharagpur when I graduated) and the additional transcripts (I received from IIT Kharagpur when I requested them for my PhD application). They are all <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">laminated by IIT Kharagpur</strong> and sent to me. Feel free to laugh at my appearance on the transcript. I do too <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p><img src="https://kintali.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/kgp.jpeg?w=660" alt="kgp" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1227" /></p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="e20e">IIT Kharagpur stated the following in their transcripts policy.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p" id="60be"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Institute does not take responsibility of sending the duplicate copy of grade cards (transcripts) directly to other institutions/organizations, in connection with the applicants’ admission/employment etc.”</em></p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a381">My reply to the above email and the response from UPenn are shown in the following screenshot.</p>
<p><img src="https://kintali.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/upenn2.png?w=660" alt="upenn2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1228" /></p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="1fc0">In Summary, UPenn was concerned that my transcript is laminated and opened. Surprised at their response (“Your application will not go any further with the opened transcript”), I have spent couple of hours searching online and discovered that there is a lot of scam involving fake degrees and fake transcripts. There are “professionals” in India and China creating the “highest quality fakes”. These fakes are often laminated. So, UPenn decided not to process any applications with opened and laminated credentials. All my credentials are valid and correct, but my application was not processed because IIT Kharagpur has no way to “securely send” valid transcripts and UPenn has no way to “efficiently validate applicants’ transcripts”.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0588">I have applied to 14 universities and some of them rejected me because ‘they found a better candidate’ or ‘the research group is not looking for new PhD students’ etc etc. But my UPenn application not going further because of an “inefficient and broken system” is frustrating, to say the least.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="291f">After a week, I have recovered from this frustration and went back to my daily routine of reading research papers on Theoretical Computer Science. I said to myself “I will get into one of the remaining 13 universities and I have to focus on research and resolve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">P vs NP problem</a>” <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bc4f"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">On a lighter note:</strong> There is a simple way to verify that my transcript is valid — ‘Simply open it and look at my grades’. I have received several B’s, some C’s and even couple of D’s. My CGPA is just average. Nobody in their right senses would create a fake transcript with those grades <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /> During the last decade, whenever I met any IITian I first set them up telling <a href="http://shivakintali.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">my credentials</a> (B-Tech from IIT Kharagpur, Masters from USC, PhD from GeorgiaTech, Taught at Princeton) and after they say “wow”, I bet with them that their CGPA at IIT is greater than mine. I never lost till date. I take pride in this fact <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /> In my defense, I was an all-rounder at IIT Kharagpur, balancing studies, serving as a ‘secretary of fine arts, modeling and dramatics’ of my hostel, painting, learning guitar and many more things.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d9e1"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A second incident:</strong> During summer 2010 (at the end of my fourth year as a PhD student at GeorgiaTech), I was offered an internship at Yahoo labs and the Yahoo HR team said they want to verify all my credentials (my IIT B-Tech degree, USC Master’s degree, work experience). Yahoo uses a third-party service to rigorously verify all credentials of potential employees / interns. <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/farewell-yahoo-ceo-scott-thompson-ousted-for-a-resume-lie" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Yahoo fired their own CEO</a> when they found that he lied in his resume. This process is very rigorous, but very time-consuming. The <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">verification of all my credentials took more than couple of months</strong>. Meanwhile, I was waiting with my fingers-crossed (figuratively speaking) and hoping these verifications happen soon, so that I can start my internship and earn some serious summer money for two months and see a bank balance of more than $1,000 dollars for the first time during my grad school <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f5fc">Later that year, when I discovered Bitcoin white paper and the underlying Blockchain, my first thought was to use the technology to build a ‘document integrity platform’ to issue tamper-proof credentials (degrees, transcripts, employment certificates, Visas, Identity documents, driver’s license etc), which can be verified instantaneously and securely on the blockchain.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="96cb">Early 2011, I got busy with writing thesis and joined the CS department Princeton University in September 2011. I have spent the first couple of years teaching at Princeton, mining Bitcoin, keeping track of Blockchain news and hoping that somebody will develop a ‘document integrity platform’. To my relief, some entrepreneurs tried to develop a ‘credential verification solutions’. To my frustration, none of those solutions are perfect. So I started preparing myself to become a full-time entrepreneur and left Princeton in summer 2015.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5810">Today, I am very glad we have a complete data integrity solution (for universities, employers and enterprises) and I am very excited that we are preventing fraud and corruption in several areas using our <a href="https://truecerts.co/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TrueCerts</a> platform.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e378">Every week I read several stories about fraud and corruption online (Eg: the recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_college_admissions_bribery_scandal" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">college admissions scandal</a>). I approach the involved parties and explain how such instances can be rigorously prevented using technology.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="d84e">I feel very fortunate to have discovered an exciting vision towards a fraud-free and efficient future. This discovery happened through the above mentioned unfortunate events. Sometimes the lowest points in your life have the greatest potential to show you the right path to your highest points.</p></div>

About a month ago (after my P NP poll appeared) I got email from Jacob Aron asking me some questions about it. One thing he was excited about was that the number of people who thought P vs NP would be solved in the next decade had increased from 11% to 22%. I told him that this also surprised me and <i>there had been no major advances to warrant that increase.</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
Then the article came out. Here is the pointer to the headline and the first few lines, the rest is behind a paywall<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2198151-we-could-solve-the-biggest-problem-in-maths-in-the-next-decade/">here</a><br />
<br />
You may notice that the headline is<br />
<br />
<i>We could solve the biggest problem in math in the next decade</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
I emailed Jacob to send me the article, which he did. The article was fine, even quoting me as saying that the increase of people who thought it would be solved soon was unwarranted.<br />
<br />
1) So, article fine, headline terrible.<br />
<br />
2)  A more honest headline would be<br />
<br />
<i>The Complexity Theory Community slightly more optimistic about when P vs NP will be resolved for no apparent reason.</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
3) More bad science:<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329780-400-turings-oracle-the-computer-that-goes-beyond-logic/">here</a><br />
<br />
Headline is<br />
<br />
<i>Turing's Oracle: The computer that goes beyond logic</i><br />
<br />
I think the article was about how a Turing Machine with an oracle for HALT can solve HALT. (If I am wrong about this let me know in the comments and I'll correct it.)<br />
<br />
4) More bad science:<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/finally-a-problem-that-only-quantum-computers-will-ever-be-able-to-solve-20180621/">here</a><br />
<br />
Headline<br />
<br />
<i>Finally, a problem that only Quantum Computers will ever be able to solve.</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
This was about the oracle such that BQP is not in PH. Really!<br />
<br />
5) I invite you to add your own.<br />
<br />
6) OKAY, so why is the press SO BAD at reporting on our field? And is it just our field? I have one explanation, though I am sure there are many.<br />
<br />
Our field is about showing the LIMITS of computation. Its hard to make that sexy so they ... lie? exaggerate. They themselves don't really understand our field? Note:<br />
<br />
To explain to someone who does not really know CS why its important to have an oracle where BQP is not in PH is hard<br />
<br />
To explain this to someone IN CS but not in Theory is still hard!<br />
<br />
To explain this to someone IN CS and even in CS Theory, but not complexity (e.g., algorithms) might be hard, though it may depend on the person.<br />
<br />
7) The old saying is `I don't care if you get the story wrong so long as you spell my name right' And indeed, they did spell my name right. So there is that! But more seriously and less about me or even the article that refers to my poll--- is it bad that science reporting is often wrong?<br />
<br />

<p>When humans interact with the environment, we receive a series of signals that indicate the value of our actions. We know that chocolate tastes good, sunburns feel bad, and certain actions generate praise or disapproval from others. Generally speaking, we learn from these signals and adapt our behavior in order to get more positive “rewards” and fewer negative ones.</p>
<p><i>Reinforcement learning</i> (RL) is a sub-field of machine learning that formally models this setting of learning through interaction in a reactive environment. In RL, we have an <b>agent</b> and an <b>environment</b>. The agent observes its position (or “state”) in the environment and takes actions that transition it to a new state. The environment looks at an agent’s state and hands out rewards based on a hidden set of criteria.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/null.png?w=360&amp;h=145" alt="" title="" width="360" height="145" /></p>
<p><i>Source: <a href="http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf">Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction</a>. Sutton &amp; Barto, 2017.</i></p>
<p>Typically, the goal of RL is for the agent to learn behavior that maximizes<i> </i>the total reward it receives from the environment. This methodology has led to some notable successes: machines have learned how to<a href="https://deepmind.com/research/publications/playing-atari-deep-reinforcement-learning/"> play Atari games</a>, how to <a href="https://sigmoidal.io/alphago-how-it-uses-reinforcement-learning-to-beat-go-masters/">beat human masters</a> of Go, and how to write <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18224704/ai-machine-learning-language-models-read-write-openai-gpt2">long-form responses</a> to an essay prompt.</p>
<h2>But what can we learn without an external reward signal?</h2>
<p>It seems like a paradoxical question to ask, given that RL is all about rewards. But even though the reward paradigm is fundamentally flexible in many ways, it is also brittle and limits the agent’s ability to learn about its environment. This is due to several reasons. First, a reward signal directs the agents towards a single specific goal that may not generalize. Second, the reward signal may be sparse and uninformative, as we illustrate below.</p>
<p>Imagine that you want a robot to learn to navigate through the following maze.</p>
<p><b>Case 1: Sparse Rewards.</b> The agent gets a reward of +1 when it exits the maze, and a reward of 0 everywhere else. The agent doesn’t learn anything until it stumbles upon the exit.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">⇒ Clear reward signals are not always available.</p>
<p><b>Case 2: Misleading Rewards.</b> The agent gets a reward of +1 at the entrance and a reward of +10 at the exit. The agent incorrectly learns to sit at the entrance because it hasn’t explored its environment sufficiently.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">⇒ Rewards can <i>prevent</i> discovery of the full environment.</p>
<p>These issues are easy to overcome in the small maze on the left. But what about the maze on the right? As the size of the environment grows, it’ll get harder and harder to find the correct solution — the intractability of the problem scales exponentially.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/image.png?w=244&amp;h=238" alt="" title="" width="244" height="238" /><img src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/pasted-image-0.png?w=1100" alt="pasted image 0.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-130" /></p>
<p>So what we find is that there is power<i> </i>in being able to learn effectively in the <b>absence</b> of rewards. This intuition is supported by a body of research that shows learning fails when rewards aren’t dense or are <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/cs287-fa09/readings/NgHaradaRussell-shaping-ICML1999.pdf">poorly shaped</a>; and fixing these problems can require substantial engineering effort.</p>
<p>By enabling agents to discover the environment without the requirement of a reward signal, we create a more<b> flexible and generalizable</b> form of reinforcement learning. This framework can be considered a form of “unsupervised” RL. Rather than relying on explicit and inherently limited signals (or “labels”), we can deal with a broad, unlabelled pool of data. Learning from this pool facilitates a more general extraction of knowledge from the environment.</p>
<h2>Our new approach: Maximum Entropy</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02690">recent work</a>, we propose finding a policy that maximizes entropy (which we refer to as a MaxEnt policy), or another related and concave function of the distribution. This objective is reward-independent and favors exploration.</p>
<p>In the video below, a two-dimensional cheetah robot learns to run backwards and forwards, move its legs fast and in all different directions, and even do flips. The cheetah doesn’t have access to any external rewards; it only uses signals from the MaxEnt policy.</p>
<p> </p>
<div style="width: 1100px; height: 620px;" class="video-player" id="v-ro0BDWO4-1">
</div>
<p>Entropy is a function of the distribution over states. A high entropy distribution visits all states with near-equal frequency — it’s a <i>uniform</i> distribution. On the other hand, a low entropy distribution is biased toward visiting some states more frequently than others. (In the maze example, a low entropy distribution would result from the agent sitting at the entrance of the maze forever.)</p>
<p><img src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/sladx3i4fcsebwejbiohb_g.png?w=1100" alt="slAdX3I4FcseBWeJbioHb_g.png" class=" size-full wp-image-129 aligncenter" /></p>
<p>So given that policy <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\pi" class="latex" title="\pi" /> creates a distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d_%5Cpi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="d_\pi" class="latex" title="d_\pi" /> over states, the problem we are hoping to solve is:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%5E%2A+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmax_%7B%5Cpi%7D+%5Ctext%7Bentropy%7D%28d_%5Cpi%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\pi^* = \arg \max_{\pi} \text{entropy}(d_\pi) " class="latex" title="\pi^* = \arg \max_{\pi} \text{entropy}(d_\pi) " /></p>
<p>When we know all the states, actions, and dynamics of a given environment, finding the policy with maximum entropy is a concave optimization problem. This type of problem can be easily and exactly solved by convex programming.</p>
<p>But we very rarely have all that knowledge available to use. In practice, one of several complications usually arise:</p>
<ol>
<li>The states are <b>non-linearly approximated </b>by a neural network or some other function approximator.</li>
<li>The transition dynamics are unknown.</li>
<li>The state space is intractably large. (As an interesting example, the game of Go has more than<b> one googol or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B100%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="10^{100}" class="latex" title="10^{100}" /></b> possible states. That’s more than the number of atoms in the universe, according to <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/01/alphago-mastering-ancient-game-of-go.html">this blog</a> from 2016, and definitely more than can fit on a computer.)</li>
</ol>
<p>In such cases, the problem of finding a max-entropy policy becomes non-convex and computationally hard.</p>
<p>So what to do? If we look at many practical RL problems (Atari, OpenAI Gym), we see that there are many known, efficient solvers that can construct an optimal (or nearly-optimal) policy when they are <i>given a reward signal</i>.</p>
<p>We thus consider an <i>oracle model</i>: let’s assume that we have access to one of these solvers, so that we can pass it an explicit reward vector and receive an optimal policy in return. Can we now maximize entropy in a provably efficient way? In other words, is it possible to reduce this high complexity optimization problem to that of “standard” RL?</p>
<p>Our approach does exactly that! It is based on the Frank-Wolfe method. This is a gradient-based optimization algorithm that is particularly suited for oracle-based optimization. Instead of moving in the direction of the steepest decline of the objective function, the Frank-Wolfe method iteratively moves in the direction of the optimal point in the direction of the gradient. This is depicted below (and deserves a separate post…). The Frank-Wolfe method is a projection-free algorithm, see <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GIDnw7T-NT4Do3eC0B5kYJlzwOs6nzIO/view">this exposition</a> about its theoretical properties.</p>

<p>To complement the theory, we also created some experiments to test the MaxEnt algorithm on simulated robotic locomotion tasks (<a href="https://github.com/abbyvansoest/maxent/tree/refactor">open source code available here</a>). We used test environments from <a href="https://gym.openai.com/">OpenAI Gym</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py">Mujoco</a> and trained MaxEnt experts for various environments.</p>
<p>These are some results from the Humanoid experiment, where the agent is a human-like bipedal robot. The behavior of the MaxEnt agent (blue) is baselined against a random agent (orange), who explores by sampling randomly from the environment. This random approach is often used in practice for epsilon-greedy RL exploration.</p>

<p>In this figure, we see that over the course of 25 epochs, the MaxEnt agent progressively increases the total entropy over the state space.</p>

<p>Here, we see a visualization of the Humanoid’s coverage of the $xy$-plane, where the shown plane is of size 40-by-40. After one epoch, there is <b>minimal</b> coverage of the area. But by the 5th, 10th, and 15th epoch, we see that the agent has learned to visit all the different states in the plane, obtaining full and nearly uniform coverage of the grid!</p>

<p>Color the points of an  grid with two colors. How big a monochromatic grid-like subset can you find? By “grid-like” I mean that it should be possible to place equally many horizontal and vertical lines, partitioning the plane into  cells each of which contains a single point.</p>

<p>So for the coloring of the  grid below, there are several  monochromatic grid-like subsets. The image below shows one, and the completely red and blue southwest and northeast quadrants provide two others.
The blue quadrant prevents any red grid-like subset from being larger than , and vice versa, so these are the largest grid-like subsets in this grid.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/subgrid.svg" alt="Monochromatic grid-like subset in a colored grid" /></p>

<p>It’s not hard to prove that there always exists a monochromatic grid-like subset of size at least .
Just use vertical and horizontal lines to partition the big grid into blocks of that size. If one of those blocks is monochromatic, then it’s the grid-like subset you’re looking for. And if not, you can choose a red point from each block to get a grid-like subset of the same size.</p>

<p>In the other direction, there exist colorings of an  grid for which the largest monochromatic grid-like subset has size only a little bigger, . To find such a coloring, partition the big grid into square blocks of size , and make each block monochromatic with a randomly chosen color.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/blocked-coloring.svg" alt="Coloring a grid by dividing into square blocks and coloring each block randomly" /></p>

<p>Now, consider any partition by axis-parallel lines into (irregular) rectangles, each containing one of the points of a grid-like subset.  Only one row or column of the rectangles can cross each line of the partition into square blocks, so the number of rectangles that include parts of two or more square blocks is . Any remaining rectangles of the partition must come from a grid-like subset of square blocks that are all colored the same as each other. But with a random coloring, the expected size of this largest monochromatic subset of square blocks is . Therefore, the number of rectangles that stay within a single square block is limited to the total number of points in this grid-like subset of square blocks, which is again .</p>

<p>I’m not sure how to eliminate the remaining  gap between these two bounds, or which way it should go.</p>

<p>One application of these ideas involves the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpattern">superpatterns</a>, permutations that contain as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_pattern">pattern</a> every smaller permutation up to some size .
If  is a superpattern for the permutations of size , then we can obtain a point set by interpreting the position and value of each element of  as Cartesian coordinates. This point set includes a grid-like subset of size , coming from a permutation of size  that translates to a grid-like set of points.
If the elements of the superpattern are colored with two colors, there still exists a monochromatic grid-like subset of size .
And this monochromatic grid-like subset corresponds to a superpattern, for permutations of size . So, whenever the elements of a superpattern are colored with two (or finitely many) colors, there remains a monochromatic subset of elements that is still a superpattern for permutations of some smaller but non-constant size.</p>

For quantified Boolean formulas (QBF), a resolution system with a symmetry rule was recently introduced by Kauers and Seidl (Inf. Process. Lett. 2018). In this system, many formulas hard for QBF resolution admit short proofs.

Kauers and Seidl apply the symmetry rule on symmetries of the original formula. Here we propose a new formalism where symmetries are dynamically recomputed during the proof on restrictions of the original QBF. This presents a theoretical model for the potential use of symmetry learning as an inprocessing rule in QCDCL solving.

We demonstrate the power of symmetry learning by proving an exponential separation between Q-resolution with the symmetry rule and Q-resolution with our new symmetry learning rule. In fact, we show that bounding the number of symmetry recomputations gives rise to a hierarchy of QBF resolution systems of strictly increasing strength.</div>

A locally decodable code (LDC) C:{0,1}^k -&gt; {0,1}^n is an error correcting code wherein individual bits of the message can be recovered by only querying a few bits of a noisy codeword. LDCs found a myriad of applications both in theory and in practice, ranging from probabilistically checkable proofs to distributed storage. However, despite nearly two decades of extensive study, the best known constructions of O(1)-query LDCs have super-polynomial blocklength.

The notion of relaxed LDCs is a natural relaxation of LDCs, which aims to bypass the foregoing barrier by requiring local decoding of nearly all individual message bits, yet allowing decoding failure (but not error) on the rest. State of the art constructions of O(1)-query relaxed LDCs achieve blocklength n = O(k^{1+ \gamma}) for an arbitrarily small constant \gamma.

We prove a lower bound which shows that O(1)-query relaxed LDCs cannot achieve blocklength n = k^{1+ o(1)}. This resolves an open problem raised by Ben-Sasson, Goldreich, Harsha, Sudan, and Vadhan (STOC 2004).</div>

<p>The study of entanglement through the length of interactive proof systems has been one of the most productive applications of complexity theory to the physical sciences that I know of. Last week Anand Natarajan and John Wright, postdoctoral scholars at Caltech and MIT respectively, added a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05870">major stone</a> to this line of work. Anand &amp; John (hereafter “NW”) establish the following wild claim: it is possible for a classical polynomial-time verifier to decide membership in any language in <em>non-deterministic doubly exponential time</em> by asking questions to two infinitely powerful, but untrusted, provers sharing entanglement. In symbols, NEEXP <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csubseteq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\subseteq}" class="latex" title="{\subseteq}" /> MIP<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{^\star}" class="latex" title="{^\star}" />! (The last symbol is for emphasis — no, we don’t have an MIP<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{^\star}" class="latex" title="{^\star}" />! class — yet.)</p>
<p>What is amazing about this result is the formidable gap between the complexity of the verifier and the complexity of the language being verified. We know since the 90s that the use of interaction and randomness can greatly expand the power of polynomial-time verifiers, from NP to <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=146609">PSPACE</a> (with a single prover) and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2794945">NEXP</a> (with two provers). As a result of the work of Natarajan and Wright, we now know that yet an additional ingredient, the use of <em>entanglement</em> between the provers, can be leveraged by the verifier — the same verifier as in the previous results, a classical randomized polynomial-time machine — to obtain an exponential increase in its verification power. Randomness and interaction brought us one exponential; entanglement gives us another.</p>
<p>To gain intuition for the result consider first the structure of a classical two-prover one-round interactive proof system for non-deterministic doubly exponential time, with exponential-time verifier. Cutting some corners, such a protocol can be obtained by “scaling up” a standard two-prover protocol for non-deterministic singly exponential time. In the protocol, the verifier would sample a pair of exponential-length questions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" title="{(X,Y)}" />, send <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> to each prover, receive answers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" />, and perform an exponential-time computation that verifies some predicate about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%2CA%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(X,Y,A,B)}" class="latex" title="{(X,Y,A,B)}" />.</p>
<p>How can entanglement help design an <em>exponentially more efficient</em> protocol? At first it may seem like a polynomial-time verifier has no way to even get started: if it can only communicate polynomial-length messages with the provers, how can it leverage their power? And indeed, if the provers are classical, it can’t: it is known that even with a polynomial number of provers, and polynomially many rounds of interaction, a polynomial-time verifier cannot decide any language beyond NEXP.</p>
<p>But the provers in the NW protocol are not classical. They can share entanglement. How can the verifier exploit this to its advantage? The key property that is needed is know as the <em>rigidity</em> of entanglement. In words, rigidity is the idea that by verifying the presence of certain statistical correlations between the provers’ questions and answers the verifier can determine precisely (up to a local change of basis) the quantum state and measurements that the provers must have been using to generate their answers. The most famous example of rigidity is the <em>CHSH game</em>: as already shown by <a href="http://www.numdam.org/item/AIHPA_1988__49_2_215_0/">Werner and Summers</a> in 1982, the CHSH game can only be optimally, or even near-optimally, won by measuring a maximally entangled state using two mutually unbiased bases for each player. No other state or measurements will do, unless they trivially imply an EPR pair and mutually unbiased bases (such as a state that is the tensor product of an EPR pair with an additional entangled state).</p>
<p>Rigidity gives the verifier control over the provers’ use of their entanglement. The simplest use of this is for the verifier to force the provers to share a certain number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" /> of EPR pairs and measure them to obtain identical uniformly distributed <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" />-bit strings. Such a test for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" /> EPR pairs can be constructed from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" /> CHSH games. In a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03821">paper</a> with Natarajan we give a more efficient test that only requires questions and answers of length that is poly-logarithmic in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" />. Interestingly, the test is built on classical machinery — the low-degree test — that plays a central role in the analysis of some classical multi-prover proof systems for NEXP.</p>
<p>At this point we have made an inch of progress: it is possible for a polynomial-time (in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3D%5Clog+N%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n=\log N}" class="latex" title="{n=\log N}" />) verifier to “command” two quantum provers sharing entanglement to share <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%3D2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N=2^n}" class="latex" title="{N=2^n}" /> EPR pairs, and measure them in identical bases to obtain identical uniformly random <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" />-bit strings. What is this useful for? Not much — yet. But here comes the main insight in NW: suppose we could similarly force the provers to generate, not identical uniformly random strings, but a pair of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" />-bit strings <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" title="{(X,Y)}" /> that is distributed as a pair of questions from the verifier in the aforementioned interactive proof system for NEEXP with exponential-time (in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />) verifier. Then we could use a polynomial-time (in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />) verifier to “command” the provers to generate their exponentially-long questions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" title="{(X,Y)}" /> by themselves. The provers would then compute answers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28A%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(A,B)}" class="latex" title="{(A,B)}" /> as in the NEEXP protocol. Finally, they would prove to the verifier, using a polynomial interaction, that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28A%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(A,B)}" class="latex" title="{(A,B)}" /> is a valid pair of answers to the pair of questions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" title="{(X,Y)}" /> — indeed, the latter verification is an NEXP problem, hence can be verified using a protocol with polynomial-time verifier.</p>
<p>Sounds crazy? Yes. But they did it! Of course there are many issues with the brief summary above — for example, how does the verifier even know the questions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%2CY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X,Y}" class="latex" title="{X,Y}" /> sampled by the provers? The answer is that it doesn’t need to know the entire question; only that it was sampled correctly, and that the quadruple <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%2CA%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(X,Y,A,B)}" class="latex" title="{(X,Y,A,B)}" /> satisfies the verification predicate of the exponential-time verifier. This can be verified using a polynomial-time interactive proof.</p>
<p>Diving in, the most interesting insight in the NW construction is what they call “introspection”. What makes multi-prover proof systems powerful is the ability for the verifier to send correlated questions to the provers, in a way such that each prover has only partial information about the other’s question — informally, the verifier plays a variant of prisonner’s dilemma with the provers. In particular, any interesting distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" title="{(X,Y)}" /> will have the property that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> are not fully correlated. For a concrete example think of the “planes-vs-lines” distribution, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> is a uniformly random plane and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> a uniformly random line in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" />. The aforementioned test for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" /> EPR pairs can be used to force both provers to sample the same uniformly random plane <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" />. But how does the verifier ensure that one of the provers “forgets” parts of the plane, to only remember a uniformly random line <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> that is contained in it? NW’s insight is that the information present in a quantum state — such as the prover’s half-EPR pairs — can be “erased” by commanding the prover to perform a measurement in the <em>wrong</em> basis — a basis that is mutually unbiased with the basis used by the other prover to obtain its share of the query. Building on this idea, NW develop a battery of delicate tests that provide the verifier the ability to control precisely what information gets distributed to each prover. This allows a polynomial-time verifier to perfectly simulate the local environment that the exponential-time verifier would have created for the provers in a protocol for NEEXP, thus simulating the latter protocol with exponentially less resources.</p>
<p>One of the aspects of the NW result I like best is that they showed how the “history state barrier” could be overcome. Previous works attempting to establish strong lower bounds on the class MIP<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{^\star}" class="latex" title="{^\star}" />, such as the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12166">paper</a> by Yuen et al., relies on a compression technique that requires the provers to share a history state of the computation performed by a larger protocol. Unfortunately, history states are very non-robust, and as a result such works only succeeded in developing protocols with vanishing completeness-soundness gap. NW entirely bypass the use of history states, and this allows them to maintain a constant gap.</p>
<p>Seven years ago Tsuyoshi Ito and I showed that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0550">MIP<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7D%5E%5Cstar&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{}^\star" class="latex" title="{}^\star" /> contains NEXP</a>. At the time, we thought this may be the end of the story — although it seemed challenging, surely someone would eventually prove a matching upper bound. Natarajan and Wright have defeated this expectation by showing that MIP<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{^\star}" class="latex" title="{^\star}" /> contains NEEXP. What next? NEEEXP? The halting problem? I hope to make this the topic of a future post.</p></div>

<p>I was saddened about the results of the Israeli election.  The Beresheet lander, which lost its engine and crashed onto the moon as I was writing this, seems like a fitting symbol for where the country is now headed.  Whatever he was at the start of his career, Netanyahu has become the Israeli Trump—a breathtakingly corrupt strongman who appeals to voters’ basest impulses, sacrifices his country’s future and standing in the world for short-term electoral gain, considers himself unbound by laws, recklessly incites hatred of minorities, and (despite zero personal piety) cynically panders to religious fundamentalists who help keep him in power.  Just like with Trump, it’s probably futile to hope that lawyers will swoop in and free the nation from the demagogue’s grip: legal systems simply aren’t designed for assaults of this magnitude.</p>



<p>(If, for example, you were designing the US Constitution, how would you guard against a presidential candidate who <em>openly</em> supported and was supported by a hostile foreign power, and won anyway?  Would it even occur to you to include such possibilities in your definitions of concepts like “treason” or “collusion”?)</p>



<p>The original Zionist project—the secular, democratic vision of Herzl and Ben-Gurion and Weizmann and Einstein, which the Nazis turned from a dream to a necessity—matters more to me than most things in this world, and that was true even before I’d spent time in Israel and before I had a wife and kids who are Israeli citizens.  It would be depressing if, after a century of wildly improbable victories against external threats, Herzl’s project were finally to eat itself from the inside.  Of course I have analogous worries (scaled up by two orders of magnitude) for the US—not to mention the UK, India, Brazil, Poland, Hungary, the Philippines … the world is now engaged in a massive test of whether Enlightenment liberalism can long endure, or whether it’s just a metastable state between one Dark Age and the next.  (And to think that people have accused me of uncritical agreement with Steven Pinker, the world’s foremost optimist!)</p>



<p>In times like this, one takes one’s happiness where one can find it.</p>



<p>So, yeah: I’m happy that there’s now an “image of a black hole” (or rather, of radio waves being bent around a black hole’s silhouette).  If you really want to understand what the now-ubiquitous image is showing, I strongly recommend <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/09/a-non-experts-guide-to-a-black-holes-silhouette/">this guide</a> by Matt Strassler.</p>



<p>I’m happy that integer multiplication can apparently <a href="https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~davidharvey/papers/nlogn/">now be done</a> in O(n log n), capping a decades-long quest (see also <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/03/29/integer-multiplication-in-nlogn-time/">here</a>).</p>



<p>I’m happy that there’s now apparently a spectacular fossil record of the first minutes after the asteroid impact that ended the Cretaceous period.  Even better will be if this finally proves that, yes, some non-avian dinosaurs were still alive on impact day, and had not gone extinct due to unrelated climate changes slightly earlier.  (Last week, my 6-year-old daughter sang a song in a school play about how “no one knows what killed the dinosaurs”—the verses ran through the asteroid and several other possibilities.  I wonder if they’ll retire that song next year.)  If you haven’t yet read it, the <em><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/the-day-the-dinosaurs-died">New Yorker</a></em><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/the-day-the-dinosaurs-died"> piece on this</a> is a must.</p>



<p>I’m happy that my good friend Zach Weinersmith (legendary author of <a href="http://smbc-comics.com/">SMBC Comics</a>), as well as the GMU economist Bryan Caplan (rabblerousing author of <em>The Case Against Education</em>, which I <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3678">reviewed here</a>), have a new book out: a graphic novel that makes a moral and practical case for open borders (!).  Their book is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Open-Borders-Science-Ethics-Immigration/dp/1250316979/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=A2TM1SK1AE3QXC3DEC99">now available for pre-order</a>, and at least at some point cracked Amazon’s top 10.  Just last week I met Bryan for the first time, when he visited UT Austin to give a talk based on the book.  He said that meeting me (having known me only from the blog) was like meeting a fictional character; I said the feeling was mutual.  And as for Bryan’s talk?  It felt great to spend an hour visiting a fantasyland where the world’s economies are run by humane rationalist technocrats, and where walls are going down rather than up.</p>



<p>I’m happy that, according to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/men-are-scum-inside-facebook-war-on-hate-speech?verso=true">this </a><em><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/men-are-scum-inside-facebook-war-on-hate-speech?verso=true">Vanity Fair</a></em><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/men-are-scum-inside-facebook-war-on-hate-speech?verso=true"> article</a>, Facebook will still ban you for writing that “men are scum” <em>or</em> that “women are scum”—having ultimately rejected the demands of social-justice activists that it ban only the latter sentence, not the former.  According to the article, everyone on Facebook’s Community Standards committee agreed with the activists that this was the right result: dehumanizing comments about women have no place on the platform, while (superficially) dehumanizing comments about men are an important part of feminist consciousness-raising that require protection.  The problem was simply that the committee couldn’t come up with any <em>general principle</em> that would yield that desired result, without also yielding bad results in other cases.</p>



<p>I’m happy that the 737 Max jets are grounded and will hopefully be fixed, with no thanks to the FAA.  Strangely, while this was still the top news story, I gave a short talk about quantum computing to a group of Boeing executives who were visiting UT Austin on a previously scheduled trip.  The title of the session they put me in?  “Disruptive Computation.”</p>



<p>I’m happy that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg">Greta Thunberg</a>, the 15-year-old Swedish climate activist, has attracted a worldwide following and might win the Nobel Peace Prize.  I hope she does—and more importantly, I hope her personal story will help galvanize the world into accepting things that it already knows are true, as with the example of Anne Frank (or for that matter, Gandhi or MLK).  Confession: back when I was an adolescent, I often daydreamed about doing exactly what Thunberg is doing right now, leading a worldwide children’s climate movement.  I didn’t, of course.  In my defense, I wouldn’t have had the charisma for it anyway—and also, I got sidetracked by even more pressing problems, like working out the quantum query complexity of recursive Fourier sampling.  But fate seems to have made an excellent choice in Thunberg.  She’s not the prop of any adult—just a nerdy girl with Asperger’s who formed the idea to sit in front of Parliament every day to protest the destruction of the world, because she couldn’t understand why everyone else wasn’t.</p>



<p>I’m happy that the college admissions scandal has finally forced Americans to confront the farcical injustice of our current system—a system where elite colleges pretend to peer into applicants’ souls (or the souls of the essay consultants hired by the applicants’ parents?), and where they preen about the moral virtue of their “holistic, multidimensional” admissions criteria, which amount in practice to shutting out brilliant working-class Asian kids in favor of legacies and rich badminton players.  Not to horn-toot, but Steven Pinker and I tried to raise the alarm about this travesty five years ago (see for example <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2003">this post</a>), and were both severely criticized for it.  I do worry, though, that people will draw <em>precisely</em> the wrong lessons from the scandal.  If, for example, a few rich parents resorted to outright cheating on the SAT—all their other forms of gaming and fraud apparently being insufficient—then the SAT itself must be to blame so we should get rid of it.  In reality, the SAT (whatever its flaws) is almost the only bulwark we have against the <em>complete</em> collapse of college admissions offices into nightclub bouncers.  <a href="https://quillette.com/2019/03/13/standardized-testing-and-meritocracy/?fbclid=IwAR0mvO48sFgBps3mrSJ0bdK-qGzmiFd06vG6Au6enANaBC5Qh_YAa9tloJY">This </a><em><a href="https://quillette.com/2019/03/13/standardized-testing-and-meritocracy/?fbclid=IwAR0mvO48sFgBps3mrSJ0bdK-qGzmiFd06vG6Au6enANaBC5Qh_YAa9tloJY">Quillette</a></em><a href="https://quillette.com/2019/03/13/standardized-testing-and-meritocracy/?fbclid=IwAR0mvO48sFgBps3mrSJ0bdK-qGzmiFd06vG6Au6enANaBC5Qh_YAa9tloJY"> article</a> says it much better than I can.</p>



<p>I’m happy that there will a <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/18-19/NP50">symposium from May 6-9</a> at the University of Toronto, to honor Stephen Cook and the (approximate) 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the discovery of NP-completeness.  I’m happy that I’ll be attending and speaking there.  If you’re interested, there’s still time to register!</p>



<p>Finally, I’m happy about the following “Sierpinskitaschen” baked by CS grad student and friend-of-the-blog <a href="https://twitter.com/optimistsinc?lang=en">Jess Sorrell</a>, and included with her permission (Jess says she got the idea from <a href="https://seattlelocalfood.com/2011/03/20/sierpinski-hamantaschen-sierpinskitaschen/?fbclid=IwAR1Qvoe8OYFXGbcke8u8XBS40tJMG2SkdJ8RI34u3CTSdjB2Fk1uob4OKzo">Debs Gardner</a>).</p>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
Elwyn R. Berlekamp entered this world on Sept 6, 1940, and left it on April 9, 2019.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elwyn_Berlekamp">Wikipedia</a> calls him <i>An American Mathematician</i> which seems to narrow to me. He worked on a variety of topics which were Math, Comp Sci, finance, and likely others --- if you know any that I missed leave comments.<br />
<br />
Here are some of the things he worked on:<br />
<br />
1) Factoring Polynomials over large finite fields (See <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2004849?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">here</a> from 1970)<br />
<br />
I quote the abstract<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
This paper reviews some of the known algorithms for factoring polynomials over finite fields and presents a new deterministic procedure for reducing the problem of factoring an arbitrary polynomial over the Galois field GP(p<sup>m</sup>) to the problem of finding roots in GF(p) of certain other polynomials over GP(p). The amount of computation and the storage space required by these algorithms are algebraic in both the degree of the polynomial to be factored and the log of the order of the field.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Certain observations on the application of these methods to factorization of polynomials over the rational integers are also included. </blockquote>
I think he meant what we would call polynomial time when he says algebraic.<br />
<br />
2) Combinatorial Games. He co-wrote the classic Winning Ways For your Mathematical Plays with John Conway and Richard Guy.  These books are like NIM on steroids. They are FUN and have some serious math in them. (My blog system thinks Combinatorial is not a word. It is wrong)<br />
<br />
3) Combinatorial Games. He was very interested in Go via Combinatorial Games. I have an article (alas, not online) by him entitled Introductory Overview of Mathematical Go Endgames.  There has been further work on this that is on the web, see <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~wqy/research/Honor%20Thesis.pdf">here</a>. I wonder what ERB would think of the ALPHAGO program.<br />
<br />
4) Berlekamp-Massey Algorithm finds the shortest linear feedback shift register for a given binary output sequence.<br />
<br />
5) Berlekamp-Welch Algorithm efficiently corrects errors in Reed-Solomon codes.  (Berlekamp also wrote a book on Algebraic Coding Theory.)<br />
<br />
6) I didn't know about his work in finance until I began writing this, but the following quote from Wikipedia is impressive<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
In 1989, Berlekamp purchased the largest interest in a trading company named Axcom Trading Advisors. After the firm's futures trading algorithms were rewritten, Axcom's Medallion Fund had a return (in 1990) of 55%, net of all management fees and transaction costs. The fund has subsequently continued to realize annualized returns exceeding 30% under management by James Harris Simons and his Renaissance Technologies Corporation.</blockquote></div>

<p>Draw a collection of quadrilaterals in the plane, meeting edge to edge, so that they don’t surround any open space (the region they cover is a topological disk) and every vertex interior to the disk touches at least four quadrilaterals. Is it always possible to color the corners of the quadrilaterals with four colors so that all four colors appear in each quadrilateral?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/colored-kinggraph.svg" alt="4-colored kinggraph" /></p>

<p>The graph of corners and quadrilateral edges is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaregraph">squaregraph</a> but this question is really about coloring a different and related graph, called a kinggraph, that also includes as edges the diagonals of each quad. It’s called that because one example of this kind of graph is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_graph">king’s graph</a> describing the possible moves of a chess king on a chessboard.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/kings-graph.svg" alt="The king's graph" /></p>

<p>The king’s graph, and kinggraphs more generally, are examples of 1-planar graphs, graphs drawn in the plane in such a way that each edge is crossed at most once. The edges of the underlying squaregraph are not crossed at all, and the diagonals of each quad only cross each other. Squaregraphs are bipartite (like every planar graph in which all faces have an even number of edges), so they can be colored with only two colors. 1-planar graphs, in general, can require six colors (for instance you can draw the complete graph  as a 1-planar graph by adding diagonals to the squares of a triangular prism) and this is tight.
And you can easily 4-color the king’s graph by using two colors in alternation across the even rows of the chessboard, and a different two colors across the odd rows. So the number of colors for kinggraphs should be somewhere between these two extremes, but where?</p>

<p>One useful and general graph coloring method is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(graph_theory)">degeneracy</a> of graphs. This is the largest number  such that every subgraph has a vertex with at most  neighbors; one can use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_coloring">greedy coloring algorithm</a> to color any graph with  colors. Kinggraphs themselves always have a vertex with at most  neighbors, but unfortunately they do not have degeneracy . If you form a king’s graph on a  chessboard, and then remove its four corners, you get a subgraph in which all vertices have at least four neighbors.
This turns out to be as large as possible: every kinggraph has degeneracy at most four. This is because, if you consider the zones of the system of quads (strips of quads connected on opposite pairs of edges), there always exists an “outer zone”, a zone with nothing on one side of it (see the illustration, below). You can remove the vertices of the outer zone one at a time, in order from one end to the other, always removing a vertex of degree at most four, and then repeat on another outer zone until the whole graph is gone. So the degeneracy and greedy coloring method shows that you can 5-color every kinggraph, better than the 6-coloring that we get for arbitrary 1-planar graphs.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/outer-zone.svg" alt="An outer zone" /></p>

<p>This turns out to be optimal! For a while I thought that every kinggraph must be 4-colorable, because it was true of all the small examples that I tried. But it’s not true in general, and here’s why. If you look at the zones of the 4-colored kinggraph above, you might notice a pattern. The edges that connect pairs of quads from the same zone have colorings that alternate between two different pairs of colors. For instance, we might have a zone that has red–yellow edges alternating with blue–green edges, or another zone that has red–blue edges alternating with green–yellow edges. This is true whenever a kinggraph can be 4-colored. But there are only three ways of coloring a zone (that is, of partitioning the four colors into two disjoint pairs, which alternate along the zone). And when two zones cross each other, they must be colored differently. So every 4-coloring of a kinggraph turns into a 3-coloring of its zones. But the graph that describes the zones and its crossings is a triangle-free <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_graph">circle graph</a>, and vice versa: every triangle-free circle graph describes a kinggraph. And triangle-free circle graphs may sometimes need as many as five colors, in which case so does the corresponding kinggraph.</p>

<p>I posted <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2008/03/23/ageevs-squaregraph.html">an example of a squaregraph whose circle graph needs five colors</a> on this blog in 2008. Here’s a slightly different drawing of the same graph from <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2009/05/29/congratulations-dr-wortman.html">a later post</a>.
Because its circle graph is not 3-colorable, the corresponding kinggraph is not 4-colorable.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2009/cd220c.svg" alt="A squaregraph whose kinggraph is not 4-colorable" /></p>

<p>There are simpler examples of squaregraphs whose circle graph needs four colors. As long as the number of colors of the circle graph is more than three, the number of colors of the kinggraph will be more than four.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you can color the circle graph with three colors, then it’s also possible to translate this 3-coloring of zones back into a 4-coloring of the kinggraph. Just remove an outer zone, color the remaining graph recursively, add the removed zone back, and use the color of the zone you removed to decide which colors to assign to its vertices. Unfortunately, I don’t know the computational complexity of testing whether a circle graph is 3-colorable. There was a conference paper by Walter Unger in 1992 that claimed to have a polynomial time algorithm, but without enough details and it was never published in a journal. I think we have to consider the problem of finding a coloring as still being open.</p>

<p>The same method also leads to an easy calculation of the number of 4-colorings (in the same sense) of the usual kind of chessboard with  squares, or of a king’s graph with  vertices. In this case, the zones are just the rows and columns of the chessboard. We can use one color for the rows and two for the columns, or vice versa, so the number of 3-colorings of the zones (accounting for the fact that the 2-colorings get counted twice) is . And once the coloring of the zones is chosen, the coloring of the chessboard itself is uniquely determined by the color of any of its squares, so the total number of chessboard colorings is .</p>

The EATCS has just announced that <a href="https://pub.ist.ac.at/~tah/">Thomas Henzinger</a> is the <a href="http://eatcs.org/index.php/component/content/article/1-news/2811-the-eatcs-award-2019-laudatio-for-thomas-henzinger">EATCS Award 2019 recipient</a> for "fundamental contributions to the theory and practice of formal verification and synthesis of reactive, real-time, and hybrid computer systems, and to the application of formal methods to biological systems." Congratulations to  the award committee---consisting of Artur Czumaj, Marta Kwiatkowska and Christos Papadimitriou (chair)---for their great choice, to Tom for a very well deserved award and to the TCS community at large.<br /><br />Of course, Tom Henzinger needs no introduction. However, let me use this post to provide a bird's eye view of his career and of some of his many contributions to TCS, which would be enough for a good number of very successful research careers. The text below is largely due to <a href="http://di.ulb.ac.be/verif/jfr/">Jean-Francois Raskin</a>. <br /><br /><br /><b>Biographical sketch</b> Thomas A. Henzinger is the President of <a href="http://www.ist.ac.at/">IST Austria</a> (Institute of Science and Technology Austria), which, under his leadership, has quickly become one of the most impactful research institutes in the world. Before joining IST as its first president, Tom was Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Cornell University (1992-95), Assistant Professor (1996-97), Associate Professor (1997-98) and Professor (1998-2004) of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. He was also the Director of the Max-Planck Institute for Computer Science in Saarbruecken, Germany (1999) and Professor of Computer and Communication Sciences at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland (2004-09).<br /><br />Tom is an ISI highly cited researcher and his h-index is 103, according to <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jpgplxUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Google Scholar</a>. He is a member of Academia Europaea, a member of the German Academy of Sciences (Leopoldina), a member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, a Fellow of the AAAS, a Fellow of the EATCS, a Fellow of the ACM, and a Fellow of the IEEE. He was the recipient of the Milner Award of the Royal Society in 2015, of the Wittgenstein Award of the Austrian Science Fund and was granted an ERC Advanced Investigator Grant in 2010. He received the SIGPLAN POPL Most Influential Paper Award (2014), Logic in Computer Science Test-of-Time Award (2012), ACM SIGSOFT Impact Paper Award (2011), and Best Paper awards at SIGSOFT FSE and CONCUR.<br /><br /><b>Main scientific achievements</b> Tom's research focuses on modern systems theory, especially models, algorithms, and tools for the design and verification of reliable software, hardware and embedded systems. His <a href="https://pub.ist.ac.at/~tah/Publications/bytopic.html#hytech">HyTech tool </a>was the first model checker for mixed discrete-continuous systems.<br /><br />Tom has made a large number of fundamental contributions to theoretical computer science. Here I will limit myself to mentioning a small number of research areas where he has been particularly prolific and influential.<br /><ul><li><i><a href="https://pub.ist.ac.at/~tah/Publications/bytopic.html#real-time">The theory of timed and hybrid systems</a>.</i> Tom has defined and studied the expressiveness and the algorithmic complexity of several real-time extensions of temporal logics. He is one of the most important contributors to the <a href="https://pub.ist.ac.at/~tah/Publications/bytopic.html#hytech">theory of hybrid automata and to algorithms for the analysis of suchmodels</a>. His papers on the subject are among the most cited ones in the field of computer-aided verification. As an example, his paper “Symbolic model checking for real-time systems” received a LICS Test-of-Time Award in 2012. He has also studied the gap that exists between mathematical models of systems (e.g. hybrid automata) and their implementation on physical hardware. To bridge this gap, he developed models of physical platforms such as <a href="https://pub.ist.ac.at/~tah/Publications/bytopic.html#giotto">Giotto</a> and E-machines, and he devised ways to relate their semantics with the one of the abstract mathematical models.</li><li><i><a href="https://pub.ist.ac.at/~tah/Publications/bytopic.html#games">Games for verification and control</a>.</i> Tom has introduced the logic ATL*, which extends LTL and CTL* with the ability to reason about strategies that can be played by coalitions of agents/components in models of multi-agent/component systems. He has contributed to the understanding of the potential of adopting concepts from game theory for modeling and reasoning about open systems. He has contributed to a large number of algorithmic advances for solving game-graph problems and to better understand their computational complexity.</li><li><i>From Boolean models to quantitative models for verification and synthesis.</i> Tom has recently investigated how to shift from Boolean models to quantitative models. This research proposes quantitative generalizations of the paradigms that had success in reactive modeling, such as compositionality, property-preserving abstraction, model checking and synthesis. With those models, we can specify and reason about quantitative aspects, such as resource consumption, or compare the performance of different design solutions in embedded systems. He has obtained a substantial funding from the European Research Council to proceed along this promising line of research.</li><li><a href="https://pub.ist.ac.at/~tah/Publications/bytopic.html#blast"><i>Foundations of software model checking.</i></a> Tom has contributed substantially to the algorithms underlying the analysis of software systems by introducing the concept of lazy abstraction. Those ideas have been implemented in the highly influential tool Blast. This line of work was honoured with the Most Influential 2004 POPL Paper Award which he received in 2014.</li><li><a href="https://pub.ist.ac.at/~tah/Publications/bytopic.html#bio"><i>Computational modelling of biological systems.</i></a> Tom and his coworkers have shown that computational models are well suited to model the dynamics of biological systems. This is part of a broader research program that has the objective to show that concepts introduced to formalize reactive systems are helpful to model and reason about biological systems.</li></ul>Those important theoretical contributions have always been developed with relevant practical applications in mind. Consequently, Thomas Henzinger has not only worked on the foundations of our subject, but he also transferred his theoretical ideas into practice by developing tools and by suggesting methodologies that could be used in applying his theoretical results.<br /><br />Tom is a research leader who has had a profound influence on his PhD students and post-docs. To wit, several of his former students are now well-recognized researchers that enrich the life of our research community and now lead successful research groups.<br /><br /><b>Addendum 12 April 2019:</b> In case you are interested, you can find a short interview I had with Tom Henzinger a while back <a href="http://processalgebra.blogspot.com/2017/02/an-interview-with-thomas-henzinger.html">here</a>. <br /><br /></div>

Although a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28m%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="O(m)" class="latex" title="O(m)" />-time algorithm was postulated since 1974 [Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman], and despite its sibling problem of edge connectivity being resolved over two decades ago [Karger STOC’96], so far no vertex connectivity algorithms are faster than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E2%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="O(n^2)" class="latex" title="O(n^2)" /> time even for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%3D+4&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="k = 4" class="latex" title="k = 4" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m+%3D+O%28n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="m = O(n)" class="latex" title="m = O(n)" />. In the simplest case where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m+%3D+O%28n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="m = O(n)" class="latex" title="m = O(n)" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%3D+O%281%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="k = O(1)" class="latex" title="k = O(1)" />, the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E2%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="O(n^2)" class="latex" title="O(n^2)" /> bound dates five decades back to [Kleitman IEEE Trans. Circuit Theory’69]. For the general case, the best bound is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%28+%5Cmin%7B+kn%5E2%2C+n%5E%5Comega+%2B+nk%5E%5Comega+%7D+%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="\tilde{O}( \min{ kn^2, n^\omega + nk^\omega } )" class="latex" title="\tilde{O}( \min{ kn^2, n^\omega + nk^\omega } )" /> [Henzinger, Rao, Gabow FOCS’96; Linial, Lovász, Wigderson FOCS’86].</p>
<p>In this talk, I will present a randomized Monte Carlo algorithm with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%28m+%2B+k%5E3+n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="\tilde{O}(m + k^3 n)" class="latex" title="\tilde{O}(m + k^3 n)" /> time. This algorithm proves the conjecture by Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3DO%281%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="k=O(1)" class="latex" title="k=O(1)" /> up to a polylog factor, breaks the 50-year-old bound by Kleitman, is fastest for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4+%3C+k+%3C+n%5E%7B0.456%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="4 &lt; k &lt; n^{0.456}" class="latex" title="4 &lt; k &lt; n^{0.456}" />. The story is similar for the directed graphs where we obtain an algorithm running time at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%28k%5E2+m%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="\tilde{O}(k^2 m)" class="latex" title="\tilde{O}(k^2 m)" />.</p>
<p>The key to our results is to avoid computing single-source connectivity, which was needed by all previous exact algorithms and is not known to admit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%28n%5E2%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="o(n^2)" class="latex" title="o(n^2)" /> time. Instead, we design the first local algorithm for computing vertex connectivity; without reading the whole graph, our algorithm can find a separator of size at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" /> or certify that there is no separator of size at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" /> “near” a given seed node.</p>
<p>This talk is based on joint works with Danupon Nanongkai and Sorrachai Yingchareonthawornchai.</p></blockquote></div>

<p><em>[Guest post from Virginia Vassilevska Williams –Boaz]</em></p>



<p>Barna Saha, Sofya Raskhodnikova and I are organizing the second annual TCS Women event at STOC’19. We had an event at STOC’18 and it went really well. We envision an exciting program for the TCS Women event at STOC 2019. The details about the program are forthcoming.  The new TCS Women website is here: <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__sigact.org_tcswomen_&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&amp;r=CVsmSCuxoCwFoG2gFr0tpYyUk9r_oVDDLqgpNw-QTrM&amp;m=yF6ryOV_72RkpZ0_dg--Elo-VEADbvub3IKRqkerKEs&amp;s=sU7cAYjUogjxkGH7PXLNYC26FKcl0oYAZvIQjwBIQgc&amp;e=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://sigact.org/tcswomen/</a>. There you can learn more about our initiative.</p>



<p>In addition to the event, we have secured generous funding (similar to last year) from the NSF and industrial partners such as Akamai, Amazon, Google and Microsoft for <strong>travel grants</strong> for women and underrepresented minority students and postdocs to attend STOC. These grants are separate from the STOC travel awards and you can apply to both.</p>



<p>The application deadline for the TCS Women travel scholarship is <strong>April 25th, 2019</strong>. The information on how to apply is available here <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__sigact.org_tcswomen_tcs-2Dwomen-2Dtravel-2Dscholarship_&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&amp;r=CVsmSCuxoCwFoG2gFr0tpYyUk9r_oVDDLqgpNw-QTrM&amp;m=yF6ryOV_72RkpZ0_dg--Elo-VEADbvub3IKRqkerKEs&amp;s=8uERTRJZx4nz2kM7duDKIQl7pEyP1uP_TeaH-Qsu47U&amp;e=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://sigact.org/tcswomen/tcs-women-travel-scholarship/</a>. We hope to support as many women and underrepresented minority students and postdocs as possible all over the globe to come to STOC and FCRC. The participants will also have the opportunity to present their work at the STOC poster session.<br />If you are aware of eligible students (not only PhD) who are interested in attending STOC, please encourage them to apply.</p>



<p>Best wishes,</p>



<p>Virginia on behalf of the TCS Women organizers </p></div>

We prove an $\Omega(d \lg n/ (\lg\lg n)^2)$ lower bound on the dynamic cell-probe complexity of statistically $\mathit{oblivious}$ approximate-near-neighbor search (ANN) over the $d$-dimensional Hamming cube. For the natural setting of $d = \Theta(\log n)$, our result implies an $\tilde{\Omega}(\lg^2 n)$ lower bound, which is a quadratic improvement over the highest (non-oblivious) cell-probe lower bound for ANN. This is the first super-logarithmic $\mathit{unconditional}$ lower bound for ANN against general (non black-box) data structures. We also show that any oblivious $\mathit{static}$ data structure for decomposable search problems (like ANN) can be obliviously dynamized with $O(\log n)$ overhead in update and query time, strengthening a classic result of Bentley and Saxe (Algorithmica, 1980).</div>
