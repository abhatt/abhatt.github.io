<p><img width="1024" alt="kahn-kalai" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2022/04/kahn-kalai.webp" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22549" height="762" /></p>
<p>A brief summary: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17207">In the paper, A proof of the Kahn-Kalai conjecture,</a> <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jinyoungpark">Jinyoung Park</a> and <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~huypham/">Huy Tuan Pham</a> proved the 2006 expectation threshold conjecture posed by Jeff Kahn and me. The proof is wonderful. Congratulations Jinyoung and Huy Tuan!</p>
<p>The 2006 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0603218">expectation threshold conjecture</a> gives a justification for a naive way to estimate the threshold probability of a random graph property. Suppose that you are asked about the critical probability for a random graph in G(n,p) for having a perfect matching (or a Hamiltonian cycle). You compute the expected number of perfect matchings and realize that when p is C/n this expected number equals 1/2. (For Hamiltonian cycles it will be C’/n.) Of course, if the expectation is one half, the probability for a perfect matching can still be very low; indeed, in this case, an isolated vertex is quite likely but when there is no isolated vertices the expected number of perfect matchings is rather large. Our 2006 conjecture boldly asserts that the gap between the value given by such a naive computation and the true threshold value is at most logarithmic in the number of vertices. Jeff and I tried hard to find a counterexample but instead we managed to find more general and stronger forms of the conjecture that we could not disprove.</p>
<p>Two years ago Keith Frankston, Jeff Kahn, Bhargav Narayanan, and Jinyoung Park proved a weak form of the conjecture which was proposed in a 2010 paper by Michel Talagrand. (See <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/10/30/amazing-keith-frankston-jeff-kahn-bhargav-narayanan-jinyoung-park-thresholds-versus-fractional-expectation-thresholds/">this post</a>.) Indeed, the expectation threshold conjecture had some connections with a 1995 paper of Michel Talagrand entitled <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-0348-9090-8_25">Are all sets of positive measure essentially convex?</a> In a 2010 STOC paper <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.165.6973&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Are Many Small Sets Explicitly Small?</a> Michel formulated a whole array of interesting conjectures and commented that he feels that these conjectures are related to the expectation threshold conjecture to which he offered a weaker fractional version. This weak version suffices for various applications of the original conjecture. Keith, Jeff, Bhargav, and Jinyoung’s work built on the breakthrough work of Alweiss, Lovett, Wu and Zhang on the Erdős-Rado ‘sunflower’ conjecture. </p>
<p>Proving the full expectation threshold conjecture looked like a  difficult task. The only path that people saw was to try to relate Talagrand’s fractional expectation threshold with our expectation threshold. (Indeed Talagrand also conjectured that they only differ by a multiplicative constant factor. This looked if true very difficult to prove.)  However this is not the path taken by Jinyoung Park and Huy Tuan Pham and they found a direct simple argument! Jinyoung and Huy Tuan also used their method to settle one of the central conjectures (Conj 5.7) from <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.165.6973&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Talagrand’s paper</a> and this will be presented in a forthcoming paper.</p>
<p>The <em>logn</em> gap in our conjecture looked rather narrow but now that it was proved we can ask for conditions that will guarantee a smaller gap. For example, when is the gap only a constant?</p>

We prove that for every 3-player (3-prover) game $\mathcal G$ with value less than one, whose query distribution has the support $\mathcal S = \{(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)\}$ of hamming weight one vectors, the value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition $\mathcal G^{\otimes n}$ decays polynomially fast to zero; that is, there is a constant $c = c(\mathcal  G)&gt;0$ such that the value of the game $\mathcal  G^{\otimes n}$ is at most $n^{-c}$.
	
Following the recent work of Girish, Holmgren, Mittal, Raz and Zhan (STOC 2022), our result is the missing piece that implies a similar bound for a much more general class of multiplayer games: For $\textbf{every}$ 3-player game $\mathcal G$ over $\textit{binary questions}$ and $\textit{arbitrary answer lengths}$, with value less than 1, there is a constant $c = c(\mathcal G)&gt;0$ such that the value of the game $\mathcal G^{\otimes n}$ is at most $n^{-c}$.
	
Our proof technique is new and requires many new ideas. For example, we make use of the Level-$k$ inequalities from Boolean Fourier Analysis, which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been explored in this context prior to our work.</div>

read-once threshold functions. A read-once threshold formula can be defined by
a rooted tree, every internal node of which is labeled by a threshold function
$T_k^n$ (with output 1 only when at least $k$ out of $n$ input bits are 1) and
each leaf by a distinct variable. Such a tree defines a Boolean function in a
natural way. We focus on the randomized decision tree complexity of such
functions, when the underlying tree is a uniform tree with all its internal
nodes labeled by the same threshold function. We prove lower bounds of the form
$c(k,n)^d$, where $d$ is the depth of the tree. We also treat trees with
alternating levels of AND and OR gates separately and show asymptotically
optimal bounds, extending the known bounds for the binary case.

send discrete messages through a shared channel with sharply limited
communication. If two processors inadvertently send at the same time, the
messages collide and are not transmitted successfully. An important case is
acknowledgement-based contention resolution, in which processors cannot listen
to the channel at all; all they know is whether or not their own messages have
got through. This situation arises frequently in both networking and cloud
computing. One particularly important example of an acknowledgement-based
contention resolution protocol is binary exponential backoff. Variants of
binary exponential backoff are used in both Ethernet and TCP/IP, and both
Google Drive and AWS instruct their users to implement it to handle busy
periods.
</p>
<p>In queueing models, where each processor has a queue of messages, stable
acknowledgement-based protocols are already known (H{\aa}stad et al., SICOMP
1996). In queue-free models, where each processor has a single message but
processors arrive randomly, it is widely conjectured that no stable
acknowledgement-based protocols exist for any positive arrival rate of
processors. Despite exciting recent results for full-sensing protocols which
assume greater listening capabilities of the processors (see e.g. Bender et al.
STOC 2020 or Chen et al. PODC 2021), this foundational question remains open
even for backoff protocols unless the arrival rate of processors is at least
0.42 (Goldberg et al. SICOMP 2004). We prove the conjecture for all backoff
protocols outside of a tightly-constrained special case, and set out the
remaining technical obstacles to a full proof.

filters, require only an incremental filter that supports insertions but not
deletions. However, the design space of incremental filters is missing a "sweet
spot" filter that combines space efficiency, fast queries, and fast insertions.
Incremental filters, such as the Bloom and blocked Bloom filter, are not space
efficient. Dynamic filters (i.e., supporting deletions), such as the cuckoo or
vector quotient filter, are space efficient but do not exhibit consistently
fast insertions and queries.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose the prefix filter, an incremental filter that
addresses the above challenge: (1) its space (in bits) is similar to
state-of-the-art dynamic filters; (2) query throughput is high and is
comparable to that of the cuckoo filter; and (3) insert throughput is high with
overall build times faster than those of the vector quotient filter and cuckoo
filter by $1.39\times$-$1.46\times$ and $3.2\times$-$3.5\times$, respectively.
We present a rigorous analysis of the prefix filter that holds also for
practical set sizes (i.e., $n=2^{25}$). The analysis deals with the probability
of failure, false positive rate, and probability that an operation requires
accessing more than a single cache line.

While
there is extensive previous work on simulating finite-dimensional systems, less
is known about quantum algorithms for real-space dynamics. We conduct a
systematic study of such algorithms. In particular, we show that the dynamics
of a $d$-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger equation with $\eta$ particles can be
simulated with gate complexity $\tilde{O}\bigl(\eta d F
\text{poly}(\log(g'/\epsilon))\bigr)$, where $\epsilon$ is the discretization
error, $g'$ controls the higher-order derivatives of the wave function, and $F$
measures the time-integrated strength of the potential. Compared to the best
previous results, this exponentially improves the dependence on $\epsilon$ and
$g'$ from $\text{poly}(g'/\epsilon)$ to $\text{poly}(\log(g'/\epsilon))$ and
polynomially improves the dependence on $T$ and $d$, while maintaining best
known performance with respect to $\eta$. For the case of Coulomb interactions,
we give an algorithm using $\eta^{3}(d+\eta)T\text{poly}(\log(\eta
dTg'/(\Delta\epsilon)))/\Delta$ one- and two-qubit gates, and another using
$\eta^{3}(4d)^{d/2}T\text{poly}(\log(\eta dTg'/(\Delta\epsilon)))/\Delta$ one-
and two-qubit gates and QRAM operations, where $T$ is the evolution time and
the parameter $\Delta$ regulates the unbounded Coulomb interaction. We give
applications to several computational problems, including faster real-space
simulation of quantum chemistry, rigorous analysis of discretization error for
simulation of a uniform electron gas, and a quadratic improvement to a quantum
algorithm for escaping saddle points in nonconvex optimization.

Whereas algebraic dynamic data structures supporting edge updates and
reachability/distance queries have been known for quite a long time, they do
not, in general, allow reporting the underlying paths within the same time
bounds, especially against an adaptive adversary.
</p>
<p>In this paper we develop the first known fully dynamic reachability data
structures working against an adaptive adversary and supporting edge updates
and path queries for two natural variants: (1) point-to-point path reporting,
and (2) single-source reachability tree reporting. For point-to-point queries
in DAGs, we achieve $O(n^{1.529})$ worst-case update and query bounds, whereas
for tree reporting in DAGs, the worst-case bounds are $O(n^{1.765})$. More
importantly, we show how to lift these algorithms to work on general graphs at
the cost of increasing the bounds to $n^{1+5/6+o(1)}$ and making the update
times amortized. On the way to accomplishing that, we obtain two interesting
subresults. We give subquadratic fully dynamic algorithms for topological order
(in a DAG), and strongly connected components. To the best of our knowledge,
such algorithms have not been described before.
</p>
<p>Additionally, we provide deterministic incremental data structures for
reachability and shortest paths that handle edge insertions and report the
respective paths within subquadratic worst-case time bounds. For reachability
and $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate shortest paths in weighted digraphs, these
bounds match the best known dynamic matrix inverse-based randomized bounds for
fully dynamic reachability [v.d.Brand, Nanongkai and Saranurak, FOCS'19]. For
exact shortest paths in unweighted graphs, the obtained bounds in the
incremental setting polynomially improve upon the respective best known
randomized update/distance query bounds in the fully dynamic setting.

factorization, we consider the factorization problem for matrices of
polynomials and show the following results.
</p>
<p>(1) Given as input a full rank $d\times d$ matrix $M$ whose entries $M_{ij}$
are polynomials in the free noncommutative ring $\mathbb{F}_q\langle
x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n \rangle$, where each $M_{ij}$ is given by a noncommutative
arithmetic formula of size at most $s$, we give a randomized algorithm that
runs in time polynomial in $d,s, n$ and $\log_2q$ that computes a factorization
of $M$ as a matrix product $M=M_1M_2\cdots M_r$, where each $d\times d$ matrix
factor $M_i$ is irreducible (in a well-defined sense) and the entries of each
$M_i$ are polynomials in $\mathbb{F}_q \langle x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n \rangle$ that
are output as algebraic branching programs. We also obtain a deterministic
algorithm for the problem that runs in $poly(d,n,s,q)$.
</p>
<p>(2)A special case is the efficient factorization of matrices whose entries
are univariate polynomials in $\mathbb{F}[x]$. When $\mathbb{F}$ is a finite
field the above result applies. When $\mathbb{F}$ is the field of rationals we
obtain a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for the problem.

$S$ as their suffix. Two problems then come to mind; the first problem being
the counting of such substrings, and the second problem being the problem of
listing all such substrings. In this paper, we describe linear-time,
linear-space suffix tree-based algorithms for both problems. More specifically,
we describe an $O(|T| + |P|)$ time algorithm for the counting problem, and an
$O(|T| + |P| + \#(ans))$ time algorithm for the listing problem, where
$\#(ans)$ refers to the number of strings being listed in total, and $|P|$
refers to the total length of the strings in $P$. We also consider the reversed
version of the problems, where one prefix condition string and multiple suffix
condition strings are given instead, and similarly describe linear-time,
linear-space algorithms to solve them.

However,
these algorithms are computationally expensive in producing good quality
layouts for complex graphs. The layout quality is largely influenced by
execution time and methods' input parameters especially for large complex
graphs. The snapshots of visualization generated from these algorithms are
useful in presenting the current view or a past state of an information on
timeslices. Therefore, researchers often need to make a trade-off between the
quality of visualization and the selection of appropriate force-directed
algorithms. In this paper, we evaluate the quality of snapshots generated from
7 force-directed algorithms in terms of number of edge crossing and the
standard deviations of edge length. Our experimental results showed that KK,
FA2 and DH algorithms cannot produce satisfactory visualizations for large
graphs within the time limit. KK-MS-DS algorithm can process large and planar
graphs but it does not perform well for graphs with low average degrees. KK-MS
algorithm produces better visualizations for sparse and non-clustered graphs
than KK-MS-DS algorithm.

calculation as a black box and backpropagate gradients only onto the simplices
involved in particular pairs. We show how the cycles and chains used in the
persistence calculation can be used to prescribe gradients to larger subsets of
the domain. In particular, we show that in a special case, which serves as a
building block for general losses, the problem can be solved exactly in linear
time. This relies on another contribution of this paper, which eliminates the
need to examine a factorial number of permutations of simplices with the same
value. We present empirical experiments that show the practical benefits of our
algorithm: the number of steps required for the optimization is reduced by an
order of magnitude.

the player is notified of the positions in which their guess matches the secret

proving NP-hardness of its natural formalization: to decide given a dictionary
$D$ and an integer $\ell$ if the player can guarantee to discover the secret
word within $\ell$ guesses. Moreover, we prove that hardness holds even over
instances where words have length $k = 5$, and that even in this case it is
NP-hard to approximate the minimum number of guesses required to guarantee
discovering the secret word (beyond a certain constant). We also present
results regarding its parameterized complexity and offer some related open

Mr. Apollinax might have made a good escort for Lofa Polir, had she lived a hundred years ago. The titular character of a <a href="https://interestingliterature.com/2017/09/a-short-analysis-of-t-s-eliots-mr-apollinax/">poem</a> written circa 1915 by Thomas Eliot was based on Bertrand Russell, whose 1901 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_paradox">paradox</a> revealed a gaping inconsistency in set theory as it was then known. Russell spent much of the intervening years trying to repair the gap via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory#History">type theory</a>.</p>
<p>
Today we present a recently-discovered inconsistency in the type theory of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)">Scala</a> programming language, which forced a feature-chopping <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/dropped-features/type-projection.html">revision</a> in its new version <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2021/05/14/scala3-is-here.html">3.0</a>. Then, in a worldwide exclusive, we reveal a new theorem by Polir that explains why such inconsistencies are <em>inevitable</em>.</p>
<p>
Ernst Zermelo had already noticed the paradox in 1899 but brushed it off because his axiom system already evaded it. It is possible that Georg Cantor knew it in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BtZM33PzV9UC&amp;pg=PA923&amp;lpg=PA923&amp;dq=Cantor+letter+to+Dedekind+and+Hilbert+about+inconsistency&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hE28iI4IT4&amp;sig=ACfU3U2CMPDUFBheRaXGQcIMFngE-Iytdg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj1j-7ej_T2AhXJY98KHd7WDuUQ6AF6BAgOEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Cantor letter to Dedekind and Hilbert about inconsistency&amp;f=false">letters</a> in 1897 to Richard Dedekind and David Hilbert. I could call this a continuation of a theme we’ve often addressed about discoveries not being named for their first discoverers, but I will not, for this reason: The discover<b>ee</b> was Gottlob Frege, who immediately recognized that the treatise on set theory he was about to publish had been devastated by the paradox. And the person he heard that from, in June 1902, was Russell—not any of his own compatriots.</p>
<p>
The poem comes with an epigram from a Greek text by Lucian satirically praising the painter Zeuxis of Herakleia: “Ω τῆς καινότητος. Ἡράκλεις, τῆς παραδοξολογίας. εὐμήχανος ἄνθρωπος.”  The reference <a href="https://genius.com/annotations/3603099/standalone_embed">translation</a> Eliot had to hand goes: “Such novelty! Heavens, what paradoxes! How inventive he is!”  I believe, however, that Eliot intended a more-particulate reading: “Oh for his innovation! Hercules, his paradoxology! Sweet machine man!”  That goes better with the poem <a href="https://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/content/mr-apollinax">text</a> and with aspects of Russell that were visible to Eliot at the time.  We’ll only talk about the <i>paradoxology</i>.  Russell was well aware that other monsters besides his own were lurking, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene-Rosser_paradox">ones</a> that emerged in the US.  What if patching paradoxes is just the way of progress?  Let’s see this play out in the Scala programming language.</p>
<p></p><h2> The Inconsistency </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The root of the inconsistency is allowing <em>projection</em> of an <em>abstract</em> type. Let’s explain the former concept with concrete types first. A standard way to represent trees and other graphs is by having a nested node class, for instance:</p>
<p><code><br />
class BinaryTree[A &lt;: Comparable[A]] {</code></p>
<p>   class Node(var left: Node, var item: A, var right: Node)</p>
<p>   private var root: Node = null<br />
   //etc.<br />
}<br />
</p>
<p>
A key wrinkle of Scala is that if you have two different trees <font size="+1"><tt>T1</tt></font> and <font size="+1"><tt>T2</tt></font>, then <font size="+1"><tt>T1.Node</tt></font> and <font size="+1"><tt>T2.Node</tt></font> are separate types. This notion of <em>path-dependent types</em> enables the compiler to catch bugs where you might try to connect a node on one tree as a child of a node in the other tree. If there were just one <font size="+1"><tt>BinaryTree.Node</tt></font> type, as is standard in Java for instance, then you could easily make this kind of bug and the compiler would not bat an eye.</p>
<p>
If you really do want to combine nodes from two different trees, however, you can do so via code using the projection type <font size="+1"><tt>BinaryTree#Node</tt></font>. The hash sign # makes this defined to be the <i>supertype</i> of nodes of all possible binary trees. </p>
<p>
The <font size="+1"><tt>[A &lt;: Comparable[A]]</tt></font> part means that the tree can hold any type <font size="+1"><tt>A</tt></font> of data that extends a <font size="+1"><tt>trait</tt></font> called <font size="+1"><tt>Comparable</tt></font>, whose function is to mandate having a comparison function for <font size="+1"><tt>A</tt></font> so that the tree can be kept sorted. The symbol <font size="+1"><tt>&gt;:</tt></font> written the other way means supertype rather than subtype.</p>
<p>
We could try to make our binary tree class more versatile by making it more abstract. By itself it could be a <font size="+1"><tt>trait</tt></font> so as to allow deferred implementations. It could try to define a more general notion of <font size="+1"><tt>Node</tt></font> that might relate more directly to stored data, for instance strings or numbers. This is not to say such abstractions are necessarily well-motivated, but the point is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Scala compiler defines what is workable. <p></p>
</li><li>
Its notion of workability is based on mathematical type theory. <p></p>
</li><li>
Lots of abstract constructions are made workable to encourage creativity.
</li></ul>
<p>
Workability is not supposed to lead to type errors, however. That is the unsoundness allowed in versions 2.x of Scala.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Code </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
If you have a lot of time—time to read the longest <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2013/11/15/the-graph-of-math/">post</a> ever on this blog—then you can draw some motivation for the unsound code. That post shows how to represent the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann-Bernays-Godel_set_theory">NBG</a> version of set theory, due to John von Neuman, Paul Bernays, and Kurt Gödel, as an infinite graph. At the top of the graph are nodes representing the class of all sets and various other expansive types, which are symbolized by <font size="+1"><tt>V</tt></font> in the post. At the bottom is a node for the null set identified with <font size="+1"><tt>O</tt></font>. We can think of them as representing “zones” for possible supertypes and subtypes of some types of interest, such as string and number. </p>
<p>
Aside from some abstract manipulation of types, the following code does nothing except compose two versions of the identity function, applied to a <font size="+1"><tt>String</tt></font>. As you are welcome to try yourself, it compiles in Scala 2.x. But before you try to run it, you can ask yourself: exactly what number would the string “Hello World!” become?</p>
<p>
<code><br />
/** File "Unsound.scala", mod by KWR from the last example in<br />
    <a href="https://lptk.github.io/programming/2019/09/13/type-projection.html" rel="nofollow">https://lptk.github.io/programming/2019/09/13/type-projection.html</a><br />
 */<br />
object Unsound extends App {</code></p>
<p>   trait VZone { type Node &gt;: String }<br />
   trait OZone { type Node &lt;: Double }</p>
<p>   def liftup[A &lt;: VZone]: String =&gt; A#Node<br />
      = (x =&gt; x)<br />
   def godown[A &lt;: OZone]: A#Node =&gt; Double<br />
      = (x =&gt; x)</p>
<p>   def hole[A &lt;: VZone with OZone]: String =&gt; Double<br />
      = (x =&gt; godown[A](liftup[A](x)))</p>
<p>   println(hole("Hello World!"))<br />
}<br />
</p>
<p>
The point remains, however, that this program is accepted as a “theorem” in the logical theory underlying the Scala 2.x type system. That theory is thereby unsound.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Lofa Polir’s Theorem </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
A point we have been at pains to make is that this kind of happening is far from rare. Systems are proven secure and then break all the time. Creating more ways to write correct programs has created new ways to have bugs, even as the frequency of old kinds of bugs is reduced. As with the Earth’s ozone hole, the situation is not worsening but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
Dr. Polir’s new theorem not only explains why but also argues that we should be neither surprised nor dismayed by this state of affairs. It can be given the following intuitive statement:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> There is a sound theory <b>A.F.</b> that can be represented as a complexity-bounded limit of inconsistent theories, but not as an effective limit of consistent theories. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The soundness is with respect to the standard model of arithmetic and includes every statement of arithmetic proved in set theory. The clever new idea in her proof is the manner of the proof itself: it formalizes and self-applies a criterion of <em>feasible correctness in the limit</em> for a sequence of incorrect proofs. </p>
<p>
The upshot is the following:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The most productive and feasible way to do mathematics is to design inconsistent theories and fix them incrementally, rather than to demand global correctness from the get-go. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Before Dr. Polir types up her paper, she has a request for readers of this blog: What should the initials <b>A.F.</b> of her theory stand for? The name “Arithmetical Foundations” is both hackneyed and taken. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What do you think Lofa’s <b>A.F.</b> stands for? </p>

<i>If a machine is expected to be infallible, it cannot also be intelligent.—Alan Turing</i></p>
<p>
Jack Dongarra has just won the 2021 <a href="https://amturing.acm.org">Turing Award</a>. Congrats to him. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/31/the-2021-turing-award/jd/" rel="attachment wp-att-19835"><img width="300" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/jd.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19835" height="168" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
Dongarra is a Distinguished Professor of Computer Science in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at the University of Tennessee. He has connections to the nearby Oak Ridge National Laboratory, to Rice University, and in England to the University of Manchester—Turing’s academic home.  The nub of ACM’s <a href="https://awards.acm.org/about/2021-turing">article</a> says the following, with <i>linear algebra</i> emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Dongarra’s major contribution was in creating open-source software libraries and standards which employ linear algebra as an intermediate language that can be used by a wide variety of applications. These libraries have been written for single processors, parallel computers, multicore nodes, and multiple GPUs per node. Dongarra’s libraries also introduced many important innovations including autotuning, mixed precision arithmetic, and batch computations.

<p>Dongarra’s doctoral advisor was Cleve Moler decades ago in 1980.  I always think we should thank our advisors—having been one myself.  But they continued on parallel tracks in the 1980s.  Moler had invented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB">MATLAB</a> in the 1970s, but with the advent of IBM PCs in the 1980s, realized their promise for bringing advanced numerical computations into wide use.  Moler and John Little and Steve Bangert co-founded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathWorks">MathWorks</a> in 1984 to market their rewrite of MATLAB in C.  Dongarra went on to co-write a host of mathematical tools: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms">BLAS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAPACK">LAPACK</a> (which succeeded his work with Moler and others on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EISPACK">EISPACK</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK">LINPACK</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatically_Tuned_Linear_Algebra_Software">ATLAS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPCG_benchmark">HPCG</a>, and much more.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Why The Turing Award? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Dongarra received the Turing for his software—code that has had significant impact in many areas of computational science from data analytics, healthcare, renewable energy, weather prediction, genomics, and economics, to name a few. His work was over four decades of writing code that can solve linear systems. Such systems occur in just about all of engineering and science. They challenge us because we constantly wish to solve bigger and more difficult systems. And we are able to solve bigger systems because computers continue to get faster—able to do more operations per second. </p>
<p>
However, the challenge was and is that while computers get faster every year, <em>how</em> they get faster remains involved. They cannot just compute faster but how they get faster continues to be complex. If a computer just got faster every year, then Dongarra would <b>not</b> have been able to win a Turing award. That how they get faster is more complex, more involved, that made his Turing award possible. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Why So Hard? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What are some of the challenges that Dongarra had to fight, and continues to fight?  We can build off the following <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111021183914/http://www.csbruce.com/~csbruce/quotes/craig-cut.html">quip</a> by the Canadian software developer Craig Bruce:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s hardware that makes a machine fast. It’s software that makes a fast machine slow.”</p></blockquote>
<p>
And in 1980 we could add: what could make an IBM PC fast?</p>
<p>
The goal of Dongarra’s software was to run fast on the current hardware systems. The challenge over the decades is simple:  As hardware systems were improved in performance they did not simply get faster. They needed to change how they worked in order to get faster.  The systems changed from single processors, to parallel computers, multicore nodes, and multiple GPUs per node. These changes made the ability to exploit the potential performance harder and harder. </p>
<p>
Let’s assume, for example, that the hardware could not go 100X faster but could execute 100 operations at the same time. Then provided we can exploit this parallelism we can make the hardware seem to be 100 times faster. But if we cannot exploit this, we are in trouble. This is the key issue that Dongarra faced. This challenge is exactly what made his work so difficult and important.</p>
<p></p><h2>The Test of Time</h2><p></p>
<p>
The solutions found by Dongarra and his co-workers were definitive enough, and the core of linear algebra in LINPACK pure enough, that it could yield a salient benchmark of hardware power.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmarks">LINPACK benchmark suite</a> won <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/22/business/technology-measuring-how-fast-computers-really-are.html">agreement</a> by the early 1990s as giving the definitive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP500">measure</a> of hardware power.  A decade ago, they began <a href="https://news.utk.edu/2013/07/10/professor-jack-dongarra-announces-supercomputer-benchmark/">updating</a> it to involve HPCG.</p>
<p>
Thus it is not enough to say that this work has stood the test of time: it <b>is</b> the test of time.  And this is carrying into the future.  A high LINPACK score in 2013 was an early <a href="https://newatlas.com/d-wave-quantum-computer-supercomputer-ranking/27476/">indicator</a> of the power achievable by D-Wave’s quantum adiabatic hardware.  An <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/value-of-quantum-computing-benchmarks">article</a> last month titled “The Race to Quantum Advantage Depends on Benchmarking” includes LINPACK as a contender.  There is recent work toward a more-tailored <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~linlin/presentations/202007_GoogleQuantum_LinLin_handout.pdf">quantum LINPACK</a> benchmark.</p>
<p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Some interesting milestones about the Turing awards are:  The first recipient of the award, in 1966, was Alan Perlis, an American computer scientist who wrote the compiler for the ALGOL computer programming language. The first woman to win the prize was Frances Allen, in 2006, for her work in compiler optimization, which contributed to the development of parallel execution in multiprocessing. The youngest recipient was Donald Knuth, who was 36 when he received the award in 1974 for his work on algorithms and computer programming. The oldest recipient was Alfred Aho, who was 79 when he received the award in 2020 for his work on algorithms and the theory of programming language implementation.  I knew all the above winners pretty well. Rich DeMillo and I wrote a paper with Perlis in <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/social.pdf">1979</a>.  </p>
<p>
Turing himself was also a pioneer in AI, of course.  He thought about how computers could reason, how they could think.  What directions will the Turing Awards take in the future—and will they reflect this side of Turing’s vision more?</p></div>

In continuation to our recent work on noncommutative
 polynomial factorization, we consider the factorization problem for
 matrices of polynomials and show the following results.
\begin{itemize}  
\item Given as input a full rank $d\times d$ matrix $M$ whose entries
  $M_{ij}$ are polynomials in the free noncommutative ring
  $\mathbb{F}_q\langle x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n \rangle$, where each $M_{ij}$ is given by a
  noncommutative arithmetic formula of size at most $s$, we give a
  randomized algorithm that runs in time polynomial in $d,s, n$ and
  $\log_2q$ that computes a factorization of $M$ as a matrix product
  $M=M_1M_2\cdots M_r$, where each $d\times d$ matrix factor $M_i$ is
  irreducible (in a well-defined sense) and the entries of each $M_i$
  are polynomials in $\mathbb{F}_q \langle x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n \rangle$ that are output
  as algebraic branching programs. We also obtain a deterministic
  algorithm for the problem that runs in $poly(d,n,s,q)$.
\item A special case is the efficient factorization of matrices whose
  entries are univariate polynomials in $\mathbb{F}[x]$. When $\mathbb{F}$ is a finite
  field the above result applies. When $\mathbb{F}$ is the field of rationals
  we obtain a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for the problem.

<p><em>This is first guest post by Deb. More to come!</em></p>

<p>In “<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2104626">The clinician and dataset shift in artificial intelligence</a>,” published in the New England Journal of Medicine, a set of physician-scientists describe how a popular sepsis-prediction system developed by the company Epic needed to be deactivated. “Changes in patients’ demographic characteristics associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic” supposedly caused spurious alerting arising from the system, rendering it of little value to clinicians. For the authors, this is a clear illustration of distribution shift, a change in training and test data that, in this case, made it difficult to distinguish between fevers and bacterial sepsis. They go into detail about what this means: distribution shift is a fundamental challenge in machine learning, and whenever we attempt to deploy machine learning in the real world without considering the way in which that real world environment can change (whether its changes in technology (e.g., software vendors), changes in population and setting (e.g., new demographics), or changes in behavior (e.g., new reimbursement incentives), then we fail to properly consider the ways in which the data can change or shift between train and test environments. If not considered, the model will inevitably fail.</p>

<p>And why not? If the underlying test data diverges from the data used in the development of the model, we should expect disappointing results. But the distribution shift problem is so common that ML researchers and practitioners have started seeing it everywhere they look. In fact, in many cases, they will inappropriately characterize any failure of deployed ML models as a distribution shift. This both muddles our understanding of what exactly distribution shift means, and limits our vocabulary for the range of failures that can show up in deployment. In this blog post, I’ll use Epic’s sepsis-detector to illustrate some of the current confusion about distribution shift, and why the notion of “external validity”, a description of generalization problems used widely in other fields, is perhaps more relevant.</p>

<p>The terminology of distribution shift is both too specific and not specific enough. A “change in distribution” could be characterized as anything from a variation in source to a re-sampling. <a href="https://rtg.cis.upenn.edu/cis700-2019/papers/dataset-shift/dataset-shift-terminology.pdf">These changes could involve changes to the input features (ie. covariate shift), changes to the labels (ie. prior probability shift) or both (ie. concept drift).</a></p>

<p>The notion of “data distributions” themselves assumes data comes from an imagined data generating function. In that world of infinitely abundant independent data points samples from a bespoke probability distribution (ie. the “independent and identically distributed” i.i.d. assumption), describing data in terms of how it’s distributed makes a lot of sense. But as Breiman describes in <a href="http://www2.math.uu.se/~thulin/mm/breiman.pdf">“Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures”</a>, that assumption doesn’t often hold for real world data. Very rarely does one actually know the data generating function, or even a reasonable proxy - real world data is disorganized, inconsistent, and unpredictable. As a result, the term “distribution” is vague enough to not address the additional specificity necessary to direct actions and interventions. When we talk about a hypothetical distribution shift, we talk about data changes but are not specific about which data changes happen and why they happen. We’re also constraining our discourse by just looking at changes in the data in the first place, when in fact, many other changes occur between development and deployment (such as changes in interactions with the model, changes in the interpretation of model results, etc.). Specifying the type of distribution shift is one solution, but more importantly, we need to understand specific distribution shifts as part of a broader phenomenon of external validity that we need to begin to articulate as a field.</p>

<p>The most significant consequence of the myopic obsession with distributions is how it constrains ML evaluations. The benchmarking paradigm that dominates ML at the moment is a by-product of its obsession with detecting shifts in data - the evaluation of models on static data test sets are tied to assumptions about failures being due to shifts in data distribution and not much else. A myopic view on distribution shift confuses the discourse on how to evaluate models for deployment. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01312-x">Several</a> <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n1872">studies</a> on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00324-0">regulatory approvals</a> of ML-based tools in healthcare already demonstrate how over-emphasis on data distribution shift failures has led ML practitioners and even regulators within the healthcare space to inappropriately prioritize the use of <em>retrospective studies</em> (ie. evaluations on static collections of past data) rather than <em>prospective studies</em> (ie. examinations of the system within its context of use). Things like multi-site assessment, median evaluation sample size, demographic subgroup performance and
“side-by-side comparison of clinicians’ performances with and without AI” are also exceedingly rare in the evaluation of ML-based healthcare tools, as they don’t fit our current narrow perception of what can go wrong when you throw an ML model into the real world. Of course distribution shift matters but the nature in which we focus on it to the exclusion of everything else is regrettable. For better regulation and evaluation methodology for machine learning deployments, we need to expand our thinking and align ourselves with the other fields attempting to understand performance gaps between the theory and practice of interventions.</p>

<p>This broader notion of validity characterizes the accuracy of the claims being made in a specific context. The related notion of reliability has to do with reproducibility and the consistency of results (think of measurement precision), but validity is concerned with some notion of truthfulness and how close claims get to the target of describing the real relationship between inputs and outputs. There are various notions of validity discussed in measurement theory, evaluation science, program evaluation and experiment design literature, but there are common core concepts. For example, internal validity is about assessing a consistent causal relationship between the inputs and outputs within the experiment and construct validity is related to the evaluation of how well experimental variables represent the real world phenomena being observed. When discussing generalization issues, we are most interested in external validity, which analyzes if  the causal relationship between inputs and outputs observed in experiments holds for inputs and outputs outside the experimental setting.</p>

<p>To understand how external validity differs from the current discourse on distribution shift, let’s go back to the sepsis monitoring example. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2781307">“External Validation of a Widely Implemented Proprietary Sepsis Prediction Model in Hospitalized Patients,”</a>, published in JAMA, describes a retrospective study on the use of the sepsis tool between December 2018 and October 2019 (notably well before the pandemic began). They examined 27,697 patients undergoing 38,455 hospitalizations and found that the Epic Sepsis Model predicted the onset of sepsis with an area under the curve of 0.63, “which is substantially worse than the performance reported by its developer”. Furthermore, the tool “did not identify 1,709 patients with sepsis (67%) despite generating alerts… for 6,971 of all 38 455 hospitalized patients (18%), thus creating a large burden of alert fatigue.” These researchers rightfully describe these issues as “external validity” issues, and go into detail examining a range of problems far beyond the data-related “shifts” described in the “Clinician and Dataset Shift” oped. They don’t pretend that this doesn’t have to do with changes in the data - of course it does. Epic’s system evaluation was on data from 3 US health systems from 2013 to 2015, and that’s certainly a different dataset than University of Michigan’s 2018-2019 patient records. But they also comment on changes to the interactions doctors had with the model and how that modified outcomes, as well as other external validity factors that had very little to do with data at all, much less “data distribution shift.” Even when discussing substantive data changes, they are specific in characterizing what it is and breaking down the differences that occurred upon deployment at their hospital.</p>

<p>As this study shows, machine learning needs some clean guidelines for evaluating external validity.
To begin scaffolding such frameworks, we can learn from the social sciences. For example, Erin Hartman, a UC Berkeley colleague in political science, and her co-author Naoki Egami <a href="https://erinhartman.com/publication/elements/">propose a taxonomy that provides an interesting start to this discussion</a>. Their interest is in assessing external validity in scenarios where a population is given a policy treatment (eg. sending out voting reminders, updating the tax code, giving out free vaccines, etc.) and the impact of this treatment as measured within the experiment and also once implemented in the real world. If we consider the treatment to be an ML model’s integration into a broader system, we can begin to articulate what external validity could mean in the algorithmic context.  In my next blog post, I’ll try to work through Hartman and Egami’s framework and other specific proposals from other fields on how we could begin to taxonomize external validity issues, and see which of the external validity problems they describe are actually quite relevant to machine learning.</p></div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: Reproducibility is vital to ensuring scientific conclusions are reliable, but failures of reproducibility have been a major issue in nearly all scientific areas of study in recent decades. A key issue underlying the reproducibility crisis is the explosion of methods for data generation, screening, testing, and analysis, where, crucially, only the combinations producing the most significant results are reported. Such practices (also known as p-hacking, data dredging, and researcher degrees of freedom) can lead to erroneous findings that appear to be significant, but that don’t hold up when other researchers attempt to replicate them.</p>
<p>In this talk, we introduce a new notion of reproducibility for randomized algorithms. This notion ensures that with high probability, an algorithm returns exactly the same output when run with two samples from the same distribution. Despite the exceedingly strong demand of reproducibility, there are efficient reproducible algorithms for several fundamental problems in statistics and learning. We show that any statistical query algorithm can be made reproducible with a modest increase in sample complexity, and we use this to construct reproducible algorithms for finding approximate heavy-hitters and medians. Using these ideas, we give the first reproducible algorithm for learning halfspaces via a reproducible weak learner and a reproducible boosting algorithm. We initiate the study of lower bounds and inherent tradeoffs for reproducible algorithms, giving nearly tight sample complexity upper and lower bounds for reproducible versus non-reproducible SQ algorithms. Finally, we discuss connections to other well-studied notions of algorithmic stability, such as differential privacy.</p>

<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>by <a href="https://meyn.ece.ufl.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sean Meyn</a> (University of Florida) and <a href="http://cs.bme.hu/~gergo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gergely Neu</a> (Pompeu Fabra University)</p>



<p>One theoretical foundation of reinforcement learning is optimal control, usually rooted in the Markovian variety known as Markov decision processes (MDPs). The MDP model consists of a state process, an action (or input) process, and a one-step reward that is a function of state and action. The goal is to obtain a policy (function from states to actions) that is optimal in some predefined sense. Chris Watkins introduced the Q-function in the 1980s as part of a methodology for reinforcement learning. Given its importance for over three decades, it is not surprising that the question of the true meaning of <em>Q</em> was a hot topic for discussion during the Simons Institute’s Fall 2020 program on <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/rl20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Theory of Reinforcement Learning</a>.</p>



<p>This short note focuses on interactions at the start of the program, and research directions inspired in part by these interactions. To start with, <em>who is Q</em>? Was this code for one of Watkins’ friends at Cambridge? The question was posed early on, which led to an online investigation. The mystery was shattered through a response from Chris: we now know that the letter <em>Q</em> stands for <em>quality</em>, not Quinlyn or Quincy. To discuss further questions and potential answers requires some technicalities.</p>



<p>The discounted-cost optimality criterion is a favorite metric for performance in computer science and operations research, and is the setting of the original Q-function formulation. The definition requires a state process <span class="math inline">\(\{X_k : k\ge 0\}\)</span> and an action (or input) process <span class="math inline">\(\{A_k : k\ge 0\}\)</span>, evolving on respective spaces (which are assumed discrete in this note). There is a controlled transition matrix <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> that describes dynamics: <span class="math inline">\(X_{k+1}\)</span> is distributed according to <span class="math inline">\(P(\cdot|x,a)\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(X_k=x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_k=a\)</span>, for any action sequence that is adapted to the state sequence.</p>



<p>With <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> denoting the discount factor, the Q-function is the solution to a nonlinear fixed-point equation <span class="math inline">\(T^*Q = Q\)</span> in which <span class="math inline">\(T^*\)</span> is the Bellman operator: <span class="math display">\[\left(T^*Q\right)(x,a) = r(x,a) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{X’\sim P(\cdot|x,a)}\left[\max_{a’} Q(X’,a’)\right]\]</span> This must hold for each state-action pair <span class="math inline">\((x,a)\)</span>, with the maximum over all possible actions. This is a version of the dynamic programming (DP) equation that has been with us for about seven decades.</p>



<p>The magic of Q-learning, which is based on this DP equation, is that the maximum appears within an expectation. This makes possible the application of Monte Carlo methods to obtain an approximate solution based solely on observations of the actual system to be controlled, or through simulations.</p>



<p>One core idea of modern reinforcement learning (RL) is to find approximate solutions of the DP equation within a function class (e.g., neural networks, as popularized by the deep Q-learning approach of Mnih et al., 2015). While success stories are well-known, useful theory is scarce: we don’t know if a solution exists to an approximate DP equation except in very special settings, and we don’t know if a good approximation will lead to good performance for the resulting policy. We don’t even know if the recursive algorithms that define Q-learning will be stable — estimates may diverge to infinity.</p>



<p>There are many ways to read these negative results, and indeed many articles have been written around this subject. Our own reading is probably among the most radical: without understanding the issues around the existence of solutions to these DP equation approximations or their interpretation, we should search for alternative approximations of dynamic programming suitable for application in RL.</p>



<p>These concerns were raised at Sean Meyn’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUaFu3WzW7o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boot camp lecture</a>, where he called on listeners to revisit an alternate foundation of optimal control: the linear programming (LP) approach introduced by Manne (1960) and further developed by Denardo (1970) and d’Epenoux (1963). The message was greeted with enthusiasm from some attendees, including Gergely Neu, who responded, “You have blown my mind!” He had been working on his own formulation of this idea, which became logistic Q-learning (more on this below).</p>



<span id="more-636"></span>



<p>The least-squares approach that is central to most traditional RL algorithms (such as DQN) is replaced by an LP, so that we move from <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(L_\infty\)</span> approximation. There is ample motivation for this point of view:</p>



<ul><li>
		<p>Lyapunov theory and the theory of inverse dynamic programming provide firm motivation: a good approximation of the DP equation in an <span class="math inline">\(L_\infty\)</span> sense implies strict bounds on closed-loop performance of the resulting policy. You can learn more about this theory in standard RL texts, and Meyn’s new RL monograph to appear this year.</p>
	</li><li>
		<p>The LP approach reframes the DP approximation as a numerical optimization problem rather than a root-finding problem. Existence of a solution is guaranteed under minimal assumptions, even when working with a restricted set of candidate solutions.</p>
	</li></ul>



<p>Despite these advantages, LP-based approaches were left out of the mainstream RL tool kit until recently. One reason may be a glaring gap in the framework: the classical LPs are phrased in terms of state-value functions and not Q-functions! This means it was not obvious how to bring in Monte Carlo methods for algorithm design.</p>



<p>In 2020, we independently discovered the following LP that can be used to cast Q-learning as a constrained optimization problem — the so-called DPLP: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned} \mbox{minimize } \qquad &amp; \mathbb{E}_{X\sim\nu_0}\left[\max_{a} Q(X,a)\right] \\ \mbox{subject to } \qquad &amp; Q(x,a) \ge r(x,a) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{X’\sim P(\cdot|x,a)}\left[\max_{a’} Q(X’,a’)\right]\end{aligned}\]</span> Without any constraints on the function class, the optimizer is the solution to the DP equation. The constraints amount to the DP inequality <span class="math inline">\(Q \ge T^* Q\)</span>, which tells us only <em>negative</em> deviations should be penalized! This is to be contrasted with the commonly used squared Bellman error criterion that penalizes deviations of both signs. In seeking an approximation within a function class <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>, it is not at all difficult to ensure a feasible solution exists, even when there is no theory to ensure that an approximate Bellman optimality operator has a fixed point.</p>



<p>There are a variety of possible ways of turning <span> this</span> insight into practical algorithms. One path (taken by Bas-Serrano et al., 2021) is to replace the hard constraint in the LP with a smooth upper bound on the expected constraint violations, resulting in the following unconstrained minimization problem: <span class="math display">\[%  \mbox{minimize } \mathbb{E}_{X\sim\nu_0}[\max_a Q(X,a)] + \frac 1\eta \log 
% \mathbb{E}_{(X,A)\sim\mu}[e^{\eta(r(X,A) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{X’\sim P(\cdot|X,A)}[\max_{a’} Q(X’,a’)] – Q(X,A))}].
\mbox{minimize} \;\;\;\;\;\;\,\, \mathbb{E}_{X\sim\nu_0}\left[\max_a Q(X,a)\right] + \frac 1\eta \log 
\mathbb{E}_{(X,A)\sim\mu}\left[e^{\eta((T^*Q)(X,A) – Q(X,A))}\right].\]</span> Bas-Serrano et al. (2021) dubbed the above objective function the “logistic Bellman error” and have shown that it enjoys several favorable properties that make it an ideal objective for stochastic optimization. Interactions at the Simons Institute led to the development of another related algorithmic framework called “convex Q-learning,” in which the hard constraints in the LP are replaced with a different continuous approximation (Lu et al., 2021).</p>



<p>It is straightforward to derive practical algorithms from both approaches by replacing the expectations with sample averages. This approach led to good empirical performance, along with the beginnings of theory for convergence and performance bounds.</p>



<p>The LP approach had been simmering in the background over the prior decade: de Farias and Van Roy (2003) proposed an LP approach for approximate dynamic programming, and Mehta and Meyn (2009) contains foundations for convex Q-learning, including a variant of the DPLP for deterministic systems in continuous time.</p>



<p>The new techniques bring challenges that must be overcome before these LP-based approaches can take on the world. One is that these optimization problems can be very poorly conditioned. Another is that the approximation may greatly underestimate the true Q-function when using a poor choice of function class for approximation. We remain optimistic: just like the RL community has successfully developed numerical recipes for addressing the much more severe issue of nonexistence of fixed points to the approximate Bellman operators, we believe that similar know-how can be developed for LP-based methods if theorists and practitioners join forces. Now that we understand where Q comes from, let us decide together where it will go next!</p>



<p><em>Acknowledgment</em>. The authors owe a great debt to the Simons Institute for providing inspiration and interactions throughout the fall program. In particular, our joint work (Lu et al., 2021) was in large part an outcome of discussions at the meeting. The LP approach is one theme of the new textbook (Meyn, 2022), and the impact of the program is seen throughout the book.</p>

Keith Kirkpatrick is the author of an interesting CACM <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2022/4/259392-still-waiting-for-self-driving-cars/fulltext">article</a> on self-driving cars. It is titled “Still Waiting For Self-Driving Cars” and appears in the news section of this month’s issue. </p>
<p>
Today we discuss why it has been so difficult to get self-driving cars started.</p>
<p>
Kirkpatrick’s article starts:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Over the past decade, technology and automotive pundits have predicted the “imminent” arrival of fully autonomous vehicles that can drive on public roads without any active monitoring or input from a human driver. Elon Musk has predicted his company Tesla would deliver fully autonomous vehicles by the end of 2021, but he made similar predictions in 2020, 2019, and 2017. Each prediction has fallen flat, largely due to real-world safety concerns, particularly related to how self-driving cars perform in adverse conditions or situations.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> An Issue </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
As printed in the current CACM issue, his article says the following on page 13:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A potential intermediate solution currently being tested in Germany is to utilize remote drivers to control vehicles. Vay, a Berlin-based startup, has been testing a fleet of remote-controlled electric vehicles in that city and plans to roll out a mobility service in Europe and potentially the U.S. this year. The service will allow customers to order a remote-controlled car and have it drive them to their desired destination; on arrival, they get out if the vehicle and leave it to a human teledriver miles away to either park the vehicle or steer it to the next client. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
I claim this shows the issue that we have with automatic driving systems. There is a typo in the above paragraph. A typo that shows what we are up against in the attempt to make automatic driving systems. </p>
<p>
<b>DO YOU SEE IT?</b></p>
<p></p><p><br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/26/waiting-for-self-deriving-cars/cacmifoftypo/" rel="attachment wp-att-19792"><img width="253" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CACMifoftypo.jpg?resize=253%2C36&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-19792" height="36" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
We claim that a typo like this in a CACM article is part of the reason it is so hard to make self-driving cars. Do you agree? Or is the typo not critical? While we’re at it, does the title of this post have a typo?  Read on…</p>
<p>
Ken contributes a more difficult example of this kind, one he used while addressing the same issue of AI advances in his department’s Freshman Seminar. It relates to a later section in Kirkpatrick’s article, where he discusses the issue of</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> …testing to ensure vehicle navigation systems understand the complex social interactions that often occur between oncoming and adjacent drivers, or drivers and pedestrians. Generally, if a pedestrian is about to cross or is crossing a street, the driver and pedestrian will make eye contact, and will use nonverbal cues to indicate the direction and speed of their movement. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Over to Ken:</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Ken’s Example </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Here is the relevant portion of the White House <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/07/13/remarks-president-campaign-event-roanoke-virginia">transcript</a> of Barack Obama’s July 2012 campaign speech in Roanoke, Virginia—the one with the notorious phrase “you didn’t build that”:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/26/waiting-for-self-deriving-cars/youdidntbuildthat/" rel="attachment wp-att-19798"><img width="363" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/YouDidntBuildThat.jpg?resize=363%2C229&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-19798" height="229" /></a></p>
<p>
The question we could submit to Google—whose own automated-driving efforts have had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/technology/personaltech/google-says-its-not-the-driverless-cars-fault-its-other-drivers.html">difficulties</a> with interpreting rules—is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> What does the word “that” in “you didn’t build that” refer to? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
By rules of linguistic derivation, the answer seems clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The word “that” refers to the most recent noun, which is “business.” <p></p>
</li><li>
The dashes ‘- -‘ connect two parts that refer to each other. <p></p>
</li><li>
The word cannot anyway refer to “roads and bridges” because that is plural whereas “that” is singular, like “business.” <p></p>
</li><li>
(The preceding point is not a self-contradiction because in quotes, “roads and bridges” is a phrase—singular.)
</li></ul>
<p>
Now please take a minute-plus to listen to the actual delivery of this part of the speech (you may need to click back from 0:00:08 to 0:00:00 to get the start):</p>
<p></p><center><br />
<br />
</center><p></p>
<p></p><p><br />
First, the transcript is missing a word: Obama actually said “<em>that</em>—you didn’t build <em>that</em>.” Perhaps having a rhetorically emphasized <em>that</em> right after “business” makes the semantic designation even clearer? But then notice that the part “if you’ve got a business” was delivered in a quick and parenthetical manner inside the full phrase “Somebody invested in roads and bridges … you didn’t build that.” </p>
<p>
The interpretation that the “that” refers to <em>infrastructure</em> is supported by the speech’s immediate segue to the Internet, sandwiched around “somebody else made that happen.” Going out to sources, Obama was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/an-unoriginal-obama-quote-taken-out-of-context/2012/07/20/gJQAdG7hyW_blog.html">channeling</a> a point already notoriously made by Elizabeth Warren in a 2011 <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/the-agenda/elizabeth-warrens-quote-reihan-salam/">speech</a>. But without going out to sources—something we cannot expect an AI to do in the moment—there is Obama’s next sentence (also included in the speech clip):</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Whether Obama intended to say that people did not build their businesses can still be argued, but that’s not the real point. My first point is that AIs based on current art for ascribing meanings not only would make that ascription, but <em>should</em> do so for overall consistency. And the second, larger, point at the end of my <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/cse199/InternetAndData199np.pdf">slides</a>, where I get to hard AI problems, is this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We base our confidence in developing AI systems on Alan Turing’s principle that whatever the human mind can resolve, a computer can be programmed to apprehend and execute. But what if important data, on fine scales, concern matters that our human minds cannot resolve? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
CACM puts in a bubble Kirkpatrick’s quoting another expert that “it will take years and massive compute power to train self-driving systems to understand the nonverbal cues that pass between drivers and pedestrians.”  We believe the task and need of getting cars to <em>self-derive</em> meanings is greater still.  </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Do these issues say anything about the difficulty of getting code right? We think so, but what do you think?</p>
<p></p><p><br />

<p><strong>The 2022 STOC Test of Time Award</strong> recognizes papers published in the Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing. This is the second year of this annual award. There are three awards, targeting the STOC conferences 10, 20, and 30 years prior to the year in which the award is given. While there is a preference for papers in the target years (and nominations from those years are encouraged), in each of these award categories it is also possible to nominate STOC conference papers published up to four conferences earlier than the targeted conference. Thus, the 2022 STOC Test of Time Awards will be for papers presented at the STOC conferences in 2008-2012, 1998-2002, and 1988-1992. The awards, which will be presented at STOC 2022, include a prize of US $500 per author as well as complimentary registration for all authors who attend the conference at which the award is given.</p>



<h2>Nomination Procedure</h2>



<p>Nominations should be sent to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>stoc22.tot.award@gmail.com</strong></a><strong> </strong>with a subject line of <strong>“STOC Test of Time Award” </strong>no later than <strong>April 30, 2022</strong>. Nominations should contain an explanation of the impact of the nominated paper(s), including references to follow-on work. A nomination may be accompanied by up to three additional endorsement letters, which may be sent by the endorsers directly to the same email address with the same subject line. Self-nominations are disallowed. </p>



<h2>Selection</h2>



<p>The winners will be selected by a committee appointed by the SIGACT Executive Committee. For 2022 the selection committee consists of Toniann Pitassi (Columbia), Satish Rao (Berkeley), Salil Vadhan (Harvard, chair), Avi Wigderson (Institute for Advanced Study). </p>



<p>In selecting the Test of Time Award winners, the Committee will pay particular attention to long-term impact. This impact can come in many forms, including but not limited to:</p>



<ol><li>Opening up a new area of research</li><li>Introducing new techniques</li><li>Solving a problem of lasting importance</li><li>Stimulating advances in other areas of computer science or in other disciplines.</li></ol>



<p>The committee expects to select exactly one paper for each award. However, when circumstances justify it, up to three may be selected. The committee may consider papers that were not explicitly nominated and gather additional input from experts, but formal nominations are extremely helpful in the committee’s deliberations and strongly encouraged.</p></div>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:  In the Pandora’s Box problem, the algorithm is provided with a number of boxes with unknown (stochastic) rewards contained inside them. The algorithm can open any box at some cost, discover the reward inside, and based on these observations can choose one box and keep the reward contained in it. Given the distributions from which the rewards are drawn, the algorithm must determine an order in which to open the boxes as well as when to stop and accept the best reward found so far. In general, an optimal algorithm may make both decisions adaptively based on instantiations observed previously. The Pandora’s Box problem and its extensions capture many kinds of optimization problems with stochastic input where the algorithm can obtain instantiations of input random variables at some cost. Previous work on these problems assumes that different random variables in the input are distributed independently. As such it does not capture many real-world settings. In this work, we provide the first algorithms for Pandora’s Box-type problems with correlations. In the independent setting, optimal algorithms are non-adaptive and based on the notion of the Gittins index. These techniques fail to extend to the correlated case. We assume that the algorithm has access to samples drawn from the joint distribution on input and provide solutions that require few samples; are computationally efficient; and guarantee approximate optimality. <br />This is joint work with Evangelia Gergatsouli, Yifeng Teng, Christos Tzamos, and Ruimin Zhang and appeared in FOCS’20.</p>

The sum of the absolute values of the Fourier coefficients of a function $f:\mathbb{F}_2^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is called the spectral norm of $f$.    Green and Sanders' quantitative version of  Cohen's idempotent theorem states that if the spectral norm of $f:\mathbb{F}_2^n \to \{0,1\}$ is at most $M$, then the support of $f$ belongs to the ring of sets generated by at most $\ell(M)$ cosets,  where $\ell(M)$ is a constant that only depends on $M$.
    
    We prove that the above statement can be generalized to approximate spectral norms if and only if the support of $f$ and its complement satisfy a certain arithmetic connectivity condition. In particular, our theorem provides a new proof of the quantitative Cohen's theorem for $\mathbb{F}_2^n$.</div>

Quantified conflict-driven clause learning (QCDCL) is one of the main solving approaches for quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). One of the differences between QCDCL and propositional CDCL is that QCDCL typically follows the prefix order of the QBF for making decisions.
We investigate an alternative model for QCDCL solving where decisions can be made in arbitrary order. The resulting system QCDCL-ANY is still sound and terminating, but does not necessarily allow to always learn asserting clauses or cubes. To address this potential drawback, we additionally introduce two subsystems that guarantee to always learn asserting clauses (QCDCL-UNI-ANY) and asserting cubes (QCDCL-EXI-ANY), respectively.
We model all four approaches by formal proof systems and show that QCDCL-UNI-ANY is exponentially better than QCDCL on false formulas, whereas QCDCL-EXI-ANY is exponentially better than QCDCL on true QBFs. Technically, this involves constructing specific QBF families and showing lower and upper bounds in the respective proof systems.
We complement our theoretical study with some initial experiments that confirm our theoretical findings.</div>

<p>A few days ago I received by mail Imre Bárány’s new book <em>Combinatorial Convexity</em>. The book presents Helly-type theorems and other results in convexity with combinatorial flavour. The choice of material and the choice of proofs is terrific and it is an ideal book for a course for graduate students and advanced undergraduates.  Congratulations, Imre!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/ulect-77/">AMS page</a> gives the following description</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>This book is about the combinatorial properties of convex sets, families of convex sets in finite dimensional Euclidean spaces, and finite points sets related to convexity. This area is classic, with theorems of Helly, Carathéodory, and Radon that go back more than a hundred years. At the same time, it is a modern and active field of research with recent results like Tverberg’s theorem, the colourful versions of Helly and Carathéodory, and the <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-1"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-2"><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-3">(</span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-4">p</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-5">,</span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-6">q</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-7">)</span></span></span></span> theorem of Alon and Kleitman. As the title indicates, the topic is convexity and geometry, and is close to discrete mathematics. The questions considered are frequently of a combinatorial nature, and the proofs use ideas from geometry and are often combined with graph and hypergraph theory. </em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>The book is intended for students (graduate and undergraduate alike), but postdocs and research mathematicians will also find it useful. It can be used as a textbook with short chapters, each suitable for a one- or two-hour lecture. Not much background is needed: basic linear algebra and elements of (hyper)graph theory as well as some mathematical maturity should suffice.</em></span></p></blockquote>

<p>I ran the SIGACT Book Review Column from 1997-2015 (18 years). You can find all of my columns, plus reviews I did for Fred, <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/bookrev/bookrev.html">here</a>.</p><p>When I handed it off to Fred Green I gave him this sage advice:</p><p>                   <i>Nobody should do this kind of job for more than about 5 years.</i></p><p>He ran the SIGACT Book Review Column since the end of 2015. You can find some of his columns <a href="http://mathcs.clarku.edu/~fgreen/SIGACTReviews/bookrev/bookrev.html">here</a>.</p><p>Fred is taking my advice and looking for a successor.</p><p>SO, this blog is a call to ask</p><p>                 DO YOU WANT TO BE THE SIGACT NEWS BOOK REVIEW EDITOR?</p><p>If so then email</p><p>Fred: fgreen@clarku.edu</p><p><br /></p><p>DO NOT BE SHY! I suspect he won't get many applicants, so if you want the job its probably yours.</p><p><br /></p><p>PROS</p><p>1) You get to skim lots of books and read some of  them.</p><p>2) You get some free books.</p><p>3) You get plugged into the book community (this helped me when I wrote my two books).</p><p>4) You'll have two Veteran Book Review Editors happy to review for you.</p><p>5) You get to decide the direction the column goes in.</p><p>Both Fred and I did mostly CS theory books. However:</p><p>a) I did more combinatorics, educational, history, and Computers &amp; Society books than usual.</p><p>b) Fred did more Number Theory and Physics than usual.</p><p>(Since I did the job 18 years and Fred for 6, its not clear what <i>usual</i> means.) </p><p><br /></p><p>CONS</p><p>1) You have to get out a book review column 4 times a year.</p><p>2) You have to find reviewers for books and then email them when the reviews are due.</p><p>(I think Fred is still waiting for me to review a Biography of Napier. Oh well. On the other hand, I was the one who liked having history books, which may explain why Fred never hassled me about it.) </p><p><br /></p><p>ADVICE</p><p>Prob should be done by someone who already has Tenure. While seeing and skimming thosebooks is GOOD for your research career, and good in the long-termsomeone pre-tenure really needs to get papers out in the short term. Also, when you get a book think about who might be good to review it--- don't take on to many yourself. </p><p><br /></p><p>PARTING GIFT OR WELCOME GIFT</p><p>In a recent column I had a review of a 5-book set from the LESS WRONG blog.

<p>This fall, I taught my course <a href="https://cs127.boazbarak.org/">CS 127: Cryptography</a>, based on my lecture notes: <a href="https://intensecrypto.org/">“An intensive introduction to cryptography”</a>. This is a course that starts with no background knowledge, and gets to advanced concepts including lattice-based (aka “post quantum”) encryption, fully homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, multiparty secure computation, software obfuscation, quantum computing and crypto, and more. </p>



<p><a href="https://cs127.boazbarak.org/projects/">As in previous years</a>, I had an fantastic group of students, several of whom produced impressive course projects. These include the following: </p>



<p><strong>Gavin Uberti</strong>, <strong>Kevin Luo</strong>, <strong>Oliver Cheng,</strong>  and <strong>Wittmann Goh</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04581">implemented Witness Encryption</a>. Witness encryption is a cool concept whereby you can encrypt a secret X (for example the private key corresponding to a bitcoin wallet) so that people can decrypt X if and only if they can find a solution to some puzzle P. You can do this <em>even if you don’t know a solution yourself!</em> So for example you could use this to offer an automatically paying reward for a formal proof of the Reimann Hypothesis, or as they did, offer 2270  Satoshis to anyone solving this Soduko puzzle:</p>

<p><strong>Simas Sakenis</strong> wrote a <a href="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/simas_project.pdf">survey of proofs of stake in cryptocurrencies</a>,  providing a uniform formalizaiton of proofs of work and proofs of stake, and explaining the difference. </p>



<p><strong>Michael Kiestra</strong> and <strong>Beatrice Nash</strong> proposed  <a href="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/kiestra_nash.pdf">CLAMBAKE</a>,  a protocol that uses broadcast encryption and Yao’s garbled circuits to achieve a privacy-preserving protocol for facilitating access to controlled resources such as university buildings.</p>



<p>(There were more projects in the course, but some students preferred not to post these publicly since they are still working on them; I will update this post with more projects if appropriate.)</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: Pessiland is the worst of Impagliazzo’s five possible worlds: it is a world where NP is hard on average and pseudorandom generators do not exist. Excluding Pessiland (i.e., showing the equivalence between average-case hardness of NP and the existence of pseudorandom generators) is one of the most important open questions in theoretical computer science. In this talk, we propose to consider PH (Polynomial Hierarchy) variants of Impagliazzo’s five possible worlds. Our main result is to unconditionally rule out PH variants of Pessiland. I will also mention recent progress on excluding PH Heuristica: average-case hardness of PH follows from exponential worst-case hardness of PH.</p>

<p>I am on the <a href="https://focs2022.eecs.berkeley.edu/cfp.html">FOCS 2022 </a>Program Committee, and I am overjoyed that the PC meeting will be virtual.  Hopefully, the days are over when the program chair can brush aside all cost-benefit considerations, impose their backyard on far-away scholars who need service items, and then splash their offspring at the welcome party.</p>



<p>I am also overjoyed that we will be implementing double-blind reviews.  This issue has been discussed and ridiculed at length.  Admittedly, it makes it harder to adhere to Leonid Levin’s 1995 influential <em><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/202840.606487">STOC Criteria</a></em>.  For example, if a reviewer wanted to trash a paper based on the fact that the authors are not in the position to judge their own work, now they’ll have to check online for talks or preprints to know who the authors are.  Given the volume of reviews, it’s reasonable to expect that in some cases the reviewer won’t be able to conclusively exclude that a letter-writer is among the authors.  In such a situation they can resort to writing a very long, thorough, and competent review whose most significant digit is the STOC/FOCS death sentence: <em>weak accept</em>.</p>



<p>No, I actually do have something more constructive to say about this.  I was — as they say — privileged to serve on many NSF panels.  As an aside, it’s interesting that there the track-record of the investigators <em>is </em>a key factor in the decision; in fact, according to many including myself, it should carry even more weight, rather than forcing investigators to fill pages with made-up directions most of which won’t pan out.  But that’s another story; what is relevant for this post is that each panel begins with a quick “de-biasing” briefing, which I actually enjoy and from which I learnt something.  For example, there’s a classic experiment where the ratio of females hired as musicians increases if auditions hide the performer behind a tent and make them walk in on carpet so you can’t tell what shoes they are wearing.  Similar experiments exist that hide names from the folders of applicants, etc.  What I propose is to do a similar thing when reviewing papers.  That is, start with a de-biasing briefing: tell reviewers to ask themselves whether their attitude towards a paper would be different if:</p>



<ol><li>The authors of this paper/previous relevant work were ultra-big shots, or</li><li>The authors of this paper/previous relevant work were hapless nobodies, or</li><li>The proofs in this paper could be simplified dramatically to the point that even I understand them, or</li><li>This result came with a super-complicated proof which I can’t even begin to follow, or</li></ol>



<p>What other questions would be good to ask?</p></div>
