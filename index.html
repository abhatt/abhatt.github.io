For every prime p &gt; 0, every n &gt; 0 and ? = O(logn), we show the existence
of an unsatisfiable system of polynomial equations over O(n log n) variables of degree O(log n) such that any Polynomial Calculus refutation over F_p with M extension variables, each depending on at most ? original variables requires size exp(?????(n2/(?^2*2^?*(M + ????nlog(n))))) .</div>

a parameter $0 &lt; \delta \leq 1$ and a finite collection $\mathcal{F}$ of
irreducible and pairwise independent polynomials of degree at most 2, we say
that $\mathcal{F}$ is a $(\delta, 2)$-radical Sylvester-Gallai configuration if

surface, one that is obtained by gluing Euclidean polygons, has an isometric
piecewise linear (PL) embedding into Euclidean space $\mathbb{E}^3$. A flat
torus, resulting from the identification of the opposite sides of a Euclidean
parallelogram, is a simple example of polyhedral surface. In a first part, we
adapt the proof of Burago and Zalgaller, which is partially constructive, to
produce PL isometric embeddings of flat tori. In practice, the resulting
embeddings have a huge number of vertices, moreover distinct for every flat
torus. In a second part, based on another construction of Zalgaller and on
recent works by Arnoux et al., we exhibit a universal triangulation with 5974
triangles which can be embedded linearly on each triangle in order to realize
the metric of any flat torus.

Well-known advanced
composition theorems allow one to query a private database quadratically more
times than basic privacy composition would permit. However, these results
require that the privacy parameters of all algorithms be fixed before
interacting with the data. To address this, Rogers et al. introduced fully
adaptive composition, wherein both algorithms and their privacy parameters can
be selected adaptively. The authors introduce two probabilistic objects to
measure privacy in adaptive composition: privacy filters, which provide
differential privacy guarantees for composed interactions, and privacy
odometers, time-uniform bounds on privacy loss. There are substantial gaps
between advanced composition and existing filters and odometers. First,
existing filters place stronger assumptions on the algorithms being composed.
Second, these odometers and filters suffer from large constants, making them
impractical. We construct filters that match the tightness of advanced
composition, including constants, despite allowing for adaptively chosen
privacy parameters. We also construct several general families of odometers.
These odometers can match the tightness of advanced composition at an
arbitrary, preselected point in time, or at all points in time simultaneously,
up to a doubly-logarithmic factor. We obtain our results by leveraging recent
advances in time-uniform martingale concentration. In sum, we show that fully
adaptive privacy is obtainable at almost no loss, and conjecture that our
results are essentially unimprovable (even in constants) in general.

partially solving the ILP model. We performed tests comparing the three

distinct sets of Eulerian graphs, each set grouping graphs with different

efficient allocation rules for restless multiarmed bandits. In this paper, we
develop an algorithm to test the indexability and compute the Whittle indices
of any finite-state Markovian bandit problem. This algorithm works in the
discounted and non-discounted cases. As a byproduct, it can also be used to
compute Gittins index. Our algorithm builds on three tools: (1) a careful
characterization of Whittle index that allows one to compute recursively the th
smallest index from the (-- 1)th smallest, and to test indexability, (2) the
use of Sherman-Morrison formula to make this recursive computation efficient,
and (3) a sporadic use of fast matrix inversion and multiplication to obtain a
subcubic complexity. We show that an efficient use of the Sherman-Morrison
formula leads to an algorithm that computes Whittle index in (2$\Uparrow$3) 3 +
(3) arithmetic operations, where is the number of states of the arm. The
careful use of fast matrix multiplication leads to the first subcubic algorithm
to compute Whittle (or Gittins) index. By using the current fastest matrix
multiplications, our algorithm runs in (2.5286). We also conduct a series of
experiments that demonstrate that our algorithm is very efficient in practice
and can compute indices of Markov chains with several thousands of states in a
few seconds.

minimum entropy variable that has a given set of distributions $S = \{p_1,
\dots, p_m \}$ as its marginals. Although this problem is NP-Hard, previous
works have proposed algorithms with varying approximation guarantees. In this
paper, we show that the greedy coupling algorithm of [Kocaoglu et al., AAAI'17]
is always within $\log_2(e)$ ($\approx 1.44$) bits of the minimum entropy
coupling. In doing so, we show that the entropy of the greedy coupling is
upper-bounded by $H\left(\bigwedge S \right) + \log_2(e)$. This improves the
previously best known approximation guarantee of $2$ bits within the optimal
[Li, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory '21]. Moreover, we show our analysis is tight by
proving there is no algorithm whose entropy is upper-bounded by
$H\left(\bigwedge S \right) + c$ for any constant $c&lt;\log_2(e)$. Additionally,
we examine a special class of instances where the greedy coupling algorithm is
exactly optimal.

(SpMV) normally requires special care to store and tune for a given device.
However, SpMV is one of the most important kernels in high-performance
computing (HPC), and therefore, a storage format and tuning are required that
allows for efficient SpMV operations with low memory and tuning overheads
across heterogeneous devices. Additionally, the primary users of SpMV
operations in HPC are normally application scientists that already have
numerous other libraries they depend on the use of some standard sparse matrix
storage format. As such, the ideal heterogeneous format would also be something
that could easily be understood and requires no major changes to be translated
into a standard sparse matrix format, such as compressed sparse row (CSR). This
paper presents a heterogeneous format based on CSR, named CSR-k, that can be
tuned quickly, requires minimal memory overheads, outperforms the average
performance of NVIDIA's cuSPARSE on our test suite, and does not need any
conversion to be used by standard library calls that require a CSR format
input. In particular, CSR-k achieves this by grouping rows into a hierarchical
structure of super-rows and super-super-rows that are represented by just a few
extra arrays of pointers (i.e., &lt;2% memory overhead to keep arrays for both GPU
and CPU execution). Due to its simplicity, a model can be tuned for a device,
and this model can be used to select super-row and super-super-rows sizes in
constant time. We observe in this paper that CSR-k can achieve about 15%
improvement on a V100 and about 17.4% improvement on an A100 over NVIDIA's
cuSPARSE while still providing about a 13x speedup on an AMD Epyc 7713.

high-temperature and no external field, and study the problem of sampling from
the Gibbs distribution $\mu$ in polynomial time. We prove that, for any inverse
temperature $\beta&lt;1/2$, there exists an algorithm with complexity $O(n^2)$
that samples from a distribution $\mu^{alg}$ which is close in normalized
Wasserstein distance to $\mu$. Namely, there exists a coupling of $\mu$ and
$\mu^{alg}$ such that if $(x,x^{alg})\in\{-1,+1\}^n\times \{-1,+1\}^n$ is a
pair drawn from this coupling, then $n^{-1}\mathbb
E\{||x-x^{alg}||_2^2\}=o_n(1)$. The best previous results, by Bauerschmidt and
Bodineau and by Eldan, Koehler, and Zeitouni, implied efficient algorithms to
approximately sample (under a stronger metric) for $\beta&lt;1/4$.
</p>
<p>We complement this result with a negative one, by introducing a suitable
"stability" property for sampling algorithms, which is verified by many
standard techniques. We prove that no stable algorithm can approximately sample
for $\beta&gt;1$, even under the normalized Wasserstein metric.
</p>
<p>Our sampling method is based on an algorithmic implementation of stochastic
localization, which progressively tilts the measure $\mu$ towards a single
configuration, together with an approximate message passing algorithm that is
used to approximate the mean of the tilted measure.

computational complexity. Its impact has penetrated into all aspects of
algorithm design, especially in the field of cryptography. The security of
cryptographic algorithms based on short keys depends on whether P is equal to
NP. In fact, Shannon[1] strictly proved that the one-time-pad system meets
unconditional security, but because the one-time-pad system requires the length
of key to be at least the length of plaintext, how to transfer the key is a
troublesome problem that restricts the use of the one-time-pad system in
practice. Cryptography algorithms used in practice are all based on short key,
and the security of the short key mechanism is ultimately based on "one-way"
assumption, that is, it is assumed that a one-way function exists. In fact, the
existence of one-way function can directly lead to the important conclusion P
!= NP. In this paper, we originally constructed a short-key block cipher
algorithm. The core feature of this algorithm is that for any block, when a
plaintext-ciphertext pair is known, any key in the key space can satisfy the
plaintext-ciphertext pair, that is, for each block, the plaintext-ciphertext
pair and the key are independence, and the independence between blocks is also
easy to construct. This feature is completely different from all existing
short-key cipher algorithms. Based on the above feature, we construct a problem
and theoretically prove that the problem satisfies the properties of one-way
functions, thereby solving the problem of the existence of one-way functions,
that is, directly proving that P != NP.

<p>As members of the TCS community will most likely know, FOCS established<a href="https://focs2021.cs.colorado.edu/test-of-time-awards/" target="_blank"> Test-of-Time Awards from its 2021 edition</a> to celebrate contributions published at that conference 30, 20 and 10 years before. The first list of selected winners is, as one might have expected, stellar: <br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Uriel Feige, Shafi Goldwasser, László Lovász, Shmuel Safra, Mario Szegedy:<br />Approximating Clique is Almost NP-Complete.<br />FOCS 1991</li><li>David Zuckerman:<br />Simulating BPP Using a General Weak Random Source.<br />FOCS 1991</li><li>Serge A.

Awards are a scarce resource! My goal with this post is simply to remind our community (and especially its younger members) of a seminal contribution that they might want to read or re-read. <br /></p><p>The paper in question is "<a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6860/2019sp/Handouts/EmersonJutla91.pdf" target="_blank">Tree automata, mu-calculus and determinacy</a>" by <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~emerson/" target="_blank">Allen Emerson</a> and <a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-csjutla" target="_blank">Charanjit S. Jutla</a>, which appeared at FOCS 1991. (Emerson shared the 2007 A.M. Turing Award for the invention of model checking and Jutla went on to doing path-breaking work in cryptography.) That paper is absolutely fundamental for the mu-calculus, but also for automata theory, and verification in general. It introduced many ideas and results that became the basis for extensive research. </p><p>As a first contribution, the article introduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_game" target="_blank">parity games</a> and proved their fundamental properties. The parity condition was a missing link in automata theory on infinite objects. It made the whole theory much simpler than that proposed in earlier work.  Technically, the parity condition is both universal and positional. Universal means that tree automata with parity conditions are as expressive as those with Rabin or Muller conditions. Positional means that in the acceptance game if a player has a winning strategy then she has one depending only on the current position and not on the history of the play so far. This is a huge technical advance for all automata-theoretic constructions and for the analysis of  infinite-duration games. It allows one, for instance,  to avoid the complicated arguments of Gurevich and Harlington in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/800070.802177" target="_blank">their seminal STOC 1982 article</a>, which were already a huge simplification of <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1969-141-00/S0002-9947-1969-0246760-1/S0002-9947-1969-0246760-1.pdf" target="_blank">Rabin's original argument from 1969</a> proving the decidability of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadic_second-order_logic#Decidability_and_complexity_of_satisfiability" target="_blank">monadic second-order theory of the infinite binary tree</a> and much more. In passing, let me remark that Rabin has gone on record saying that "I consider this to be the most difficult research I have ever done." See <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69370-an-interview-with-michael-rabin/fulltext" target="_blank">this interview</a> in CACM. </p><p>The second main contribution of that paper is the discovery of the relation between parity games and the mu-calculus. The authors show how a mu-calculus model-checking problem can be reduced to solving a parity game, and conversely, how the set of winning positions in a parity game can be described by a mu-calculus formula. This result is the birth of the "model-checking via games" approach. It also shows that establishing a winner in parity games is contained both in NP and in co-NP. As a corollary, the model-checking problem is as complex as solving games. It is still not known if the problem is in PTIME. A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3055399.3055409" target="_blank">recent advance from STOC'17</a> gives a quasi-polynomial-time algorithm. (See <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/03/parity-games-in-quasipolynomial-time.html" target="_blank">this blog post</a> for a discussion of that result, which received the STOC 2017 best paper award and was immediately followed up by a flurry of related papers.) </p><p>Finally, the paper also shows how to prove Rabin's complementation lemma, which is the most difficult step in his celebrated aforementioned decidability result, with the help of parity conditions. The proof is radically simpler than previous approaches. The paper puts this contribution most prominently, but actually the conceptual and technical contributions presented later in the paper turned out to be most important for the community. </p><p>Overall, the above-mentioned paper by Emerson and Jutla is a truly seminal contribution that has stood the test of time, has sown the seeds for much research  over the last thirty years (as partly witnessed by the over 1,130 citations it has received so far) and is still stimulating advances at the cutting edge of theoretical computer science that bridge the Volume A-Volume B divide. </p><p>I encourage everyone to read it!</p><p><b>Acknowledgement:</b> I have learnt much of the content of this post from Igor Walukiewicz.

<p>This month has seen a flurry of activity in sublinear algorithms and a diverse collection of papers have come up, with topics ranging from differentially private sublinear algorithms to local testers for multiplicity codes. Apologies to the readers for the delay in putting this post together!</p>



<p><strong>Almost-Optimal Sublinear-Time Edit Distance in the Low Distance Regime</strong> by Karl Bringmann, Alejandro Cassis, Nick Fischer and Vasileios Nakos (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08066">arXiv</a>)</p>



<p>This paper considers the problem of gap edit distance, i.e., of determining if the edit distance between two strings \(x\) and \(y\) is at most \(k\) or at least \(K\). Their main result is an algorithm that runs in time \(O(n/k + \text{poly}(k))\) and solves the problem for \(K =  k \cdot 2^{\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log k})}\). The paper improves upon earlier results of Goldenberg, Krauthgamer and Saha (2019) and Kociumaka and Saha (2020) who solved the problem for \(K = k^2\) with the same asymptotic guarantee on the query complexity. </p>



<p>One of the interesting takeaways from the paper is that the complexity of solving the gap Hamming distance and gap edit distance are similar in the low distance regime. For both, the complexity of solving the \((k, k^{1+o(1)})\)-gap problem is \(n/k^{1 \pm o(1)}\). This needs to be contrasted with the fact that solving \((k, \Omega(n))\)-gap edit distance requires \(\Omega(\sqrt{k})\) queries as shown by Batu, Ergun, Kilian, Magen and Raskhodnikova (2003), whereas \((k, \Omega(n))\)-gap Hamming distance can be solved in \(O(1)\) time. </p>



<p>These results are incomparable to those obtained by Goldenberg, Kociumaka, Krauthgamer and Saha (which was discussed in our November 2021 post), where they give a nonadaptive algorithm with complexity \(O(n/k^{1.5})\) for \((k, k^2)\)-gap edit distance problem. The algorithm in the present paper is adaptive and works faster for smaller values of \(k\).</p>

<p><strong>Privately Estimating Graph Parameters in Sublinear time</strong> by Jeremiah Blocki, Elena Grigorescu, Tamalika Mukherjee (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05776">arXiv</a>)</p>



<p>Differentially private approximation algorithms for optimization problems on graphs is a well-studied topic. This paper opens up an exciting research direction by initiating a systematic study of the design of differentially private sublinear-time algorithms. The setting is that graphs are viewed as databases and two graphs are neighboring if they differ in an edge (or a node). An algorithm \(A\) is \(\epsilon\)-differentially private if for every pair of edge-neighboring(or node-neighboring) graphs \(G, G’\) and for every subset \(S\) of outputs, \(\Pr[A(G) \in S] \leq \exp(\epsilon) \cdot \Pr[A(G’) \in S]\).</p>



<p>The paper presents \(\epsilon\)-differentially private sublinear-time algorithms for well-studied problems such as estimating the average degree, the size of a min vertex cover and the size of a maximum matching. These algorithms access the input graphs via <em>neighbor queries</em> and <em>degree queries</em>. </p>



<p>In addition to providing a strong privacy guarantee, their algorithms nearly match the approximation and complexity guarantees of their non-differentially private counterparts. The main idea seems to be the formalization of a sensitivity notion, which they refer to as Global Coupled Sensitivity, and bounding it for the known sublinear-time algorithms for the aforementioned problems. Finally, they add Laplace noise calibrated with this sensitivity value to the output of the algorithms to make them differentially private.  </p>

<p><strong>Testability and Local Certification of Monotone Properties in Minor-closed Classes</strong> by Louis Esperet And Sergey Norin (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00543">arXiv</a>)</p>



<p>One of the major interests in graph property testing is to characterize which properties are testable, i.e, can be \(\epsilon\)-tested with query complexity that depends only on the parameter \(\epsilon\). The question of testability is well-understood in the dense graph model as well as the bounded degree model. This paper concerns itself with testability questions in the general model or the sparse model of graph property testing, where graphs are represented as adjacency lists with no bound on the maximum degree. </p>



<p>The authors prove that every monotone property of<strong> </strong>minor-closed graph classes is testable with one-sided error, where a property is monotone if it is closed under taking subgraphs and a graph class is minor-closed if it is closed under taking minors. A crucial fact to be noted here is that a tester is allowed to make only uniformly random nerighbor queries. </p>



<p>This result is a significant generalization of a 2019 result by Czumaj and Sohler, who proved that for every finite set of graphs \(\mathcal{H}\), every \(\mathcal{H}\)-free property of minor-closed graph classes is testable with one-sided error, where a graph satisfies \(\mathcal{H}\)-freeness if none of its subgraphs belong to \(\mathcal{H}\). </p>



<p>They show an interesting consequence of their results to designing a short local certification scheme for monotone properties of minor-closed graph classes. Roughly speaking, they show the existence of a prover-verifier system for the aforementioned testing problem where proofs of length \(O(\log n)\) are assigned to each vertex and that verifier needs to observe only the proofs assigned to a vertex and its neighbors.<br /></p>



<p><strong>The plane test is a local tester for Multiplicity Codes</strong> by Dan Karliner, Roie Salama, and Amnon Ta-Shma (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/028/">ECCC</a>)</p>



<p>Multiplicity codes are a generalization of Reed-Muller codes and was first studied by Guruswami and Wang (2013) and Kopparty, Saraf and Yekhanin (2014). The messages here are polynomials of degree \(d\) over \(m\) variables and the codeword corresponding to a polynomial \(p\) is the evaluation of \(p\) and of all of its directional derivatives of order upto \(s\) over all the points in \(\mathbb{F}_q^m\), where \(q\) is a prime power. </p>



<p>Even though multiplicity codes are known to be locally decodable, it was open whether they are locally testable. Local testers for Reed Muller codes work by restricting the evaluations to a uniformly random line in \(\mathbb{F}_q^m\) and checking whether it corresponds to the evaluations of a degree \(d\) univariate polynomial. The authors first show that such a tester does not work for the case of multiplicity codes when \(d\) is large. They then show that a <em>plane test</em> is a good local tester for multiplicity codes even for larger values of \(d\). Specifically, a plane test checks whether the restriction of a given word, which is purportedly the evaluation of a polynomial of degree \(d\) and of its derivatives, to a uniformly random plane in \(\mathbb{F}_q^m\) is a bivariate multiplicity code of degree \(d\). </p>



<p></p>



<p>We conclude the post with a short note from Nader Bshouty and Oded Goldreich on a fundamental characterization result in property testing. </p>



<p><strong>On properties that are non-trivial to test</strong> by Nader H. Bshouty and Oded Goldreich (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/013/">ECCC</a>)</p>



<p>A property on binary strings is nontrivial if for infinitely many \(n\), the property contains at least one string of length \(n\) and at most \(2^{n – \Omega(n)}\) strings of length \(n\). The note shows that every nontrivial property requires \(\Omega(1/\epsilon)\) queries to \(\epsilon\)-test. </p></div>

We prove a robust generalization of a Sylvester-Gallai type theorem for quadratic polynomials, generalizing the result in [S'20].
More precisely, given a parameter $0 &lt; \delta \leq 1$ and a finite collection $\mathcal{F}$ of irreducible and pairwise independent polynomials of degree at most 2, we say that $\mathcal{F}$ is a $(\delta, 2)$-radical Sylvester-Gallai configuration if for any polynomial $F_i \in \mathcal{F}$, there exist $\delta(|\mathcal{F}| -1)$ polynomials $F_j$ such that $|\mathrm{rad}(F_i, F_j) \cap \mathcal{F}| \geq 3$, that is, the radical of $F_i, F_j$ contains a third polynomial in the set.

In this work, we prove that any $(\delta, 2)$-radical Sylvester-Gallai configuration $\mathcal{F}$ must be of low dimension: that is 
$$\dim \mathrm{span}(\mathcal{F}) = \mathrm{poly}(1/\delta).$$</div>

To date, we know only a few handcrafted quantified Boolean formulas (QBFs) that are hard for central QBF resolution systems such as Q and QU, and only one specific QBF family to separate Q and QU. 

Here we provide a general method to construct hard formulas for Q and  QU. The construction uses simple propositional formulas (e.g. minimally unsatisfiable formulas) in combination with easy QBF gadgets (Sigma_2^b formulas without constant winning strategies). 
This leads to a host of new hard formulas, including new classes of hard random QBFs. 

We further present generic constructions for formulas separating Q and QU, and for separating Q and LDQ.</div>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>:  A standard assumption for causal inference from observational data is that one has measured a sufficiently rich set of covariates to ensure that within covariates strata, subjects are exchangeable across observed treatment values. Skepticism about the exchangeability assumption in observational studies is often warranted because it hinges on one’s ability to accurately measure covariates capturing all potential sources of confounding. Realistically, confounding mechanisms can rarely if ever, be learned with certainty from measured covariates. One can therefore only ever hope that covariate measurements are at best proxies of true underlying confounding mechanisms operating in an observational study, thus invalidating causal claims made on basis of standard exchangeability conditions.</p>



<p>Causal learning from proxies is a challenging inverse problem which has to date remained unresolved. In this paper, we introduce a formal potential outcome framework for proximal causal learning, which while explicitly acknowledging covariate measurements as imperfect proxies of confounding mechanisms, offers an opportunity to learn about causal effects in settings where exchangeability based on measured covariates fails. Sufficient conditions for nonparametric identification are given, leading to the proximal g-formula and corresponding proximal g-computation algorithm for estimation, both generalizations of Robins’ foundational g-formula and g-computation algorithm, which account explicitly for bias due to unmeasured confounding. Both point treatment and time-varying treatment settings are considered, and an application of proximal g-computation of causal effects is given for illustration.</p>

<p>The last couple of years, for International Women’s Day, I’ve posted about <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/03/08/more-mathematics-books.html">mathematics books by women covered by recently added Wikipedia articles</a>. I have a few more of those that I could list today, and a few more that I plan to add, but instead, I thought I’d list books on mathematics and related areas that look interesting enough to me that I want to add them to Wikipedia, but haven’t, because I haven’t found enough reviews to use as the basis for an article.</p>

<p>If you know of more reviews for these, please let me know! I need at least three in-depth reviews, published in journals or by major societies rather than just on a web site or someone’s blog, by three different reviewers, to be comfortable writing a Wikipedia article. It would also help convince other Wikipedians that the topic is a worthy one for Wikipedia if it had at least one review in an actual journal, not just in the MAA, EMS, AMS, and zbMATH review collections, for which one could argue that a review is “routine coverage” that doesn’t suggest any particular significance for a book. Even if you can’t find more reviews, you might find some of these titles and topics intriguing enough to read the books.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>A Course on Tug-of-War Games with Random Noise</em> (2020), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marta_Lewicka">Marta Lewicka</a>. Research monograph concerning a game-theoretic twist on Brownian motion.

Listed by MathSciNet as “pending” so maybe there’ll be a third review soon.</p>

    <p><em>Alfonso’s Rectifying the Curved</em> (2021), Ruth Glasner and Avinoam Baraness. A history of medieval Spanish circle-squaring. Reviewed by <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/alfonsos-rectifying-the-curved">MAA</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Bodies of Constant Width: An Introduction to Convex Geometry with Applications</em> (2019), Horst Martini, Luis Montejano, and Déborah Oliveros. A very thorough reference on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_of_constant_width">surfaces of constant width</a> and related topics, one that I’ve used as a reference in several other Wikipedia articles.

A polynomial that can be represented as a sum of squares of other polynomials automatically takes only positive values, although the converse is untrue. This book concerns both the mathematical foundations and computational aspects of this topic. MathSciNet lists it only as “preliminary” and zbMATH gives only a publisher blurb.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>The Classification of Quadrilaterals: A Study in Definition</em> (2008), Zalman Usiskin and Jennifer Griffin. This calls itself a “micro-curricular analysis” in mathematics education, on the best way to organize basic definitions of four-sided shapes in elementary geometry. The mathematics education community is usually pretty good about reviewing their books, but I haven’t found any reviews for this one.</p>
  </li>

<p class="justify-text">Symmetric positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices come up in a variety of places in machine learning, statistics, and optimization, and more generally in most domains of applied mathematics. When estimating or optimizing over the set of such matrices, several geometries can be used. The most direct one is to consider PSD matrices as a convex set in the vector space of all symmetric matrices and thus to inherit the Euclidean geometry. Like for the positive orthant (which corresponds to diagonal PSD matrices), this is not natural for a variety of reasons. In this post we will consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bregman_divergence">Bregman divergences</a> to define our notion of geometry.</p>



<p class="justify-text">A first natural and common geometry is to consider PSD matrices as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_matrix">covariance matrices</a> (or their inverses, often referred to a precision or concentration matrices). They can thus be seen as parameters of zero-mean Gaussian random vectors, and classical notions from information theory, such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence, can be brought to bear to define a specific geometry. This happens to be equivalent to using the negative log determinant to define the Bregman divergence, and leads to the usual Stein divergence $$ – \log \det A + \log \det B \ – {\rm tr}[ – B^{\, -1} ( A \, – B) ] =  -\log \det (AB^{\, -1}) + {\rm tr}( A B^{\, -1}) + d, $$ which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution#Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence">Kullback Leibler divergence</a> between two Gaussian random vectors with zero means and covariance matrices \(B\) and \(A\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, we consider a different but related matrix function, which will be \(A \mapsto {\rm tr }  [ A \log A]\) instead of \(– {\rm tr} [ \log A ]\). This will have stronger links with the Shannon entropy of discrete random variables [1]. In particular, we will be able to extend two classical notions related to discrete entropy:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>The entropy function \(H(p) = \ – \sum_{i=1}^d p_i \log p_i\), defined on the simplex \(\Delta \subset \mathbb{R}^d\) (vectors with non-negative components that sum to one), is concave, while the associated Bregman divergence, here the usual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence">Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence</a>, is $$ \sum_{i=1}^d p_i \log \frac{p_i}{q_i}. $$ It is jointly convex in the vectors \(p\) and \(q\) (see this nice article [<a href="http://carma.newcastle.edu.au/resources/jon/Preprints/Books/CUP/CUPold/MaterialI/bregman.pdf">6</a>] for other jointly convex Bregman divergences). Note that the joint convexity is here a direct application of classical results regarding the convexity of the perspective of a convex function [<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf">10</a>, section 3.2.6].</li><li>The Fenchel-Legendre conjugate of \(-H\) (with the simplex as domain) is $$\sup_{p \in \Delta} \ \ p^\top z\ – \sum_{i=1}^d p_i \log p_i = \log \Big( \sum_{i=1}^d \exp(z_i) \Big).$$ With the positive orthant as the domain, we have $$\sup_{p \in \mathbb{R}_+^d }\ \ p^\top z \ – \sum_{i=1}^d p_i \log p_i = \sum_{i=1}^d \exp(z_i-1) .$$ This has many consequences in probabilistic modelling, notably the duality between maximum likelihood and maximum entropy [1, <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wainwrig/Papers/WaiJor08_FTML.pdf">7</a>].</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">The extension to matrices will have several interesting consequences:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>This defines a Bregman divergence that has interesting applications to mirror descent and smoothing techniques in optimization.</li><li>The non-trivial joint convexity of the associated Bregman divergence will lead to elegant methods for deriving concentration inequalities for symmetric matrices [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01571">2</a>].</li><li>Application to covariance operators in infinite-dimensional spaces will lead to a whole range of information-theoretic results [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">5</a>], but this is for next month!</li></ul>



<h2 id="von-neumann-entropy-and-relative-entropy">Von Neumann entropy and relative entropy</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Given a positive semi-definite symmetric matrix \(A \in \mathcal{S}_d\), the von Neumann entropy is defined as $$H(A) =\ – {\rm tr} [ A \log A],$$ as the trace of the matrix function \(– A \log A\), or equivalently as \(– \sum_{i=1}^d \! \lambda_i \log \lambda_i\) where \(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_d \geqslant 0\) are the \(d\) eigenvalues of \(A\) (note that we can have a zero eigenvalue and still be finite). </p>



<p class="justify-text">From <a href="https://francisbach.com/matrix-monotony-and-convexity/">last month blog post</a>, we get that \(H\) is concave. We can then naturally define on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrahedron">spectrahedron</a> (set of positive semi-definite matrices with unit trace), the <em>relative entropy</em>, which is the Bregman divergence associated with the function \(A \mapsto {\rm tr} [ A \log A]\), whose gradient is \(\log A + I \), leading to: $$D(A\| B) = {\rm tr} [ A \log A ] \, – {\rm tr} [ B \log B] \, – {\rm tr} \big[ ( A \, – B) ( \log B + I ) \big],$$ which is equal to $$ D(A\| B) = {\rm tr} \big[ A ( \log A \,  – \log B ) \big] – {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B).$$ This time we have to be careful to avoid infinite values: it is finite if and only if the null space of \(B\) is included in the one of \(A\), or, equivalently if \(B^{\, -1/2} A^{1/2} B^{\, -1/2}\) is finite. Note that when \(A\) and \(B\) have unit traces, the term in \(– {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B)\) goes away.</p>



<p class="justify-text">As a Bregman divergence of a strictly convex function, \(D(A\|B)\) is non-negative and equal to zero if and only if \(A = B\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">When \(A = {\rm Diag}(p)\) and \(B = {\rm Diag}(q)\) are diagonal, we get $$D(A\| B) = \sum_{i=1}^d \Big\{ p_i \log \frac{p_i}{q_i} \, – p_i + q_i \Big\},$$ and we recover the traditional relative entropy. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Please refrain from writing \(D(A\| B) = {\rm tr} \big[ A \log ( A B^{\,-1} ) \big] – {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B)\), which is not true unless \(A\) and \(B\) commute. See however below how using Kronecker products can make a similar equality always true.</p>



<h2>A geometry on matrices</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The von Neumann relative entropy (also referred to as matrix KL divergence) defines a new notion of geometry, which is different from the Euclidean geometry based on the squared Frobenius norm \(\| A – B \|_{\rm F}^2 = {\rm tr} [ ( A -B)^2]\). Below, we plot and compare balls for these various geometries. We first consider Euclidean balls, defined as $$\mbox{ Euclidean : } \  \big\{ B \in \mathcal{S}_d,  \| A – B \|_{\rm F}^2 \leqslant r \big\},$$ as well as the two KL balls (one for each side of the KL divergence): $$ \mbox{ Left KL : } \ \big\{ B \in \mathcal{S}_d,  D(B\|A)  \leqslant r \big\},$$ $$\mbox{ Right KL : } \big\{ B \in \mathcal{S}_d,  D(A\|B) \leqslant r \big\}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Diagonal matrices with unit trace (isomorphic to the simplex).</strong> We consider diagonal matrices \(A = {\rm Diag}(p)\) with \(p\) in the simplex. We compare the three balls below (in yellow), with \(r = 1/16\) for the three of them.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="1480" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/simplex_geom.gif" class="wp-image-6794" height="340" /></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">While the Euclidean balls have the same shapes at all positions, the KL balls adapt their shapes to their centers.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Unit trace PSD matrices in dimension two (isomorphic to the Euclidean ball).</strong> We consider matrices \(A = \Big( \begin{array}{cc} x &amp; y \\[-.15cm] y &amp; \!\!\!1-x\!\end{array} \Big)\) with the PSD constraint being equivalent to \(y^2 \leqslant x(1-x)\), that is, \((x,y)\) is in the disk of center \((\frac{1}{2},0)\) and radius \(\frac{1}{2}\). We compare the three balls below (in yellow), with \(r = \frac{1}{32}\) for the Euclidean ball, and \(r =\frac{1}{16}\) for the KL balls, with a similar difference between geometries.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="1486" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ellipsoid_geom.gif" class="wp-image-6798" height="422" /></figure></div>



<h2 id="pinsker-inequality-1">Pinsker inequality</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In order to use the relative entropy within mirror descent, we need an extension of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinsker%27s_inequality">Pinsker inequality</a> $$\sum_{i=1}^d p_i \log \frac{p_i}{q_i} \geqslant \frac{1}{2} \Big(\sum_{i=1}^d | p_i – q_i| \Big)^2,$$ which is, in optimization terms, the \(1\)-strong-concavity of the entropy with respect to the \(\ell_1\)-norm. It turns out that the natural extension is true, that is, for PSD matrices with unit trace, $$D(A\| B) =  {\rm tr} \big[ A ( \log A\,   – \log B ) \big] \geqslant \frac{1}{2} \| A \ – B \|_\ast^2,$$ where \(\| \cdot \|_\ast\) denotes the trace norm, a.k.a. the nuclear norm, that is, the \(\ell_1\)-norm of eigenvalues. See [<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~yaoliang/mynotes/sc.pdf">3</a>] for a nice and simple proof.</p>



<p class="justify-text">This allows to use the relative entropy when optimizing over the spectrahedron using mirror descent [<a href="https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~nemirovs/MLOptChapterI.pdf">11</a>]. Note that the diameter \(\sup_{A} {\rm tr} [ A \log A] \ –   \inf_{A} {\rm tr} [ A \log A] \) over PSD matrices with unit trace is equal to \(\log d\). Using duality, the relative entropy can also be used for smoothing the maximal eigenvalue of a matrix [<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10107-006-0001-8.pdf">12</a>].</p>



<h2 id="joint-convexity-of-matrix-relative-entropy">Joint convexity of matrix relative entropy</h2>



<p class="justify-text">While the convexity with respect to \(A\) is straightforward, the relative entropy \(D(A \| B)\) is also <em>jointly</em> convex in \((A,B)\), which is crucial in the developments below. There exist several proofs, but one is particularly elegant [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0604206.pdf">4</a>] and will use the matrix-monotonicity that I presented in the <a href="https://francisbach.com/matrix-monotony-and-convexity/">last post</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Kronecker products.</strong> We need to make a clever use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_product">Kronecker products</a>. Given two matrices \(A\) and \(B\) of any sizes, \(A \otimes B\) is the matrix defined by blocks \(A_{ij} B\), thus of size the products of the number of rows and columns of \(A\) and \(B\). In the derivations below, both \(A\) and \(B\) will be of size \(d \times d\), and thus \(A \otimes B\) is then of size \(d^2 \times d^2\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Kronecker products have very nice properties (they would probably deserve their own post!), such as (when dimensions are compatible), \((A \otimes B) ( C\otimes D) = (AC) \otimes (BD)\) or \((A \otimes B)^{\, -1} = A^{-1} \otimes B^{\, -1}\). What we will leverage is their use in characterizing linear operations on matrices. For a rectangular matrix \(X \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1 \times d_2}\), \({\rm vec}(X) \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1 d_2 \times 1}\) denotes the <em>vectorization</em> of \(X\) obtained by stacking all columns of \(X\) one after the other in a single column vector. Then, we have $$ (B^\top \otimes A){\rm vec}(X) = {\rm vec}(AXB)$$ for any \(A, X, B\) with compatible dimensions. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Reformulation of relative entropy.</strong> We can now use Kronecker products to get: $$ {\rm tr} [A \log A] = {\rm tr}[ A^{1/2}( \log A) A^{1/2} ] = {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top [ I \otimes \log A ] {\rm vec}(A^{1/2}),$$ and $$ {\rm tr} [A \log B] = {\rm tr} [ A^{1/2}( \log B) A^{1/2} ] = {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top [    \log B \otimes I  ] {\rm vec}(A^{1/2}),$$ leading to $$D(A\|B) = {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top \big[ I \otimes \log A \ – \log B \otimes I \big]  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2}) \, – {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B).$$ The key element is then to use the identity for PSD matrices $$\log(C \otimes D) = \log C \otimes I + I \otimes \log D$$ (which can be shown using the fact that eigenvalue decomposition of a Kronecker product of symmetric matrices can be obtained from the decompositions of the factors), leading to $$D(A\|B) = {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top \big[ \log ( I \otimes A) \ – \log (B \otimes I) \big]  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})\, – {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B).$$ It seems we have not achieved much, but now, the matrices \( I \otimes A\) and \(B \otimes I\) commute! Therefore, we can now write $$D(A\|B) = {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top \Big[ \log \big( ( I \otimes A) (B \otimes I)^{-1} \big) \Big]  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})- {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B).$$ This can then be rewritten as $$D(A\|B)  =\, – {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top \big[ \log ( B \otimes A^{-1}) \big] {\rm vec}(A^{1/2}) \, – {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B).$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Using matrix-convexity.</strong> We can now use the matrix-convexity of \(\lambda \mapsto \ – \log \lambda\), and the representation from <a href="http://francisbach.com/matrix-monotony-and-convexity/">last post</a> as $$ -\log \lambda = 1-\lambda + (\lambda-1)^2 \int_0^{+\infty} \!\!\frac{1}{\lambda +u} \frac{du}{(1+u)^2},$$ leading to $$D(A\|B) =  \int_0^{+\infty}  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top \Big[ ( B\otimes A^{-1} – I)^2 (B\otimes A^{-1} + u I)^{-1} \Big]  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2}) \frac{du}{(1+u)^2},$$ and then, by using  \(( B\otimes A^{-1} – I) ( I \otimes A^{1/2})  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})  =  {\rm vec}(B-A)\), $$D(A\|B) =   \int_0^{+\infty}  {\rm vec}(A-B)^\top  (B\otimes I+ u I \otimes A)^{-1}   {\rm vec}(A-B)   \frac{du}{(1+u)^2}.$$ We can then use the joint convexity of the function \((C,D) \mapsto {\rm tr} \big[  C^\top D^{-1} C \big] \) to get the  joint convexity of \(D(A\|B)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">This extends to all matrix-convex functions beyond the logarithm, such as \(\lambda \mapsto (\lambda-1)^2\), \(\lambda \mapsto 1 \, – \lambda^{1/2}\) or \(\displaystyle \lambda \mapsto \frac{1}{\lambda}(\lambda-1)^2\), leading to other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-divergence">\(f\)-divergences</a> between matrices. See [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">5</a>, Appendix A.4] for details.</p>



<h2 id="lieb-concavity-theorems">Lieb concavity theorems</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Now that \((A,B) \mapsto D(A\|B)\) is jointly convex on all PSD matrices (not only unit trace), for any fixed symmetric matrix \(M\), the function $$ \varphi: B \mapsto \sup_{ A \succcurlyeq 0} \ {\rm tr}(AM) + {\rm tr}(A) \ – D(A\|B), $$ as the partial maximization (with respect to \(B\)) of a jointly concave function of \((A,B)\), is concave. We can maximize in closed form with respect to \(A\) by computing the gradient \(M \ – \log A  + \log B\), leading to \(A = \exp( M + \log B)\), and $$\varphi(B) = {\rm tr} \exp ( M + \log B),$$ which defines a concave function. This is one version of the classical Lieb concavity theorems [<a href="http://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000187087390011X/pdf?md5=09b7ceaa543358cef395fa6af8de62aa&amp;pid=1-s2.0-000187087390011X-main.pdf">8</a>]. </p>



<p class="justify-text">As a consequence, we can obtain the “subadditivity of the matrix cumulant generative function”. That is, for any random <em>independent</em> symmetric matrices \(X_1,\dots,X_n\) of the same sizes, $$ \mathbb{E} \Big[  {\rm tr} \exp \big(   \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \big) \Big] \leqslant {\rm tr} \exp \big( \sum_{i=1}^n \log \big( \mathbb{E} [ \exp( X_i ) ] \big),$$ which can be shown by recursion using Jensen’s inequality for the function \(\varphi\) above with a well-chosen matrix \(M\). See [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01571">2</a>] for details.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We are now ready to consider concentration inequalities for random matrices.</p>



<h2 id="application-to-concentration-inequalities">Application to concentration inequalities</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider random independent random matrices \(X_1,\dots,X_n\) such that \(\mathbb{E} [ X_i ] = 0\) for all \(i \in \{1,\dots,n\}\). Let \(S = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \! X_i\) (which has zero mean). Our goal is to provide upper bounds on \(\mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \big]\) and \(\mathbb{P} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \geqslant t \big]\). We follow the outstanding work and presentation of <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~jtropp/">Joel Tropp</a> [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01571">2</a>]: using the proper matrix tools presented above, we can get for matrix-valued random variables the almost exact same proofs of the usual concentration inequalities for real-valued random <em>variables</em>, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoeffding%27s_inequality">Hoeffding</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein_inequalities_(probability_theory)">Bernstein</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azuma%27s_inequality">Azuma</a>, or Mac-Diarmid inequalities. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Expectation. </strong>We have, for any \(u &gt; 0\), by homogeneity of the largest eigenvalue: $$  \mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \big] = \frac{1}{u}  \mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(uS) \big] =  \frac{1}{u}  \mathbb{E} \big[  \log \exp ( \lambda_{\max}(uS) ) \big].$$ We can then use Jensen’s inequality for the logarithm to get (together with the fact the largest eigenvalue of the exponential is the exponential of the largest eigenvalue): $$  \mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \big] \leqslant \frac{1}{u}  \log \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp ( \lambda_{\max}(uS) ) \big]=\frac{1}{u}  \log \mathbb{E} \big[ ( \lambda_{\max}( \exp ( uS) ) \big], $$ and finally that for a PSD matrix the trace is larger than the largest eigenvalue, to get $$  \mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \big] \leqslant \frac{1}{u}  \log \mathbb{E} \big[ {\rm tr} \exp (  uS ) \big].$$ Experts in concentration inequalities have probably recognized the usual argument to bound the expectation of the maximum of \(d\) random <em>real-valued</em> (non necessarily independent) variables \(X_1,\dots,X_d\), as $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ \max \{Y_1,\dots,Y_d\} \big] \leqslant \frac{1}{u} \log \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp(uY_1)+ \cdots + \exp(u Y_d) \big].$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Tail bound.</strong> We have, using Markov’s inequality, for any \(u &gt; 0\): $$\mathbb{P} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \geqslant t \big] = \mathbb{P} \big[ \exp(\lambda_{\max}(uS)) \geqslant \exp(ut) \big] \leqslant e^{-ut} \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp ( \lambda_{\max}(uS) ) \big],$$ thus leading to $$\mathbb{P} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \geqslant t \big] \leqslant e^{-ut} \mathbb{E} \big[ {\rm tr} \exp (  uS ) \big].$$ The same experts have recognized $$ \mathbb{P} \big[ \max \{Y_1,\dots,Y_d\} \geqslant t \big] \leqslant  e^{-ut} \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp(uY_1)+ \cdots + \exp(u Y_d) \big].$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">We can now consider random matrices such that \(a I \preccurlyeq X_i \preccurlyeq b I\) almost surely for all \(i=1,\dots,n\) (and still with zero mean). We first need a lemma whose proof is given at the end of the post, with the exact same proof as for the uni-dimensional case.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Lemma.</strong> If \(\mathbb{E} [ X ] = 0\) and \(a I \preccurlyeq X \preccurlyeq b I\) almost surely, then for all \(u &gt; 0\), $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp( u X) \big] \preccurlyeq \exp\big( \frac{u^2}{8}(b-a)^2 \big) I.$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">Together with the consequence of Lieb’s result presented above and the matrix-monotonicity of the logarithm, we get: $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ {\rm tr} \exp (  uS ) \big] \leqslant {\rm tr} \exp \Big( n \big( \frac{u^2}{8n^2}(b-a)^2 I \big) \Big) = d  \exp \big(   \frac{u^2}{8n}(b-a)^2 \big).$$ We can then get immediately, by optimizing with respect to \(u\) (with optimal value \(u=4 n t /(b-a)^2\)), $$\mathbb{P} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \geqslant t \big] \leqslant d \exp\big( – \frac{2 n t^2 }{(b-a)^2} \big),$$ and, with optimal value \(u= {2 \sqrt{2 n \log d }}/ { (b-a) }\): $$  \mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \big] \leqslant \frac{b-a}{\sqrt{2n}} \sqrt{ \log d}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that these are the exact same results as when \(d=1\)! </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Extensions.</strong> As nicely detailed in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01571">2</a>], there are extensions to all classical concentration inequalities. Moreover, this can be applied to rectangular matrices, where the largest eigenvalue is replaced by the largest singular value. Finally, for those who like to work in infinite dimensions and cannot bear the explicit dependence in dimension, it is possible to derive results that depend only on a well-defined notion of “intrinsic dimension” (the associated results can then be used for the study of kernel methods, see [<a href="http://di.ens.fr/~fbach/ltfp_book.pdf">13</a>, chapter 9]).</p>



<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Now that we know everything about the matrix relative entropy and its convexity properties, we will explore next month a new link between eigenvalues of covariance operators and the regular Shannon entropy of the generating probability distribution [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">5</a>], thus mixing my favorite recent mathematical topic with my probably all-time favorite one: positive definite kernels!</p>

<h2 id="proof-of-lemma-on-matrix-cumulant-generating-functions">Proof of lemma on matrix cumulant generating functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Lemma.</strong> If \(\mathbb{E} [ X ] = 0\) and \(a I \preccurlyeq X \preccurlyeq b I\) almost surely, then for all \(u &gt; 0\), $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp( u X) \big] \preccurlyeq \exp\big( \frac{u^2}{8}(b-a)^2 I \big) =  \exp\big( \frac{u^2}{8}(b-a)^2 \big) I .$$ Note that we have \(a \leqslant 0 \leqslant b\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Proof</strong>. We follow the standard proof [9] for real-valued random variables, simply transferred to the matrix case. On the interval \([a,b]\), by convexity of the exponential function $$ \exp(u\lambda) \leqslant \exp(ub) \frac{\lambda-a}{b-a} + \exp(ua) \frac{b \, – \lambda}{b-a}.$$ Thus (check why we can do this), almost surely: $$ \exp(uX) \preccurlyeq \exp(ub) \frac{X-a I }{b-a} + \exp(ua) \frac{bI  – X}{b-a},$$ leading to \(\displaystyle \mathbb{E} [ \exp(uX) ]  \preccurlyeq   \frac{b \exp(ua)\ – a \exp(ub)}{b-a} I\). We can then show that \(\displaystyle \frac{b \exp(ua)\ – a \exp(ub)}{b-a}  \leqslant \exp \Big(  \frac{u^2}{8}(b-a)^2 \Big)\) to conclude the proof. We thus need to show that \(\displaystyle \psi(u) = \log \Big( \frac{b \exp(ua)\ – a \exp(ub)}{b-a}  \Big) \leqslant \frac{u^2}{8}(b-a)^2\) for all \(u \geqslant 0\). We can simply express \(\psi(u)\) as a rescaled logistic function as $$\psi(u) =  ua + \log \frac{b}{b-a} + \log\Big[ 1 + \exp\Big( u(b-a) + \log\frac{-a}{b-a} \Big) \Big].$$ We have \(\psi(0) = 0\), and $$\psi'(u) =  \frac{ba \exp(ua)\ – ab \exp(ub)}{b \exp(ua)\ – a \exp(ub)}, $$ thus \(\psi'(0) = 0\), and through the link with the logistic function, the second-order derivarive is less than \((b-a)^2 / 4\). This leads to the desired result by Taylor’s formula.</p>

A seminal result in learning theory characterizes the PAC learnability of binary classes through the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension. Extending this characterization to the general multiclass setting has been open since the pioneering works on multiclass PAC learning in the late 1980s. This work resolves this problem: we characterize multiclass PAC learnability through the DS dimension, a combinatorial dimension defined by Daniely and Shalev-Shwartz (2014). 

The classical characterization of the binary case boils down to empirical risk minimization. In contrast, our characterization of the multiclass case involves a variety of algorithmic ideas; these include a natural setting we call list PAC learning. In the list learning setting, instead of predicting a single outcome for a given unseen input, the goal is to provide a short menu of predictions. 

Our second main result concerns the Natarajan dimension, which has been a central candidate for characterizing multiclass learnability. This dimension was introduced by Natarajan (1988) as a barrier for PAC learning. Whether the Natarajan dimension characterizes PAC learnability in general has been posed as an open question in several papers since. This work provides a negative answer: we construct a non-learnable class with Natarajan dimension one. 

For the construction, we identify a fundamental connection between concept classes and topology (i.e., colorful simplicial complexes). We crucially rely on a deep and involved construction of hyperbolic pseudo-manifolds by Januszkiewicz and Swiatkowski. It is interesting that hyperbolicity is directly related to learning problems that are difficult to solve although no obvious barriers exist. This is another demonstration of the fruitful links machine learning has with different areas in mathematics.</div>

<div class="content">
<p> 1) My first thought was: Doesn't Putin know that his army (and his society) is corrupt and people are promoted on loyalty rather than talent, hence the invasion is not going to work? But then note</p><p>a) He invaded Georgia (the country not the state)</p><p>b) He annexed Crimea</p><p>c) NATO agreeing on sanctions? They can't even agree on what to have for lunch.  </p><p>d) The above question ASSUMES that he will lose. This is not clear yet.</p><p>2) The US and other countries are imposing sanctions. Visa, MC, and Netflix have withdrawn from Russia. Will these cause Putin to stop, or will they just impose hardships on the citizens without having an affect? I ask non-rhetorically. Foreign Policy is hard, though I suspect Biden has hired experts and is listening to them. Doesn't mean they are right. </p><p>3) This seems like a case where its obvious that Putin is in the wrong so I was surprised to see some Pro-Putin arguments. To be fair, some were more that we should not get involved, which is not quite Pro Putin. Here are some and my thoughts on them.</p><p>a) Putin never called me a racist and never made my kids learn Critical Race Theory. This is meant as a GOTCHA comment. To take it seriously one would have to (1) examine what American's are learning in grade school, (2) examine what Russians are learning in grade school, (3) see which country is giving their students a more honest view of things (particularly history), and (4) decide that whichever school is teaching more honest material deserves are support. </p><p>b) Putin is a strong leader and I admire strong leaders. Really? If  Biden was a strong leader who could push through the Build-Back-Better plan, would you admire that? You can't just admire strong leaders in the abstract, you have to see where they lead. (Same with admiring people who have principles.)</p><p>c) Putin stands for good Christian values. OH- so Putin likes to help the poor and does not approve of divorce or pre-marital sex. Oh, that NOT what you mean? Oh, you just mean that he does not like gay people or abortion. OH, thats not correct- Russia has the second most number of abortions of any country (see <a href="https://www.worldblaze.in/countries-with-highest-abortion-rates/">here</a>) So the only issue where Russia shares your values is in not liking gay people. Is that enough  commonality is enough to justify invading a country? This does raise the serious question: who do you support in a war? The country that shrares your values? The country that didn't start it (sometimes hard to tell, though not in this case)? The country you have a treaty with? These are good and serious questions. </p><p>d) How come the world does not like Putin's war based on lies and had no problem with W's war on Iraq that was based on lies? This is actually a good question. Being an academic by first impulse is to write a paper on it. There are differences between the invasion of Ukraine and Gulf War II, but still, lets assume that they really are somewhat equivalent. The person asking the question was probably AGAINST Gulf War II. Hence they should be against the invasion of Ukraine as well. So this is a good question about the America and NATO's Double standard and hypocrisy but is not a reason to be pro-Putin. (I was emailed that there are many conflicts that American and NATO do not care about that are as bad as Putin's invasion.) </p><p>e) Russia had real concerns about security. The last time Russia was invaded was WW II (if I am wrong then please correct me in the comments). Even so, I've heard analogies made to America freaking out when Cuba had Nuclear missiles. There were no nukes in Ukraine. Ukraine was not going to join NATO anytime soon. I wonder if this was a pretense on Putin's part and not a real reason. </p><p>f) See <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2022/3/4/2083726/-This-week-in-QAnon-Chronicles-Ukraine-enters-the-conspiracy">here</a>. I give an excerpt (I am not making this up). </p><p>But as its Covid mission has become less clear, the group’s channels have turned to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where conspiracy-minded thinking has flourished. While some group members have admonished Russian President Vladimir Putin for the invasion, QAnon and anti-vaccine contingents within the groups have seized on a false conspiracy theory that the war is a cover for a military operation backed by former President Donald Trump in Ukraine.</p><p>The conspiracy theory, which is baseless and has roots in QAnon mythology, alleges that Trump and Putin are secretly working together to stop bioweapons from being made by Dr. Anthony Fauci in Ukraine and that shelling in Ukraine has targeted the secret laboratories. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has emerged in the past year as a main target for far-right conspiracy theories.</p><p>3) I was somewhat surprised when Hungary came out against Putin. But Putin's arrangments with his allies are transactional- there is no real love there. I was much more surprised when Switzerland came out against Putin. Switzerland has been neutral since 1515 (I think I read that some place). </p><div><br /></div><p><br /></p></div>

<div class="content">
We analyze the Fourier growth, i.e. the $L_1$ Fourier weight at level $k$ (denoted $L_{1,k}$),  of read-once regular branching programs.
We prove that every read-once regular branching program $B$ of width $w \in [1,\infty]$ with $s$ accepting states on $n$-bit inputs must have its $L_{1,k}$ bounded by
$$
  \min\left\{ \Pr[B(U_n)=1] (w-1)^k , s \cdot O\left((n \log n)/k\right)^{\frac{k-1}{2}} \right\}.
$$
For any constant $k$, our result is tight up to constant factors for the AND function on $w-1$ bits, and is tight up to polylogarithmic factors for unbounded width programs. In particular, for $k=1$ we have $L_{1,1}(B)\leq s$, with no dependence on the width $w$ of the program.

Our result gives new bounds on the coin problem and new pseudorandom generators (PRGs). Furthermore, we obtain an explicit generator for unordered permutation branching programs of unbounded width with a constant factor stretch, where no PRG was previously known.

Applying a composition theorem of B{\l}asiok, Ivanov, Jin, Lee, Servedio and Viola (RANDOM 2021), we extend our results to ``generalized group products,'' a generalization of modular sums and product tests.</div>

We prove that a modification of Andreev's function is not computable by $(3 + \alpha - \varepsilon) \log{n}$ depth De Morgan formula with $(2\alpha - \varepsilon)\log{n}$ layers of AND gates at the top for any $1/5 &gt; \alpha &gt; 0$ and any constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. In order to do this, we prove a weak variant of Karchmer-Raz-Wigderson conjecture. To be more precise, we prove the existence of two functions $f \colon \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ and $g \colon \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$ such that $f(g(x) \oplus y)$ is not computable by depth $(1 + \alpha - \varepsilon) n$ formulas with $(2 \alpha - \varepsilon) n$ layers of AND gates at the top. We do this by a top-down approach, which was only used before for depth-$3$ model. 

Our technical contribution includes combinatorial insights into structure of composition with random boolean function, which led us to introducing a notion of well-mixed sets. A set of functions is well-mixed if, when composed with a random function, it does not have subsets that agree on large fractions of inputs. We use probabilistic method to prove the existence of well-mixed sets.</div>

<p>
I am now carrying a full power CPU embedded in my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberman">chest</a>. If I could use it directly I would have new powers, but it is dedicated to monitor my heart function. Alas.<br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/05/i-am-now-a-cyberman/bed/" rel="attachment wp-att-19722"><img width="285" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/bed.png?resize=285%2C300&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-19722" height="300" /></a></p>
<p></p><h2> The Procedure </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
My heart has not been beating well. So they had to implant a device that monitors the heart and also can restart the beating if needed. It was not a long operation—about one hour—but took two days recovering in the hospital. </p>
<p>
The worst part of the recovery is that it is not restful. And it is boring. I am now home and resting much better.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Am I Turing Universal? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Well, according to Alan Turing, I was universal as soon as I began to use my brain. But can I leverage my new processing power?</p>
<p>
The doctors told Kathryn that some ideas from DNA computing went into my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantable_cardioverter-defibrillator">ICD</a> device. Of course, I cannot implement any DNA computing algorithms on my device. </p>
<p>
I wonder, however, whether I can get useful outputs by varying the input—such as my pulse. Maybe I do not want to experiment on myself there. But it is not too far-fetched to imagine that in the not too distant future many of us could be controlling computations with our heartbeats. Or at least powering them while controlling with brainwaves. Call it “heartbeat computing”—?</p>
<p>
Ken has a more immediate concern: could the computing power in the device be used to cheat at chess? Already many chess tournament prohibit electronic physio devices, even watches, because of this potential. A cognitive <em>implant</em>, however, could bend the rules on what it means to be a human player.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I want to thank all who sent some best wishes. I really thank you all for your thoughts. </p>
<p>
I must also especially thank my dear wife Dr.Kathryn Farley for her tremendous support. And also thank Ken for helping her make some calls on our behalf. Thank you both.</p>

<h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02703">The Amplituhedron BCFW Triangulation</a> by Chaim Even-Zohar, Tsviqa Lakrec, and Ran Tessler</h3>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  <span class="abstract-short has-text-grey-dark mathjax" id="2112.02703v4-abstract-short">The amplituhedron <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7Bn%2Ck%2C4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="A_{n,k,4}" class="latex" />  is a geometric object, introduced by Arkani-Hamed and Trnka (2013) in the study of scattering amplitudes in quantum field theories. They conjecture that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7Bn%2Ck%2C4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="A_{n,k,4}" class="latex" /> admits a decomposition into images of BCFW positroid cells, arising from the Britto–Cachazo–Feng–Witten recurrence (2005). We prove that this conjecture is true.</span></p>
<p>Congratulations to Chaim, Tsviqa, and Ran!</p>
<p>Quick remarks:</p>
<ol>
<li>The introduction to the paper give a very friendly introduction of the topic as well as a variety of results between 2013 and today.</li>
<li>Ran Tessler gave recently a lovely colloquium talk about the result in Tel Aviv University, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-uKYef392Fc3HrgyxJzRED6U8p0nqsR7/view?usp=sharing">here are the slides</a>.</li>
<li>For a 2015 post about these objects and some thoughts about the combinatorial side: <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/02/16/the-simplex-the-cyclic-polytope-the-positroidron-the-amplituhedron-and-beyond/" rel="bookmark">The Simplex, the Cyclic polytope, the Positroidron, the Amplituhedron, and Beyond.</a> See also this post for <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/01/20/midrasha-mathematicae-18-in-and-around-combinatorics/">a related lecture series by Alexander Postnikov.</a> (Here are <a href="https://4gravitons.com/category/amplitudes-methods/">quite a few blog posts</a> on the physics side from “4-gravitons”.)</li>

<p>(Click for a larger image.) <span style="color: #ff0000;">Questions that arise naturally: </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Is there an analog for the “moment curve”? Are there analogs for “neighborly polytopes”? </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Do amplituhedra maximize numbers of cells or related parameters like the cyclic polytopes do? </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Are they amplituhedra “universal” objects like vertices of the cyclic polytopes? </span></p></div>

<p>Are you interested in combinatorial mathematics? If so, I am happy to welcome you to the future! </p><p>I am proud to share with you a new, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07715" target="_blank">99-page preprint</a> by three colleagues from my department (<a href="https://permutatriangle.github.io/authors/bean.html" target="_blank">Christian Bean</a>, <a href="https://permutatriangle.github.io/authors/nadeau.html" target="_blank">Émile Nadeau </a>and <a href="https://permutatriangle.github.io/authors/ulfarsson.html" target="_blank">Henning Ulfarsson</a>) and three of their collaborators (<a href="http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staffpriv/malbert/index.php" target="_blank">Michael Albert</a>, <a href="https://akc.is/" target="_blank">Anders Claesson</a> and <a href="http://jaypantone.com/" target="_blank">Jay Pantone</a>) that is the result of years of work that led to the birth of  Combinatorial Exploration.   <i>Combinatorial Exploration</i> is an algorithmic framework that can prove results that so far have required the ingenuity of human combinatorialists. More specifically, it can study, at the press of a button, the structure of combinatorial objects and derive their counting sequences and generating functions. The applicability and power of Combinatorial Exploration are witnessed by the applications to the domain of permutation patterns given in the paper. My colleagues use it to re-derive <i>hundreds</i> of results in the literature in a uniform manner and prove many new ones. See the <a href="https://permpal.com/" target="_blank">Permutation Pattern Avoidance Library (PermPAL)</a> and Section 2.4 of the article for a more comprehensive list of notable results. The paper also gives three additional proofs-of-concept, showing examples of how Combinatorial Exploration can prove results in the domains of alternating sign matrices, polyominoes, and set partitions. Last, but by no means least, the github repository at <a href="https://github.com/PermutaTriangle/comb_spec_searcher">https://github.com/PermutaTriangle/comb_spec_searcher</a> contains the open-source python framework for Combinatorial Exploration, and the one at <a href="https://github.com/PermutaTriangle/Tilings">https://github.com/PermutaTriangle/Tilings</a> contains the code needed to apply it to the field of permutation patterns. </p><p> "Det er svært at spå, især om fremtiden", as Niels Bohr and Piet Hein famously said. However, let me stick my neck out and predict that this work will have substantial impact and will be the basis for exciting future work. </p><p> Congratulations  to my colleagues! With my department chair hat on, I am very proud to see work of this quality stem from my department and humbled by what my colleagues have achieved already. As an interested observer, I am very excited to see what their algorithms will be able to prove in the future. For the moment, let's all enjoy what they have done already. <br /></p></div>
