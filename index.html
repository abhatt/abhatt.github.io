<p>Ken Regan is of course my partner on GLL. He is faculty in the computer science department at the University of Buffalo. His PhD was in 1986 from Oxford University and it was titled <i>On the separation of complexity classes</i>. He was the PhD student of Dominic Welsh who was a student of John Hammersley.</p>
<p>Today I would like to wish Ken a happy birthday.</p>
<p>He is now 61 years young. I hope you will join me and wish him many more birthdays. His age is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/61_(number)">special</a> for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a twin prime.</li>
<li>It is equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%5E%7B2%7D+%2B+6%5E%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{5^{2} + 6^{2}}" class="latex" title="{5^{2} + 6^{2}}" />.</li>
<li>It is the ninth Mersenne prime: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7B61%7D+-+1+%3D+2%2C305%2C843%2C009%2C213%2C693%2C951%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^{61} - 1 = 2,305,843,009,213,693,951}" class="latex" title="{2^{61} - 1 = 2,305,843,009,213,693,951}" />.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three big <b>I’s</b> in his life. Let’s talk about two of them.</p>
<h2>Interest in Cricket</h2>
<p>Ken loves sports in general and especially cricket. Last Sunday he told me he watched his Bills win their first NFL game while he watched a cricket match. I have no idea how cricket works, but here is Ken’s <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/Writing/CricketBaseball.html">explanation</a>: <i>Are Cricket and Baseball sister games?</i></p>

<h2>Interest in Chess</h2>
<p>When the chess world wants to know if someone has cheated, they call Ken. He is an international chess master, and has worked on stopping cheating for years. It is important these days, since most tournaments are now online. And cheating is easier when no one is directly able to watch you. Ken is busy.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the cheating problem. Suppose that Alice and Bob are playing an online game of chess. Alice makes her own moves, but she wonders if Bob could be cheating. He could be using advice from another “player”, Sally. There are several points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sally is a stronger player than anyone—she can easily beat Alice and Bob.</li>
<li>Sally not only says “here is my move”—she will sometimes give several good moves.</li>
<li>Sally is a program that is deterministic—given a position she gives the same answer.The issue for Ken is: When Alice played Bob did Bob make the moves or did he consult Sally?
</li></ol>
<p>There are many complexities:</p>
<ol>
<li>What if Bob agreed with all Sally’s moves? Then he certainly did cheat.</li>
<li>What if Bob was just lucky and played above his strength? Then he did not cheat.</li>
<li>What if Bob used Sally for some positions but not others? Then he did cheat, but it may be hard to be sure.</li>
<li>And so on.</li>
</ol>
<p>What Ken has done is create both a theory and programs to determine whether Bob did indeed cheat. I find the general problem of telling if one cheats online at chess to be fascinating. See us <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/06/18/the-problem-of-catching-chess-cheaters/">before</a> for more details and also see <a href="http://www.uschess.org/index.php/June/How-To-Catch-A-Chess-Cheater-Ken-Regan-Finds-Moves-Out-Of-Mind.html">this</a>.</p>

<p>Ken is one of the nicest people I know. Hope he has many more birthdays and many more twin primes.</p>

designed to interact with users during a certain activity, such as browsing,
chatting, socializing, emailing, driving, etc. The economic and incentive
structure of this exchange, as well as its algorithmic nature, have not been
explored to our knowledge; we initiate their study in this paper. We model this
interaction as a Stackelberg game between a Designer and one or more Agents. We
model an Agent as a Markov chain whose states are activities; we assume that
the Agent's utility is a linear function of the steady-state distribution of
this chain. The Designer may design a platform for each of these
activities/states; if a platform is adopted by the Agent, the transition
probabilities of the Markov chain are affected, and so is the objective of the
Agent. The Designer's utility is a linear function of the steady state
probabilities of the accessible states (that is, the ones for which the
platform has been adopted), minus the development cost of the platforms. The
underlying optimization problem of the Agent -- that is, how to choose the
states for which to adopt the platform -- is an MDP. If this MDP has a simple
yet plausible structure (the transition probabilities from one state to another
only depend on the target state and the recurrent probability of the current
state) the Agent's problem can be solved by a greedy algorithm. The Designer's
optimization problem (designing a custom suite for the Agent so as to optimize,
through the Agent's optimum reaction, the Designer's revenue), while NP-hard,
has an FPTAS. These results generalize, under mild additional assumptions, from
a single Agent to a distribution of Agents with finite support. The Designer's
optimization problem has abysmal "price of robustness", suggesting that
learning the parameters of the problem is crucial for the Designer.

information-computation gaps in high-dimensional statistical estimation
problems. A prominent approach is to characterize the limits of restricted
models of computation, which on the one hand yields strong computational lower
bounds for powerful classes of algorithms and on the other hand helps guide the
development of efficient algorithms. In this paper, we study two of the most
popular restricted computational models, the statistical query framework and
low-degree polynomials, in the context of high-dimensional hypothesis testing.
Our main result is that under mild conditions on the testing problem, the two
classes of algorithms are essentially equivalent in power. As corollaries, we
obtain new statistical query lower bounds for sparse PCA, tensor PCA and
several variants of the planted clique problem.

$\mathit{maximum~weight~bipartite~matching}$ problem is to find a set of
vertex-disjoint edges with the maximum weight. This classic problem has been
extensively studied for over a century.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we present a new streaming algorithm for the maximum weight
bipartite matching problem that uses $\widetilde{O}(n)$ space and
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{m})$ passes, which breaks the $n$-pass barrier. All the
previous algorithms either require $\Omega(n \log n)$ passes or only find an
approximate solution.
</p>
<p>To achieve this pass bound, our algorithm combines a number of techniques
from different fields such as the interior point method (IPM), symmetric
diagonally dominant (SDD) system solving, the isolation lemma, and LP duality.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that implements the SDD
solver and IPM in the streaming model in $\widetilde{O}(n)$ spaces for graph
matrix. All the previous IPMs only focus on optimizing the running time,
regardless of the space usage. The LP solver for general matrix is impossible
to be implemented in $\widetilde{O}(n)$ spaces.

graph, to quickly report a minimum-weight cut that separates a query pair of
nodes $s,t$. The best data structure known for this problem simply builds a
cut-equivalent tree, discovered 60 years ago by Gomory and Hu, who also showed
how to construct it using $n-1$ minimum $st$-cut computations. Using
state-of-the-art algorithms for minimum $st$-cut (Lee and Sidford, FOCS 2014)
<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1312.6713">arXiv:1312.6713</a>, one can construct the tree in time $\tilde{O}(mn^{3/2})$,
which is also the preprocessing time of the data structure. (Throughout, we
focus on polynomially-bounded edge weights, noting that faster algorithms are
known for small/unit edge weights.)
</p>
<p>Our main result shows the following equivalence: Cut-equivalent trees can be
constructed in near-linear time if and only if there is a data structure for
Min-Cut queries with near-linear preprocessing time and polylogarithmic
(amortized) query time, and even if the queries are restricted to a fixed
source. That is, equivalent trees are an essentially optimal solution for
Min-Cut queries. This equivalence holds even for every minor-closed family of
graphs, such as bounded-treewidth graphs, for which a two-decade old data
structure (Arikati et al., J.~Algorithms 1998) implies the first near-linear
time construction of cut-equivalent trees.
</p>
<p>Moreover, unlike all previous techniques for constructing cut-equivalent
trees, ours is robust to relying on approximation algorithms. In particular,
using the almost-linear time algorithm for $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate minimum
$st$-cut (Kelner et al., SODA 2014), we can construct a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate flow-equivalent tree (which is a slightly weaker
notion) in time $n^{2+o(1)}$. This leads to the first
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation for All-Pairs Max-Flow that runs in time
$n^{2+o(1)}$, and matches the output size almost-optimally.

problems is a prominent area of research in computer science. Likewise, the
study of NP-Complete problems lies at the heart of computer science with
numerous results in algorithms and complexity. In this paper we raise the
question of computing fault tolerant solutions to NP-Complete problems; that is
computing a solution that can survive the "failure" of a few constituent
elements. This notion has appeared in a variety of theoretical and practical
settings such as estimating network reliability, kernelization (aka instance
compression), approximation algorithms and so on. In this paper, we seek to
highlight these questions for further research.
</p>
<p>As a concrete example, we study the fault-tolerant version of the classical
Feedback Vertex Set (FVS) problem, that we call Fault Tolerant Feedback Vertex
Set (FT-FVS). Recall that, in FVS the input is a graph $G$ and the objective is
to compute a minimum subset of vertices $S$ such that $G-S$ is a forest. In
FT-FVS, the objective is to compute a minimum subset $S$ of vertices such that
$G - (S \setminus \{v\})$ is a forest for any $v \in V(G)$. Here the vertex $v$
denotes a single vertex fault. We show that this problem is NP-Complete, and
then present a constant factor approximation algorithm as well as an
FPT-algorithm parameterized by the solution size. We believe that the question
of computing fault tolerant solutions to various NP-Complete problems is an
interesting direction for future research.

coloring problems in the CONGESTED CLIQUE model by presenting a simple
deterministic algorithm for both problems running in a constant number of
rounds. This matches the complexity of the recent breakthrough randomized
constant-round $(\Delta+1)$-list coloring algorithm due to Chang et al.
(PODC'19), and significantly improves upon the state-of-the-art $O(\log
\Delta)$-round deterministic $(\Delta+1)$-coloring bound of Parter (ICALP'18).
</p>
<p>A remarkable property of our algorithm is its simplicity. Whereas the
state-of-the-art randomized algorithms for this problem are based on the quite
involved local coloring algorithm of Chang et al. (STOC'18), our algorithm can
be described in just a few lines. At a high level, it applies a careful
derandomization of a recursive procedure which partitions the nodes and their
respective palettes into separate bins. We show that after $O(1)$ recursion
steps, the remaining uncolored subgraph within each bin has linear size, and
thus can be solved locally by collecting it to a single node. This algorithm
can also be implemented in the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model
provided that each machine has linear (in $n$, the number of nodes in the input
graph) space.
</p>
<p>We also show an extension of our algorithm to the MPC regime in which
machines have sublinear space: we present the first deterministic
$(\Delta+1)$-list coloring algorithm designed for sublinear-space MPC, which
runs in $O(\log \Delta + \log\log n)$ rounds.

solutions. In practice, single or multiple objectives must be satisfied,
wherein both the objective function and constraints can be non-convex resulting
in multiple optimal solutions. Real world scenarios include intersecting
surfaces as Implicit Functions, Hyperspectral Unmixing and Pareto Optimal
fronts. Local or global convexification is a common workaround when faced with
non-convex forms. However, such an approach is often restricted to a strict
class of functions, deviation from which results in sub-optimal solution to the
original problem. We present neural solutions for extracting optimal sets as
approximate manifolds, where unmodified, non-convex objectives and constraints
are defined as modeler guided, domain-informed $L_2$ loss function. This
promotes interpretability since modelers can confirm the results against known
analytical forms in their specific domains. We present synthetic and realistic
cases to validate our approach and compare against known solvers for
bench-marking in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

stable solutions. However, in many important societal problems, the degree of
fairness in the matching assumes crucial importance, for instance when we have
to match COVID-19 patients to care units. We study the problem of finding a
stable many-to-one matching while satisfying fairness among all the agents with
cardinal utilities. We consider various fairness definitions from fair
allocation literature, such as envy-freeness (EF) and leximin optimal fairness.
We find that EF and its weaker versions are incompatible with stability, even
under a restricted setting with isometric utilities. We focus on leximin
optimal fairness and show that finding such a matching is NP-Hard, even under
isometric utilities. Next, we narrow our focus onto ranked isometric utilities
and provide a characterisation for the space of stable matchings. We present a
novel and efficient algorithm that finds the leximin optimal stable matching
under ranked isometric utilities. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to address the problem of finding a leximin optimally fair and stable
matching.

Given a finite undirected
(network) graph $G$, a set of sources $I \subseteq G$ initiate flooding in the
first round by every node in $I$ sending the same message to all of its
neighbours. In each subsequent round, nodes send the message to all of their
neighbours from which they did not receive the message in the previous round.
Flooding terminates when no node in $G$ sends a message in a round. The
question of termination has not been settled - rather, non-termination is
implicitly assumed to be possible.
</p>
<p>We show that flooding terminates on every finite graph. In the case of a
single source $g_0$, flooding terminates in $e$ rounds if $G$ is bipartite and
$j$ rounds with $e &lt; j \leq e+d+1$ otherwise, where $e$ and $d$ are the
eccentricity of $g_0$ and diameter of $G$ respectively. For
communication/broadcast to all nodes, this is asymptotically time optimal and
obviates the need for construction and maintenance of spanning structures. We
extend to dynamic flooding initiated in multiple rounds with possibly multiple
messages. The cases where a node only sends a message to neighbours from which
it did not receive {\it any} message in the previous round, and where a node
sends some highest ranked message to all neighbours from which it did not
receive {\it that} message in the previous round, both terminate. All these
cases also hold if the network graph loses edges over time. Non-terminating
cases include asynchronous flooding, flooding where messages have fixed delays
at edges, cases of multiple-message flooding and cases where the network graph
acquires edges over time.

the capacitated single-item lot sizing problem with backordering under demand
uncertainty, modeled by uncertain cumulative demands. The well-known interval
budgeted uncertainty representation is assumed. Two of its variants are
considered. The first one is the discrete budgeted uncertainty, in which at
most a specified number of cumulative demands can deviate from their nominal
values at the same time.The second variant is the continuous budgeted
uncertainty, in which the sum of the deviations of cumulative demands from
their nominal values, at the same time, is at most a bound on the total
deviation provided. For both cases, in order to choose a production plan that
hedges against the cumulative demand uncertainty, the robust minmax criterion
is used. Polynomial algorithms for evaluating the impact of uncertainty in the
demand on a given production plan in terms of its cost, called the adversarial
problem, and for finding robust production plans under the discrete budgeted
uncertainty are constructed. Hence, in this case, the problems under
consideration are not much computationally harder than their deterministic
counterparts. For the continuous budgeted uncertainty, it is shown that the
adversarial problem and the problem of computing a robust production plan along
with its worst-case cost are NP-hard. In the case, when uncertainty intervals
are non-overlapping, they can be solved in pseudopolynomial time and admit
fully polynomial timeapproximation schemes. In the general case, a
decomposition algorithm for finding a robust plan is proposed.

information theory measuring the rate of growth of independent sets in graph
powers. Despite being well-studied, this quantity continues to hold several
mysteries. Lov\'asz famously proved that the Shannon capacity of $C_5$ (the
5-cycle) is at most $\sqrt{5}$ via his theta function. This bound is achieved
by a simple linear code over $\mathbb{F}_5$ mapping $x \mapsto 2x$. Motivated
by this, we introduce the notion of $\textit{linear Shannon capacity}$ of
graphs, which is the largest rate achievable when restricting oneself to linear
codes. We give a simple proof based on the polynomial method that the linear
Shannon capacity of $C_5$ is $\sqrt{5}$. Our method applies more generally to
Cayley graphs over the additive group of finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$. We
compare our bound to the Lov\'asz theta function, showing that they match for
self-complementary Cayley graphs (such as $C_5$), and that our bound is smaller
in some cases. We also exhibit a quadratic gap between linear and general
Shannon capacity for some graphs.

Consider the problem of computing the majority of a stream of $n$ i.i.d. uniformly random bits. This problem, known as the {\it coin problem}, is central to a number of counting problems in different data stream models. We show that any streaming algorithm for solving this problem with large constant advantage must use $\Omega(\log n)$ bits of space. We extend our lower bound to proving tight lower bounds for solving multiple, randomly interleaved copies of the coin problem, as well as for solving the OR of multiple copies of a variant of the coin problem. Our proofs involve new measures of information complexity that are well-suited for data streams. 

We use these lower bounds to obtain a number of new results for data streams. In each case there is an underlying $d$-dimensional vector $x$ with additive updates to its coordinates given in a stream of length $m$. The input streams arising from our coin lower bound have nice distributional properties, and consequently for many problems for which we only had lower bounds in general turnstile streams, we now obtain the same lower bounds in more natural models, such as the bounded deletion model, in which $\|x\|_2$ never drops by a constant fraction of what it was earlier, or in the random order model, in which the updates are ordered randomly. In particular, in the bounded deletion model, we obtain nearly tight lower bounds for approximating $\|x\|_{\infty}$ up to additive error $\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} \|x\|_2$, approximating $\|x\|_2$ up to a multiplicative $(1 + \epsilon)$ factor (resolving a question of Jayaram and Woodruff in PODS 2018), and solving the Point Query and $\ell_2$-Heavy Hitters Problems. In the random order model, we also obtain new lower bounds for the Point Query and $\ell_2$-Heavy Hitters Problems. 
We also give new algorithms complementing our lower bounds and illustrating the tightness of the models we consider, including an algorithm for approximating $\|x\|_{\infty}$ up to additive error $\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} \|x\|_2$ in turnstile streams (resolving a question of Cormode in a 2006 IITK Workshop), and an algorithm for finding $\ell_2$-heavy hitters in randomly ordered insertion streams (which for random order streams, resolves a question of Nelson in a 2018 Warwick Workshop).</div>

as it provides a general framework for solving the important iterative search
problem. In the problem, the input is a graph $G$ with constant degree and a
set of values for every vertex of $G$. The goal is to preprocess $G$ such that
when given a query value $q$, and a connected subgraph $\pi$ of $G$, we can
find the predecessor of $q$ in all the sets associated with the vertices of
$\pi$. The fundamental result of fractional cascading is that there exists a
data structure that uses linear space and it can answer queries in $O(\log n +
|\pi|)$ time [Chazelle and Guibas, 1986]. While this technique has received
plenty of attention in the past decades, an almost quadratic space lower bound
for "2D fractional cascading" [Chazelle and Liu, 2001] has convinced the
researchers that fractional cascading is fundamentally a 1D technique.
</p>
<p>In 2D fractional cascading, the input includes a planar subdivision for every
vertex of $G$ and the query is a point $q$ and a subgraph $\pi$ and the goal is
to locate the cell containing $q$ in all the subdivisions associated with the
vertices of $\pi$. In this paper, we show that it is possible to circumvent the
lower bound of Chazelle and Liu for axis-aligned planar subdivisions. We
present a number of upper and lower bounds which reveal that in 2D, the problem
has a much richer structure. When $G$ is a tree and $\pi$ is a path, then
queries can be answered in
$O(\log{n}+|\pi|+\min\{|\pi|\sqrt{\log{n}},\alpha(n)\sqrt{|\pi|}\log{n}\})$
time using linear space where $\alpha$ is an inverse Ackermann function;
surprisingly, we show both branches of this bound are tight, up to the inverse
Ackermann factor. When $G$ is a general graph or when $\pi$ is a general
subgraph, then the query bound becomes $O(\log n + |\pi|\sqrt{\log n})$ and
this bound is once again tight in both cases.

models assume a uniform fault model. Such a model assumes that every subset of
the network resources (edges or vertices) of a given cardinality $k$ may fail.
While this approach yields problems with clean combinatorial structure and good
algorithms, it often fails to capture the true nature of the scenario set
coming from applications. One natural refinement of the uniform model is
obtained by partitioning the set of resources into vulnerable and safe
resources. The scenario set contains every subset of at most $k$ faulty
resources. This work studies the Fault-Tolerant Path (FTP) problem, the
counterpart of the Shortest Path problem in this fault model and the
Fault-Tolerant Flow problem (FTF), the counterpart of the $\ell$-disjoint
Shortest $s$-$t$ Path problem. We present complexity results alongside exact
and approximation algorithms for both models. We emphasize the vast increase in
the complexity of the problem with respect to the uniform analogue, the
Edge-Disjoint Paths problem.

<p><b>Authors: </b>Thom Fruehwirth <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05314">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>Repeated recursion unfolding is a new approach that repeatedly unfolds a
recursion with itself and simplifies it while keeping all unfolded rules. Each
unfolding doubles the number of recursive steps covered. This reduces the
number of recursive rule applications to its logarithm at the expense of
introducing a logarithmic number of unfolded rules to the program. Efficiency
crucially depends on the amount of simplification inside the unfolded rules. We
prove a super-linear speedup theorem in the best case, i.e. speedup by more
than a constant factor. Our optimization can lower the time complexity class of
a program. In this paper, the super-linear speedup is within bounds: it holds
up to an arbitrary but chosen upper bound on the number of recursive steps. We
also report on the first results with a prototype implementation of repeated
recursion unfolding. A simple program transformation completely removes
recursion up to the chosen bound. The actual runtime improvement quickly
reaches several orders of magnitude.

$O(\sqrt{\log n})$ levels of the Sum-of-Squares hierarchy. In contrast to
earlier constructions, which involve a random component, our systems can be
constructed explicitly in deterministic polynomial time.
</p>
<p>Our construction is based on the high-dimensional expanders devised by
Lubotzky, Samuels and Vishne, known as LSV complexes or Ramanujan complexes,
and our analysis is based on two notions of expansion for these complexes:
cosystolic expansion, and a local isoperimetric inequality due to Gromov.
</p>
<p>Our construction offers an interesting contrast to the recent work of Alev,
Jeronimo and the last author~(FOCS 2019). They showed that 3XOR instances in
which the variables correspond to vertices in a high-dimensional expander are
easy to solve. In contrast, in our instances the variables correspond to the
edges of the complex.

Nisheeth Vishnoi is a professor at Yale University in the computer science department. The faculty <a href="https://cpsc.yale.edu/people/faculty">there</a> is impressive and includes many of the top researchers in the world. The CS faculty is pretty good too. As Nisheeth’s PhD advisor, years ago, I am proud that he is at Yale. </p>
<p>
Today I wish to discuss a new book by Nisheeth. </p>
<p>
The title is <a href="https://convex-optimization.github.io/ACO-v1.pdf">Algorithms for Convex Optimization</a>. Let me jump ahead and say that I like the book and especially this insight: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>One way to solve discrete problems is to apply continuous methods.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not a new insight, but is an important one. Continuous math is older than discrete and often is more powerful. Some examples of this are:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" title="{\bullet}" /> Analytic number theory is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_number_theory">based</a> on the behavior of continuous functions. Some of the deepest theorems on prime numbers use such methods. Think of the Riemann zeta function 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Czeta%28s%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%5Cinfty+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%5Es%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B1%5Es%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%5Es%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%5Es%7D+%2B+%5Ccdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s} = \frac{1}{1^s} + \frac{1}{2^s} + \frac{1}{3^s} + \cdots " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s} = \frac{1}{1^s} + \frac{1}{2^s} + \frac{1}{3^s} + \cdots " /></p>
<p>as a function of complex numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{s}" class="latex" title="{s}" />.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" title="{\bullet}" /> Additive number theory is <a href="https://encyclopediaofmath.org/wiki/Additive_number_theory">based</a> on the behavior of continuous functions. Think of generating functions and Fourier methods. </p>
<p>
The power of continuous methods is one that I sometimes forget. Nisheeth’s book is a testament to the power of this idea. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Convexity </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Nisheeth’s book uses another fundamental idea from complexity theory. This is: restrict problems in some way. Allowing too large a class usually makes complexity high. For example, trees are easier in general than planar graphs, and sparse graphs are easier than general graphs. Of course “in general” must be controlled, but restricting the problem types does often reduce complexity. </p>
<p>
Convexity adds to this tradition since <em>convex</em> generalizes the notion of <em>linear</em>. And convex problems of all kinds are abundant in practice, abundant in theory, and are important.</p>

Here is a passage by Roman Dwilewicz on the <a href="http://www.mathem.pub.ro/dgds/v11/D11-DW.pdf">history</a> of the convexity concept:</p>

<p>It seems that the first more rigorous definition of convexity was given by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes">Archimedes</a> of Syracuse, (ca 287 – ca 212 B.C.) in his treatise: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Sphere_and_Cylinder">On the sphere and cylinder</a>. </p>

Nisheeth’s book is now available at this <a href="https://convex-optimization.github.io">site</a>. I have just started to examine it and must say I like the book. Okay, I am not an expert on convex algorithms, nor am I an expert on this type of geometric theory. But I definitely like his viewpoint. Let me explain in a moment. </p>

</p><p></p><h2> Discrete vs Continuous Methods </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Nisheeth in his introduction explains how continuous methods help in many combinatorial problems, like finding flows on graphs. He uses the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{s}" class="latex" title="{s}" />—<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> flow problem as his example. The <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{s}" class="latex" title="{s}" />—<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" />-maximum flow problem arises in real-world scheduling problems, but is also a fundamental combinatorial problem that can be used to find a maximum matching in a bipartite graph, for example.</p>

<i>Combinatorial algorithms for the maximum flow problem</i>. He points out that by building on the Ford-Fulkerson method, various polynomial-time results were proved and other bounds were improved. But he states that the <i>improvements stopped in 1998.</i> Discrete methods seem to be unable to improve complexity for flow problems. </p>
<p>
<i>Convex programming-based algorithms</i>. He adds: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Starting with the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.2921.pdf">paper</a> by Paul Christiano, Jonathan Kelner, Aleksander Mądry, Daniel Spielman, Shang-Hua Teng<br />
the last decade has seen striking progress on the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{s}" class="latex" title="{s}" />–<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> maximum flow problem. One of the keys to this success has been to abandon combinatorial approaches and view the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{s}" class="latex" title="{s}" />–<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> maximum flow problem through the lens of continuous optimization.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>
Thus, at this point it may seem like we are heading in the wrong direction. We started off with a combinatorial problem that is a special type of a linear programming problem, and here we are with a nonlinear optimization formulation for it. Thus the questions arise: which formulation should we chose? and, why should this convex optimization approach lead us to faster algorithms? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Take a look at Nisheeth’s <a href="https://convex-optimization.github.io">site</a> for the answers.</p>
<p>
I wish I were better informed about continuous methods in general. They are powerful and pretty. Maybe I could solve an open problem that I have thought about if I knew this material better. Hmmm. Maybe it will help you solve some open problem of your own. Take a look at his book.</p>

We prove that the Impagliazzo-Nisan-Wigderson (STOC 1994) pseudorandom generator (PRG) fools ordered (read-once) permutation branching programs of unbounded width with a seed length of $\widetilde{O}(\log d + \log n \cdot \log(1/\varepsilon))$, assuming the program has only one accepting vertex in the final layer. Here, $n$ is the length of the program, $d$ is the degree (equivalently, the alphabet size), and $\varepsilon$ is the error of the PRG. In contrast, we show that a randomly chosen generator requires seed length $\Omega(n \log d)$ to fool such unbounded-width programs. Thus, this is an unusual case where an explicit construction is "better than random."

Except when the program's width $w$ is very small, this is an improvement over prior work. For example, when $w = \text{poly}(n)$ and d = 2, the best prior PRG for permutation branching programs was simply Nisan's PRG (Combinatorica 1992), which fools general ordered branching programs with seed length $O(\log(wn/\varepsilon) \log n)$. We prove a seed length lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}(\log d + \log n \cdot \log(1/\varepsilon))$ for fooling these unbounded-width programs, showing that our seed length is near-optimal. In fact, when $\varepsilon \leq 1 / \log n$, our seed length is within a constant factor of optimal. Our analysis of the INW generator uses the connection between the PRG and the derandomized square of Rozenman and Vadhan (RANDOM 2005) and the recent analysis of the latter in terms of unit-circle approximation by Ahmadinejad et al. (FOCS 2020).</div>

The field of Interactive Coding studies how an interactive protocol can be made resilient to channel errors. Even though this field has received abundant attention since Schulman's seminal paper (FOCS 92), constructing interactive coding schemes that are both deterministic and efficient, and at the same time resilient to adversarial errors (with constant information and error rates), remains an elusive open problem.

An appealing approach towards resolving this problem is to show efficiently encodable and decodable constructions of a combinatorial object called tree codes (Schulman, STOC 93). After a lot of effort in this direction, the current state of the art has deterministic constructions of tree codes that are efficiently encodable but require a logarithmic (instead of constant) alphabet (Cohen, Haeupler, and Schulman, STOC 18). However, we still lack (even heuristic) candidate constructions that are efficiently decodable. 

In this work, we show that tree codes that are efficiently encodable, {\em but not efficiently decodable}, also imply deterministic and efficient interactive coding schemes that are resilient to adversarial errors. Our result immediately implies a deterministic and efficient interactive coding scheme with a logarithmic alphabet (i.e., $1/\log \log$ rate). We show this result using a novel implementation of hashing through deterministic tree codes that is powerful enough to yield interactive coding schemes.</div>

We construct an explicit family of 3XOR instances which is hard for Omega(sqrt(log n)) levels of the Sum-of-Squares hierarchy. In contrast to earlier constructions, which involve a random component, our systems can be constructed explicitly in deterministic polynomial time.
Our construction is based on the high-dimensional expanders devised by Lubotzky, Samuels and Vishne, known as LSV complexes or Ramanujan complexes, and our analysis is based on two notions of expansion for these complexes: cosystolic expansion, and a local isoperimetric inequality due to Gromov.
Our construction offers an interesting contrast to the recent work of Alev, Jeronimo and the last author (FOCS 2019). They showed that 3XOR instances in which the variables correspond to vertices in a high-dimensional expander are easy to solve. In contrast, in our instances the variables correspond to the edges of the complex.</div>

<p>
Moshe Vardi holds multiple professorships at Rice University. He is also the Senior Editor of <em>Communications of the ACM</em>. His is therefore a voice to be reckoned with in the current debate over how best to teach during the pandemic. Much of the debate is over whether all should hear his voice the same way, or some hear it in the classroom while others hear it remotely. </p>
<p>
Today we note his recent <a href="https://medium.com/@vardi/covid-19-the-ford-pinto-and-american-higher-ed-2b191920b065">column</a> for <em>Medium</em> advocating the former. Then I (Ken) give some of my own impressions.</p>
<p>
His September 5 column followed an August 8 <a href="https://www.ricethresher.org/article/2020/08/return-to-campus-but-to-what-end">opinion</a> given to the Rice student newspaper. Both begin with concern over the conflict between <em>safety</em> and <em>value</em> for students. Much of the value of college—<em>most</em> according to statistics he cites—comes from being collegial: outside the classroom. But many such activities, not only evening parties but informal games and gatherings, are the most unsafe. </p>
<p>
We will focus however on what Moshe says about the nature of instruction for lecture courses. Certainly for laboratory courses there is a sharp trade-off between safety and in-person interaction. But we focus here on what he says about the nature of teaching in the lecture hall, where one can take safety as a given requirement. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> An In-Person Remoteness Paradox </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I have just returned from sabbatical at the University at Buffalo (UB) and am teaching this fall a small elective 4xx/5xx theory course. It has 15 students, smaller than the 25 in the hypothetical class Moshe describes but of the same order of magnitude. In the spring I will be teaching a larger undergraduate course which is also on target for his concerns. I have taught such a class every spring for a decade. While this assignment is not a new to me, the issue of safety raises tough choices about the delivery options. My options are: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<em>remote-only</em>; <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>in-person only</em>; <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>hybrid</em> use of 1 and 2 for designated course components; <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>hybrid-flexible</em>, meaning 1 and 2 are conducted simultaneously with students free to choose either option, even on a per-lecture basis.
</li></ol>
<p>
I have committed to hybrid-flexible. For my current fall course, I made this commitment in early summer when there was uncertainty over in-person instruction requirements for student visas and registration. I believe that my larger course will be implemented as safely in a large room as my current course. The question is quality.</p>
<p>
Moshe notes right away a paradox for his hypothetical class that could apply to any of modes 2–4; to include the last expressly, I’ve inserted the word “even”:</p>
<blockquote><p> <em> …I realized that [even] the students <b>in the classroom</b> will have to be communicating with me on Zoom, to be heard and recorded. All this, while both the students and I are wearing face masks. It dawned on me then that I will be conducting remote teaching <b>in the classroom</b>. </em>
</p></blockquote>

<p>
In fact, I have one volunteer now in the room logging into Zoom to help with interaction from those attending remotely. This helps because my podium has less space to catch faces and detect questions right away. I do repeat questions so they are picked up in the recording and often redirect them to the class. Still, the mere fact of my not seeing faces alongside the notes and interactive drawings I am sharing makes me feel Moshe’s paradox all the time. This is even though my room allows denser spacing than at Rice, so a class of 25 could sit closer.  Let me, however, say why I love stand-up teaching before addressing his paramount question of what is best for the students at this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> From Whiteboards to Tutorials </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Dick once wrote a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/11/07/in-praise-of-chalk-talks/">post</a>, “In Praise of Chalk Talks.” First, with reference to talks pre-made using PowerPoint or LaTeX slides, Dick wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Such talks can be informative and easy to follow, yet sometimes PowerPoint is not well suited to giving a proof. The slides do not hold enough <b>state</b> for us to easily follow the argument. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Moreover, when I contributed to the open-problems session of the workshop at IAS in Princeton, NJ that we <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/06/06/princeton-is-invariant/">covered</a> two years ago, Avi Wigderson insisted that everyone use chalk, not slides. I’ve used slides for UB’s data-structures and programming languages courses, but I think students benefit from seeing proofs and problem-solving ideas <em>grow</em>.</p>
<p>
I find furthermore that the feel of immersion in a process of discovery is enhanced by an in-person presence. I had this in mind when I followed Dick’s post with a long one <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/11/15/the-graph-of-math/">imagining</a> Kurt Gödel expounding the distinctive points of his set theory (joint with Paul Bernays and John von Neumann), all on one chalkboard. My classes are not as interactive as in that post, but I prepare junctures in lectures for posing questions and doing a little bit of Socratic method. And I try to lead this with body language as well as voice inflection, whether at a whiteboard or drawing on hard paper via a document camera. </p>
<p>
Still, it exactly this “extra” that gets diminished for those who are remote. When I share my screen for notes or a drawing (both in <a href="https://www.mathcha.io/">MathCha</a>), they see my movements only in a small second window if at all. They do hear my voice—but I do not hear theirs even if they unmute themselves. Nor can I read their state of following as I do in the room. Without reiterating the safety factor as Moshe does, I can reformulate his key question as:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Does the non-uniformity and inequality of hybrid delivery outweigh the benefits of making in-person instruction available to some? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
I must quickly add that in-person teaching is perceived as a collective need at UB. The web form I filled for Spring 2021 stated that some in-person classes must be available at all levels, 1xx through 7xx. I am happy to oblige. But the fact that I chose a flexible structure, especially in a small class, does allow the students to give opinion on this question, as well as on something Moshe says next:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Remote teaching” actually can do a better job of reproducing the intimacy that we take for granted in small classes. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Toward this end, I am implementing a remote version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutorial_system">tutorial system</a> I was part of for two eight-week terms at Oxford while a junior fellow of Merton College. When Cambridge University <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/education-52732814">declared</a> already last May that there would be no in-person lectures all the way through summer 2021, this is because most lectures there are formally optional anyway. The heart of required teaching is via weekly tutorial hours in groups of one-to-three students. They are organized separately by each of thirty-plus constituent colleges rather than by department-centered staff, so the numbers are divided to be manageable. In my math-course tutorials the expectation was for each student to present a solved problem and participate in discussions that build on the methods. </p>
<p>
I am doing this every other week this fall, alternating with weeks of problem-set review that will be strictly optional and classed as enhanced office hours. All UB office hours must be remote anyway. The tutorial requirement was agreed by student voice-vote in a tradeoff with lowering the material in timed exams to compensate for differences in home situations. After a few weeks of this, the class will take stock for opinions on which delivery options work best. UB has already committed to being remote-only after Thanksgiving, and it is possible that the on-campus medical situation will trigger an earlier conversion anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We would like to throw the floor open for comment on Moshe’s matters that we’ve highlighted and on his other opinions about the university mission amid the current crisis more generally. </p>
<p>
[edited to reflect that at Rice too, the hypothetical class could be in any of modes 2–4, and that spacing is further than in my UB room.  “Princeton IAS” -&gt; “IAS in Princeton, NJ”]</p></font></font></div>

The graph isomorphism distance between two graphs $G_u$ and $G_k$ is the fraction of entries in the adjacency matrix that has to be changed to make $G_u$ isomorphic to $G_k$. We study the problem of estimating, up to a constant additive factor, the graph isomorphism distance between two graphs in the query model. In other words, if $G_k$ is a known graph and $G_u$ is an unknown graph whose adjacency matrix has to be accessed by querying the entries, what is the query complexity for testing whether the graph isomorphism distance between $G_u$ and $G_k$ is less than $\gamma_1$ or more than $\gamma_2$, where $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ are two constants with $0\leq \gamma_1 &lt; \gamma_2 \leq 1$. It is also called the tolerant property testing of graph isomorphism in the dense graph model. The non-tolerant version (where $\gamma_1$ is $0$) has been studied by Fischer and Matsliah (SICOMP'08). 


In this paper, we study both the upper and lower bounds of tolerant graph isomorphism testing. We prove an upper bound of $\widetilde{{\cal O}}(n)$ for this problem. Our upper bound algorithm crucially uses the tolerant testing of the well studied Earth Mover Distance (EMD), as the main subroutine, in a slightly different setting from what is generally studied in property testing literature.


Testing tolerant EMD between two probability distributions is equivalent to testing EMD between two multi-sets, where the multiplicity of each element is taken appropriately, and we sample elements from the unknown multi-set with replacement. In this paper, our (main conceptual) contribution is to introduce the problem of tolerant EMD testing between multi-sets (over Hamming cube) when we get samples from the unknown multi-set without replacement and to show that this variant of tolerant testing of EMD is as hard as tolerant testing of graph isomorphism between two graphs. Thus, while testing of equivalence between distributions is at the heart of the non-tolerant testing of graph isomorphism, we are showing that the estimation of the EMD over a Hamming cube (when we are allowed to sample without replacement) is at the heart of 
tolerant graph isomorphism. We believe that the introduction of the problem of testing EMD between multi-sets (when we get samples without replacement) opens an entirely new direction in the world of testing properties of distributions.</div>

<p>Last month saw action in property testing across the board: graphs, distributions and functions were all objects of study in papers that came out last month. Also included is a separation result between quantum and classical query complexities resolving a conjecture of Aaronson and Ambainis. Here is a brief report.</p>



<p><strong>Testing asymmetry in bounded degree graphs</strong>, by Oded Goldreich (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/118/">ECCC</a>). This paper studies a natural graph property hitherto not considered in the property testing literature. Namely, the question of testing whether a graph is <em>asymmetric</em> or whether it is far from being asymmetric. A graph is said to be asymmetric if its automorphism group is trivial (that is, it only contains the identity permutation). One of the results in the paper says that this problem is easy in the dense graph model – which is a side result of the paper. This is because all dense graphs are \(O(\log n/n)\)-close to being asymmetric. To see this, the paper points out that a simple randomized process which takes \(G\) as input and returns an asymmetric graph by changing very few edges. This process asks you to do the following: Take a set \(S \subseteq V\) with \(|S| = O(\log n)\) nodes and replace the subgraph they induce with a random graph. Moreover,  randomize all the edges between \(S\) and \(V \setminus S\). What you can show is that in this modified graph, any automorphism (whp) will map \(S\) to itself. And all the remaining vertices behave (whp) in a unique manner which is peculiar to it. In particular, this means that any automorphism better not map a vertex \(v\) in \(V \setminus S\) to any other vertex in \(V \setminus S\). And this finishes the argument. The main result explores the bounded degree model. By a simple argument, you can show that testing asymmetry is easy if all the connected components have size \(s(n) \leq o\left(\frac{\log n}{\log {\log n}}\right)\). Thus, the challenging case is when you have some connected components of a larger size. In this case, what Goldreich shows is the following: If all the components have size at most \(s(n)\) where \(s(n) \geq \Omega\left(\frac{\log n}{\log {\log n}}\right)\), then you can test asymmetry (with one-sided-error) in \(O(n^{1/2} \cdot s(n)/\epsilon)\) queries.  Moreover, the paper also shows a two-sided-lower bound of \(\Omega\left(n/s(n)\right)^{1/2}\) queries which holds as long as \(\epsilon \leq O(1/s(n)\). This leaves open the bounded degree question of determining the query complexity of testing asymmetry in the general case as the paper also points out.</p>

<p><strong>On testability of first order properties in Bounded degree graphs</strong>, by Isolde Adler, Noleen Köhler and Pan Peng (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.05800.pdf">arXiv</a>). One of the well understood motivations for property testing begins in the following manner. Decision problems are typically hard to solve if they involve a universal quantifier — either \(\exists\) or  \(\forall\). One way around this hardness is to do the following ritual: relax the problem by dropping the universal quantifier, define a notion of distance between objects in your universe and ask a promise problem instead. Indeed, if you take your favorite property testing problem, you will note that it precisely fits in the template above. How about making this business more rigorous in bounded degree graph property model? This is precisely the content of this work which considers the face off between (First Order) logic and property testing in the bounded degree model. The authors show some interesting results. They begin by showing that in the bounded degree model, you can show that all first order graph properties which involve a single quantifier \(Q \in \{\forall, \exists\}\) are testable with constant query complexity.<br />If you find this baffling, it would be good to remind yourself that not all graph properties can be expressed in the language of first order logic with a single quantifier! So, you can rest easy. The graph properties you know are not constant time testable are most assuredly not expressible with a single quantifier in First Order Logic. However, this work shows more. It turns out, that “any FO property that is defined by a formula with quantifier prefix \(\exists^* \forall^*\) is testable”. Moreover, there do exist FO graph properties defined by the quantifier prefix \(\forall^* \exists^*\) which are not testable. Thus, this work achieves results in the bounded degree model which are kind of analogous to the results in the dense graph model by Alon et al [1]. On a final note, I find the following one sentence summary of the techniques used to prove the lower bound rather intriguing: “[the paper] obtains the lower bound by a first-order formula that defines a class of bounded-degree expanders, based on zig-zag products of graphs.”  </p>

<p><strong>On graphs of bounded degree that are far from being Hamiltonian</strong>, by Isolde Adler and Noleen Köhler (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05801">arXiv</a>). This paper explores the question of testing Hamiltonicity in the bounded degree model. The main result of the paper is that Hamiltonicity is not testable with one-sided error with \(o(n)\) queries. PTReview readers might recall from our <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/?p=1371">July Post</a> a concurrent paper by Goldriech [2] which achieves the same lower bound on query complexity in the two-sided error model (the authors call attention to [2] as well). One of the interesting feature of this result is that the lower bounds are obtained by an explicit deterministic reduction as opposed to the usual randomized reduction. Like the authors point out, this offers more insights into structural complexity of instances that are far from being Hamiltonian. We point out that this also differs from how the lower bound is derived in [2] — which is via local hardness reductions to a promise problem of 3 CNF satisfiability.</p>

<p><strong>An optimal tester for \(k\)-linear</strong>, by Nader Bshouty (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/123/">ECCC</a>). This paper explores two related questions. We call a function \(f \colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}\) \(k\)-linear if it equals the \(\sum_{i \in S} x_i\) for some \(S \subseteq [n]\) of size exactly \(k\). A boolean function is said to be \(k\)-linear<strong>*</strong> if it is \(j\) linear for a fixed  \(j\) where \(j \in \{0,1,2, \cdots, k\}\). The paper proves the following theorems.</p>



<ol><li>There exists a non-adaptive <em>one-sided</em> distribution free tester for \(k\)-linear<strong>*</strong> with query complexity being \(O\left(k \log k + \frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)\). This matches the two-sided lower bound (where the underlying distribution is uniform) by Blais et al [3].</li><li>Using a reduction from \(k\)-linear<strong>*</strong> to \(k\)-linear, the paper shows one can obtain a non-adpative <em>two-sided</em> distribution free tester for \(k\)-linear with same query complexity as the above result. The lower bound from Blais et al applies here also (in fact, they prove a lower bound on \(k\)-linearity).</li><li>Next up, the paper has a couple of lower bound results to accompany this. One of these results reveals the price you pay for being <em>one-sided</em> and <em>exact</em> (that is, you insist on the function being exactly \(k\)-linear). Turns out, now you have a non-adaptive one-sided uniform distribution lower bound of \(\widetilde{\Omega}(k) \log n + \Omega(1/\varepsilon)\).  If you allow adaptivity instead, the paper shows a lower bound of \(\widetilde{\Omega}(\sqrt k)\log n + \Omega(1/\varepsilon)\).</li></ol>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Amortized Edge Sampling</strong>, by Talya Eden, Saleet Mossel and Ronitt Rubinfeld (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08032">arXiv</a>). Consider the following setup. You are given query access to adjacency list of a graph \(G\) with \(n\) vertices and \(m\) edges. You can make degree queries and neighbor queries. Suppose I ask you to sample a single edge from this graph from a distribution that is pointwise \(\varepsilon\) close to the uniform distribution. Eden and Rosenbaum already showed how you can achieve this with a budget of \(\widetilde{\Theta}(n/\sqrt m)\) queries. Starting from this jump off point, the authors ask whether you can circumvent this lower bound if you want to return multiple samples from a distribution which is again pointwise close to uniform. The paper answers this question in the affirmative and shows that if you know the number of samples, \(q\), in advance you can get away with an amortized bound of \(O*(\sqrt q n/\sqrt m)\) on the total number of queries needed.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>On the High Accuracy Limitation of Adaptive Property Estimation</strong>, by Yanjun Han (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11964">arXiv</a>). Take a discrete distribution \(\mathcal{P}\) with support size \(k\) and consider the task of estimating some symmetric property of \(\mathcal{P}\) to a small \(\pm \varepsilon\) additive error. Here, a symmetric property refers to a “nice” functional defined over the probability simplex, i.e., it refers to functions \(F \colon \Delta_k \to \mathbb{R}\) where \(F(p) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} f(p_i)\) where \(f \colon (0,1) \to \mathbb{R}\). A naive attack to these estimation tasks goes through the following ritual: you get your hands on the empirical distribution, you plug it in \(F\) and you hope for the best. Turns out, you are out of luck if the function \(f\) is non-smooth and in these cases you end up with a suboptimal estimator. Previous works have also looked at more sophisticated estimators (like the <em>local moment matching or LMM and profile maximum likelihood or PML</em> estimator). Turns out, using the LMM or PML estimator leads to optimal sample complexity for a handful of symmetric properties (as long as \(\varepsilon \geq n^{-1/3}\)). This paper considers the question of what can you say for supersmall values of \(\varepsilon\) where \(n^{-1/2} \leq \varepsilon \leq n^{-1/3}\). (The \(n^{-1/2}\) appears because there are estimators that use the knowledge of \(f\) and \(\varepsilon\) can be driven all the way down to \(n^{-1/2}\) for these estimators). The paper focuses on estimators which do not exploit any structure in \(f\). In particular, the paper specializes this question to PML and shows a fundamental limitation on PML which means that the PML approach fails to be sample optimal for the entire range of \(\varepsilon\) and is sample optimal only for \(\varepsilon &gt;&gt; n^{-1/3}\) — which also confirms a conjecture of Han and Shiragur (and refutes a conjecture of Acharya et al. who postulated this is sample optimal for the entire range of \(\varepsilon\)).</p>

<p><strong>\(k\)-Forrelation Optimally Separates Quantum and Classical Query<br />Complexity</strong>, by Nikhil Bansal and Makrand Sinha (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07003">arXiv</a>). Understanding the power of quantum query over classical queries is a well motivated problem with a rich history. One of the biggest questions in this area asks for the largest separation between classical and quantum query complexities. In a breakthrough, Aaronson and Ambainis [4] showed a fundamental simulation result which confirmed that you can simulate \(q\) quantum queries with \(O(N^{1 – 1/2q})\) classical queries in the randomized decision tree model of computation as long as \(q = O(1)\). In the same paper, the authors also showed that the standard <em>forrelation</em>* problem exhibits a \(1\) versus \(\widetilde{\Omega}(\sqrt n)\) separation. This means that for \(q = 1\), you essentially have optimal separation. But what about \(q &gt; 1\)? To this end, Aaronson and Ambainis conjectured that a certain problem which they called \(k\)-forrelation — which can be computed with \(q = k/2\) queries requires at least \(\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1-1/k})\) classical queries. The current work precisely confirms this conjecture.</p>



<p>(*) The forrelation problem asks you to decide whether one Boolean function is highly correlated with the Fourier transform of a second function.</p>



<p><em><strong>(Edit:</strong> Added Later)</em>  Simon Apers points out a paper by Shrestov, Storozhenko and Wu that we missed. (Thanks Simon)! Here is a brief report on that paper.<br /></p>



<p><strong>An optimal separation of randomized and quantum query complexity</strong> (by Alexander Shrestov, Andrey Storozhenko and Pei Wu)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10223">arXiv</a>) Similar to the paper by Bansal and Sinha [BS20] mentioned above, this paper also resolves the conjecture by Aaronson and Ambainis proving the same result. Like the paper also notes, the techniques in both of these works are completely different and incomparable. On the one hand [BS20] proves the separation for an explicit function as opposed to a function chosen uniformly at random from a certain set as considered in this work. On the other hand,  the separation result shown in [BS20] only applies when the query algorithm returns the correct answer with probability at least \(1/2 + 1/poly(\log n)\) — in contrast the results in this paper apply even when the query algorithm is required to have probability of correctness be a constant at least \(1/2\). In addition, this work also proves the \(\ell\)-Fourier weight conjecture of Tal which is of independent interest beyond quantum computing.</p>



<p></p>



<p>So, it looks like all in all we had a great month with two concurrent papers both resolving Aaronson Ambainis conjecture (yet again after two concurrent papers on testing Hamiltonicity)!</p>

Nisan and Szegedy conjectured that block sensitivity is at most
polynomial in sensitivity for any Boolean function.
Until a recent breakthrough of Huang, the conjecture had been
wide open in the general case,
and was proved only for a few special classes
of Boolean functions.
Huang's result implies that block sensitivity is at most
the 4th power of sensitivity for any Boolean function.
It remains open if a tighter relationship between
sensitivity and block sensitivity holds for arbitrary Boolean functions;
the largest known gap between these measures is quadratic.

We prove tighter bounds showing that block sensitivity is at most
3rd power, and in some cases at most square of sensitivity for
subclasses of transitive functions,
defined by various properties of their DNF (or CNF) representation.
Our results improve and extend previous results regarding
transitive functions. We obtain these results by
proving tight (up to constant factors) lower bounds on the
smallest possible sensitivity of functions in these classes.

In another line of research, it has also been examined what is the
smallest possible block sensitivity of transitive functions.
Our results yield tight (up to constant factors) lower bounds
on the block sensitivity of the classes we consider.</div>

A binary code $\text{Enc}:\{0,1\}^k \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$ is $(\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon,L)$-list decodable if for every $w \in \{0,1\}^n$, there exists a set $\text{List}(w)$ of size at most $L$, containing all messages $m \in \{0,1\}^k$ such that the relative Hamming distance between $\text{Enc}(m)$ and $w$ is at most $\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon$.
A $q$-query local list-decoder is a randomized procedure that when given oracle access to a string $w$, makes at most $q$ oracle calls, and for every message $m \in \text{List}(w)$, with high probability, there exists $j \in [L]$ such that for every $i \in [k]$, with high probability, $\text{Dec}^w(i,j)=m_i$.

We prove lower bounds on $q$, that apply even if $L$ is huge (say $L=2^{k^{0.9}}$) and the rate of $\text{Enc}$ is small (meaning that $n \ge 2^{k}$):

* For $\varepsilon = 1/k^{\nu}$ for some constant $\nu&gt;0$, we prove a lower bound of $q=\Omega(\frac{\log(1/\delta)}{\varepsilon^2})$, where $\delta$ is the error probability of the local list-decoder. This bound is tight as there is a matching upper bound by Goldreich and Levin (STOC 1989) of $q=O(\frac{\log(1/\delta)}{\varepsilon^2})$ for the Hadamard code (which has $n=2^k$). This bound extends an earlier work of Grinberg, Shaltiel and Viola (FOCS 2018) which only works if $n \le 2^{k^{\nu}}$ and the number of coins tossed by $\text{Dec}$ is small (and therefore does not apply to the Hadamard code, or other codes with low rate).

* For smaller $\varepsilon$, we prove a lower bound of roughly $q = \Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon}})$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first lower bound on the number of queries of local list-decoders that gives $q \ge k$ for small $\varepsilon$.

Local list-decoders with small $\varepsilon$ form the key component in the celebrated theorem of Goldreich and Levin that extracts a hard-core predicate from a one-way function.
We show that black-box proofs cannot improve the Goldreich-Levin theorem and produce a hard-core predicate that is hard to predict with probability $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{\ell^{\omega(1)}}$ when provided with a one-way function $f:\{0,1\}^{\ell} \rightarrow \{0,1\}^{\ell}$, such that circuits of size $\text{poly}(\ell)$ cannot invert $f$ with probability $\rho=1/2^{\sqrt{\ell}}$ (or even $\rho=1/2^{\Omega(\ell)}$). This limitation applies to any proof by black-box reduction (even if the reduction is allowed to use nonuniformity and has oracle access to $f$).</div>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberhard%27s_theorem">Eberhard’s theorem</a> is a topic in the combinatorial theory of convex polyhedra that once saw a lot of research, but has faded from more recent interest. It’s named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Eberhard">Victor Eberhard</a>, a German mathematician from the late 19th and early 20th century who worked in geometry despite becoming blind at age 12 or 13. I find this hard to imagine, as my own research in geometry is based very heavily on visual thinking, but he was far from the only successful blind mathematician; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler">Leonhard Euler</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Pontryagin">Lev Pontryagin</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Morin">Bernard Morin</a> also come to mind, and there are more.</p>

<p>Anyway, Eberhard’s theorem concerns the following question. Suppose I tell you that a polyhedron has a certain number of faces of certain types. For instance, after Archimedes’ work on polytopes was lost, all we knew about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_solid">Archimedean solids</a> until their rediscovery in the Renaissance was a brief listing from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappus_of_Alexandria">Pappus of Alexandria</a> giving this information: there is one with 8 triangles and 6 squares, etc. How can we tell that these counts of faces actually determine a polyhedron?</p>

<p>The given information for Eberhard’s theorem, then, is just a collection of counts of face types (triangles, quadrilaterals, etc.), without specifying the exact shapes of these faces. The goal is to use these faces to build a simple polyhedron, one for which three edges meet at every vertex (like a cube, unlike an octahedron). One necessary condition for this to be possible is that the polyhedron must obey Euler’s polyhedral formula \(v-e+f=2\). And it’s easy to calculate the numbers of vertices, edges, and faces appearing in this formula, from the face counts. Plugging these numbers into Euler’s formula leads to a linear equation that the face counts must obey. Crucially, this linear equation omits the count of hexagons: adding or removing hexagons will not change whether Euler’s formula holds. What Eberhard’s theorem states is that, as long as the face counts obey Euler’s formula in this way, there is always some number of hexagons that can be added or removed so that the remaining faces will form a polyhedron.</p>

<p>However, calculating the fewest number of hexagons needed, or even determining whether a given number of faces of all types (including hexagons) can be put together into a polyhedron, remains somewhat mysterious. So I thought I’d play with a case that would be both simple enough to solve and still interesting: the bipartite simple polyhedra (famous from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnette%27s_conjecture">Barnette’s conjecture</a>), with one big face (a \(2n\)-gon for some \(n&gt;3\)), many small faces (\(n+3\) quadrilaterals, the number needed to make Euler’s formula hold), and a mysterious number of hexagons. What is the smallest number of hexagons that will allow the construction of a simple polyhedron with these face counts? The answer turns out to be \(\lfloor (3n-6)/2\rfloor\), achieved with polyhedra (or polyhedral graphs) in which the outer \(2n\)-gon surrounds a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cactus_graph">cactus tree</a> of 6-vertex cycles (and possibly one 4-vertex cycle), connected to each other by bridge edges:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/eberhard.svg" alt="Three hexagon-minimal bipartite simple polyhedra" /></p>

<p>The central cactus tree can be rearranged, as long as no two bridge edges have adjacent endpoints. For instance, in the graph with the dodecagon outer face, at the bottom of the figure, it’s possible for the middle six-vertex loop to have three connections to the outside polygon on one side and only one connection on the other side, or to have the four-vertex loop in the middle. But I can prove that all optimal solutions have the same overall central cactus tree structure.</p>

<p>I find it easier to think about the following equivalent rephrasing of the optimization problem: instead of finding a minimum number of hexagons that will allow us to build a polyhedron with those face counts, let’s build a polyhedron with one \(2n\)-gon face and the rest quadrilaterals and hexagons, and concentrate on minimizing the number of vertices in this polyhedron. The number of quadrilaterals will automatically come out right, and the number of hexagons will be minimized if the number of vertices is minimized.</p>

<p>Now suppose that we have any simple polyhedron with one \(2n\)-gon face and the rest quadrilaterals and hexagons. Remove the outer \(2n\)-gon from the graph, leaving a conncted subgraph, and look at the biconnected components of this subgraph. For any one component, its outer face in its induced planar embedding must be a simple cycle, with some vertices having degree two in the component (the endpoints of edges connecting the component to the rest of the graph) and some having degree three. If the component is a 4-cycle or 6-cycle, then all of its vertices have degree two. But if not, then at most four consecutive vertices of its outer cycle can have degree two, because they and the two vertices connected to them on both sides form part of the boundary of a face interior to the component, which can have at most six vertices. And the degree-three vertices of the outer cycle must come in consecutive pairs, which cannot be adjacent to the endpoints of bridge edges connecting to other biconnected components, because a degree-three vertex next to a bridge edge or next to two other degree-three vertices would combine with part of the outer \(2n\)-gon to form a face with seven or more vertices, and a degree-three vertex by itself would form a pentagon, neither of which is allowed.</p>

<p>So in a component that is not a 4-cycle or 6-cycle, the degree-two and degree-three vertices alternate around the outer cycle of the component in consecutive sequences of at most four and exactly two vertices. This implies that the number of degree-two vertices is even (because the whole cycle is even by bipartiteness) and that the number of degree-three vertices in the component (even just counting the ones on its boundary) is at least half of the number of degree-two vertices on its boundary. For the cactus trees that we’ve been using, on the other hand, the number of degree-three vertices in each cactus tree is strictly less than half of the number of degree-two vertices. So if we replace a whole non-cycle component by a cactus tree, we can get a graph with the same number of exposed degree-2 vertices, but fewer total vertices. After repeated replacement of biconnected components, at each step reducing the number of vertices, we would reach a state where the subgraph inside the \(2n\)-gon is a cactus tree. It might not meet the requirement that its bridge edges have nonadjacent endpoints, but it could always be rearranged to do so. And it might not be a cactus with at most one 4-cycle, but if not we could replace two 4-cycles by one 6-cycle and make it even smaller. So the only graphs that cannot be made smaller are the ones we started with, the cactus trees of 6-cycles and at most one 4-cycle, surrounded by an outer \(2n\)-gon.</p>

<p>We are excited to announce a new online seminar - IGAFIT Algorithmic Colloquium. This new event aims to integrate the European algorithmic community and keep it connected during the times of the pandemic. This online seminar will take place biweekly on Thursday at 14:00 CET, with the talks lasting for 45 minutes. Each talk will be followed by a networking and discussion session on topics related to the talk. We cordially invite all participants to this session. The meeting will be run on <a href="https://www.airmeet.com/e/55923fa0-eee9-11ea-8530-b3eab1e75816" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Airmeet</a>. More details on the event can be found on <a href="http://igafit.mimuw.edu.pl/?page_id=483786" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGAFIT web page</a>.</p>



<p>The first talk will be held on the 1st of October 2020.</p>



<p>October 1, 2020<br />Vera Traub, University of Bonn<br />Title: An improved approximation algorithm for ATSP<br />Abstract: In a recent breakthrough, Svensson, Tarnawski, and Végh gave the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for the asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP). In this work we revisit their algorithm. While following their overall framework, we improve on each part of it.</p>



<p>Svensson, Tarnawski, and Végh perform several steps of reducing ATSP to more and more structured instances. We avoid one of their reduction steps (to irreducible instances) and thus obtain a simpler and much better reduction to vertebrate pairs. Moreover, we show that a slight variant of their algorithm for vertebrate pairs has a much smaller approximation ratio.</p>



<p>Overall we improve the approximation ratio from 506 to 22 + ε for any ε &gt; 0. We also improve the upper bound on the integrality ratio of the standard LP relaxation from 319 to 22.</p>



<p>This is joint work with Jens Vygen.</p>



<p>Other upcoming talks include:</p>



<p>October 15, 2020<br />Thatchaphol Saranurak, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago<br />Title: An almost-linear time deterministic algorithm for expander decomposition</p>
