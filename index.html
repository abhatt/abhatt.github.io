This post is devoted to the third interview with the <a href="https://concur2020.forsyte.at/test-of-time/index.html">colleagues</a> who were selected for the first edition of the CONCUR  Test-of-Time Award. (See <a href="https://processalgebra.blogspot.com/2020/04/an-interview-with-davide-sangiorgi.html">here</a> for the interview with <a href="http://www.cs.unibo.it/~sangio/">Davide Sangiorgi</a>, and <a href="https://processalgebra.blogspot.com/2020/04/an-interview-with-nancy-lynch-and.html">here</a> for the interview with <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/lynch/">Nancy Lynch</a> and <a href="http://profs.sci.univr.it/~segala/">Roberto Segala</a>.) I asked <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~rvg/">Rob van Glabbeek</a> (Data61, CSIRO, Sydney, Australia) a few questions via email and I am happy share his answers with readers of this blog below. Rob's words brought me back to the time when the CONCUR conference started and our field of concurrency theory was roughly a decade old. I hope that his interesting account and opinions will inspire young researchers in concurrency theory of all ages.<br /><br />Luca: You receive one of the two CONCUR ToT Awards for the period  1990-1993 for your companion papers on "The Linear Time-Branching Time  Spectrum", published at CONCUR 1990 and 1993. Could you tell us briefly  what spurred you to  embark in the encyclopaedic study of process semantics you developed in  those two papers and what were your main sources of inspiration?<br /><br />Rob: My PhD supervisors, Jan Willem Klop and Jan Bergstra, were examining<br />bisimulation semantics, but also failures semantics, in collaboration<br />with Ernst-Ruediger Olderog, and at some point, together with Jos Baeten,<br />wrote a paper on ready-trace semantics to deal with a priority operator.<br />I had a need to see these activities, and also those of Tony Hoare and<br />Robin Milner, as revealing different aspects of the same greater whole,<br />rather than as isolated research efforts. This led naturally to an<br />abstraction of their work in which the crucial difference was the semantic<br />equivalence employed. Ordering these semantics in a lattice was never<br />optional for me, but necessary to see the larger picture.  It may be in<br />my nature to relate different solutions to similar problems I encounter<br />by placing them in lattices.<br /><span class="im"></span> <br />Luca: Did you imagine at the time that the papers on "The Linear Time-Branching Time Spectrum" would have so much impact? <br /><div><br /></div><div>Rob: I didn't think much about impact in those days. I wrote the papers<br />because I felt the need to do so, and given that, could just as well<br />publish them. Had I made an estimate, I would have guessed that my<br />papers would have impact, as I imagined that things that I find<br />necessary to know would interest some others too. But I would have<br />underestimated the amount of impact, in part because I had grossly<br />underestimated the size of the research community eventually working<br />on related matters.<span class="im"><br /></span></div><div><br /></div><div>Luca: In your papers, you present characterizations of process semantics in  relational form, via testing scenarios, via modal logics and in terms of  (conditional) equational axiomatizations. Of all those  characterizations, which ones do you think have been most useful in  future work? To your mind, what are the most  interesting or unexpected uses in the  literature of the notions and techniques you developed in the "The  Linear Time-Branching Time Spectrum"? </div><div> </div><div>Rob: I think that all these characterizations together shed the light on<br />process semantics that makes them understandable and useful.<br />Relational characterizations, i.e., of (bi)simulations, are often the<br />most useful to grasp what kind of relation one has, and this is essential<br />for any use. But modal characterizations are intimately linked with<br />model checking, which is one of the more successful verification tools.<br />Equational characterizations also find practical use in verification,<br />e.g., in normalization. Yet, they are most useful in illustrating<br />the essential difference between process semantics, and thus form a guide<br />in choosing the right one for an application. To me, the testing scenarios<br />are the most useful in weighing how realistic certain semantic<br />identifications are in certain application contexts.</div><div><span class="im"></span> </div><div>Luca: How much of your later work has  built on your award-winning papers? What follow-up results of yours are  you most proud of and why?</div><div> </div><div>Rob: About one third, I think.</div><div><ul><li>My work on action refinement, together with Ursula Goltz, extends theclassification of process semantics in a direction orthogonal to the linear time - branching time spectrum. I am proud of this work mostly because, for a distinct class of applications, action refinement is great criterion to tell which semantics equivalences one ought to prefer over others. These process semantics have also been used in later work on distributability with Ursula and with Jens-Wolfhard Schicke Uffmann. Distributability tells us which distributed systems can be cast as sequential systems cooperating asynchronously, and which fundamentally cannot.</li><li>I wrote several papers on Structural Operational Semantics, many jointly with Wan Fokkink, aiming to obtain congruence results for semantic equivalences. These works carefully employed the modal characterizations from my spectrum papers. I consider this work important because congruence properties are essential in verification, as we need compositionality to avoid state explosions. </li><li>I used a version of failure simulation semantics from my second spectrum paper in work with Yuxin Deng, Matthew Hennessy, Carroll Morgan and Chenyi Zhang, characterizing may- and must testing equivalences for probabilistic nondeterministic processes. Probability and nondeterminism interact in many applications, and I think that may- and must testing are the right tools to single out the essence of their semantics.</li></ul></div><div><span class="im"><br /></span> </div><div>Luca: If I remember correctly, your master thesis was in pure mathematics. Why  did you decide to move to a PhD in computer science? What was it like  to work as a PhD student at CWI in the late 1980s? How did you start  your collaborations with Jos Baeten and fellow PhD student Frits  Vaandrager, amongst others? </div><div> </div><div>Rob: I was interested in mathematical logic already since high school,<br />after winning a book on the foundations of logic set theory in a<br />mathematics Olympiad.  I found the material in my logic course,<br />thought at the University of Leiden by Jan Bergstra, fascinating, and<br />when doing a related exam at CWI, where Jan had moved to at that<br />time, and he asked me to do a PhD on related subjects, I say no reason<br />not to. But he had to convince me first that my work would not involve<br />any computer science, as my student advisor at The University of<br />Leiden, Professor Claas, had told us that this was not a real<br />science. Fortunately, Jan had no problem passing that hurdle.<br /><br />I was the third member of the team of Jan Bergstra and Jan Willem<br />Klop, after Jos Baeten had been recruited a few months earlier, but in<br />a more senior position. Frits arrived a month later than me. As we<br />were exploring similar subjects, and shared an office, it was natural<br />to collaborate. As these collaborations worked out very well, they<br />became quite strong.<br /><br />CWI was a marvelous environment in the late 1980s. Our group gradually<br />grew beyond a dozen members, but there remained a much greater<br />cohesion then I have seen anywhere else. We had weekly process<br />algebra meetings, where each of us shared our recent ideas with others<br />in the group. At those meetings, if one member presented a proof, the<br />entire audience followed it step by step, contributing meaningfully<br />where needed, and not a single error went unnoticed.</div><div><span class="im"><br /></span> </div><div>Luca: Already as PhD student, you took up leadership roles within the  community. For instance, I remember attending a workshop on "Combining  Compositionality and Concurrency" <span>in March 1988,</span> which you  co-organized with Ursula Goltz and Ernst-Ruediger Olderog. Would you  recommend to a PhD student that he/she become involved in that kind of  activities early on in their career? Do you think that doing so had a  positive effect on your future career?  </div><div> </div><div>Rob: Generally I recommend this. Although I co-organized this workshop<br />because the circumstances were right for it, and the need great; not<br />because I felt it necessary to organize things.  My advice to PhD<br />students would not be specifically to add a leadership component to<br />their CV regardless of the circumstances, but instead do take such an<br />opportunity when the time is right, and not be shy because of lack of<br />experience.</div><div> </div><div>This workshop definitively had a positive effect on my future career.<br />When finishing my PhD I inquired at Stanford and MIT for a possible<br />post-doc position, and the good impressions I had left at this<br />workshop were a factor in getting offers from both institutes.<br />In fact, Vaughan Pratt, who was deeply impressed with work I had<br />presented at this workshop, convinced me to apply straight away for an<br />assistant professorship, and this led to my job at Stanford.   </div><div><span class="im"><br /></span> </div><div>Luca: I still have vivid memories of your talk at the first CONCUR conference  in 1990 in Amsterdam, where you introduced notions of black-box  experiments on processes using an actual box and beer-glass mats. You  have attended and contributed to many of the editions of the conference  since then. To your mind, how has the focus of CONCUR changed since its  first edition in 1990? </div><div> </div><div>Rob: I think the focus on foundations has shifted somewhat to more applied<br />topics, and the scope of "concurrency theory" has broadened significantly.<br />Still, many topics from the earlier CONCURs are still celebrated today.</div><div><span class="im"><br /></span> </div><div>Luca: The last forty years have seen a huge amount of work on process algebra  and process calculi. However, the emphasis on that field of research  within concurrency theory seems to have diminished over the last few  years, even in Europe. What advice would you give to a young researcher  interested in working  on process calculi today? </div><div> </div><div>Rob: Until 10 years ago, many people I met in industry voiced the opinion<br />that formals methods in general, and process algebra in particular,<br />has been tried in the previous century, and had been found to not to<br />scale to tackle practical problems. But more recently this opinion is<br />on the way out, in part because it became clear that the kind of<br />problems solved by formal methods are much more pressing then originally<br />believed, and in part because many of the applications that were<br />deemed to hard in the past, are now being addressed quite adequately.<br />For these reasons, I think work on process calculi is still a good bet<br />for a PhD study, although a real-world application motivating the<br />theory studied is perhaps harder needed than in the past, and toy<br />examples just to illustrate the theory are not always enough.</div><div><span class="im"><br /></span> </div><div>Luca: What are the research topics that currently excite you the most?</div><div> </div><div>Rob: I am very excited about showing liveness properties, in Lamport's<br />sense, telling that a modeled system eventually achieves a desirable outcome.<br />And even more in creating process algebraic verification frameworks<br />that are in principle able to do this. I have come to believe that<br />traditional approaches popular in process algebra and temporal logic<br />can only deal with liveness properties when making fairness<br />assumptions that are too strong and lead to unwarranted conclusions.<br />Together with Peter Hoefner I have been advocating a weaker concept of<br />fairness, that we call justness, that is much more suitable as a basis<br />for formulating liveness properties. Embedding this concept into the<br />conceptual foundations of process algebra and concurrency theory, in<br />such a way that it can be effectively used in verification, is for a me<br />a challenging task, involving many exciting open questions.<br /><br />A vaguely related subject that excites me since the end of last year,<br />is the extension of standard process algebra with a time-out operator,<br />while still abstaining from quantifying time. I believe that such an<br />extension reaches exactly the right level of expressiveness necessary<br />for many applications.<br /><br />Both topics also relate with the impossibility of correctly expressing<br />expressing mutual exclusion in standard process algebras, a discovery<br />that called forth many philosophical questions, such as under which<br />assumptions on our hardware is mutual exclusion, when following the<br />formal definitions of Dijkstra and others, even theoretically implementable.</div><div> </div></div>

improving the previous best known bound of $\mathcal{O}(n^{1.75})$. We deduce
that, beyond a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\log n})$ factor, the polynomial method

stochastic rewards problem, that is, the one sided online bipartite matching
problem where edges adjacent to an online node must be probed to determine if
they exist, based on known edge probabilities. If a probed edge exists, it must
be used in the matching (if possible). We consider the competitiveness of
online algorithms in four different models. Namely, we consider the following
stochastic reward problems: when the stochastic graph is not known and the
order of online arrivals is determined uniformly at random (i.e., the ROM
model); when the stochastic graph is known to the algorithm and the order of
arrival of online vertices is determined adversarially; when the stochastic
graph is known and the order of arrival of online vertices is determined
uniformly at random; and finally when the online vertices are generated i.i.d.
from a known distribution on the vertices of a known stochastic (type) graph.
In all these settings, the algorithm does not have any control on the ordering
of the online nodes. We study these models under various assumptions on the
patience (number of given probes) of the online vertices, and whether edges or
offline vertices are weighted in determining the stochastic reward. Our main
contribution is to establish new and improved competitive bounds in these four
models.
</p>
<p>In all settings, there is one ideal benchmark (the optimal offline probing
algorithm) relative to which the competitive ratio is defined. For establishing
competitive ratios we introduce a new LP relaxation which upper bounds the
performance of the ideal benchmark.

homology, has been generalized to measure the distance between functors modeled
on many posets or even small categories. Existing theories require that such a
poset have a superlinear family of translations or a similar structure.
However, many posets of interest to topological data analysis, such as zig-zag
posets and the face relation poset of a cell-complex, do not admit interesting
translations, and consequently don't admit a nice theory of interleavings. In
this paper we show how one can side-step this limitation by providing a general
theory where one maps to a poset that does admit interesting translations, such
as the lattice of down sets, and then defines interleavings relative to this
map. Part of our theory includes a rigorous notion of discretization or
"pixelization" of poset modules, which in turn we use for interleaving
inference. We provide an approximation condition that in the setting of
lattices gives rise to two possible pixelizations, both of which are guaranteed
to be close in the interleaving distance. Finally, we conclude by considering
interleaving inference for cosheaves over a metric space and give an explicit
description of interleavings over a grid structure on Euclidean space.

bounded in the number of variables, that satisfies the following properties:

<p>$\bullet$ For every family $\{f_n\}$ of polynomials in VP, where $f_n$ is an
$n$ variate polynomial of degree at most $n^c$ with bounded integer
coefficients and for $N = \binom{n^c + n}{n}$, $P_{N,c}$ \emph{vanishes} on the

</p>
<p>In other words, there are efficiently computable defining equations for

an analogous statement for the seemingly larger class VNP. Thus, in this

\emph{against} a natural proof like barrier for proving algebraic circuit lower
bounds, a framework for which was proposed in the works of Forbes, Shpilka and
Volk (2018), and Grochow, Kumar, Saks and Saraf (2017).

optimization: the goal is to connect a set $T$ of terminals in a graph $G$ by a

$\delta$-dense version of {\sc Steiner Tree}, where each terminal has at least
$\delta |V(G)\setminus T|$ neighbours outside $T$, for a fixed $\delta &gt; 0$.

<p>We study a generalization of pairwise $\delta$-dense {\sc Steiner Forest},

the problem is $\mathsf{APX}$-hard.

of two Boolean matrices (MW for short) has a number of important applications,
in particular the all-pairs lowest common ancestor (LCA) problem in directed
acyclic graphs (dags). The best known upper time-bound on the MW problem for
n\times n Boolean matrices of the form O(n^{2.575}) has not been substantially
improved since 2006. In order to obtain faster algorithms for this problem, we
study quantum algorithms for MW and approximation algorithms for MW (in the
standard computational model). Some of our quantum algorithms are input or
output sensitive. Our fastest quantum algorithm for the MW problem, and
consequently for the related problems, runs in time
\tilde{O}(n^{2+\lambda/2})=\tilde{O}(n^{2.434}), where \lambda satisfies the
equation \omega(1, \lambda, 1) = 1 + 1.5 \, \lambda and \omega(1, \lambda, 1)
is the exponent of the multiplication of an n \times n^{\lambda}$ matrix by an
n^{\lambda} \times n matrix. Next, we consider a relaxed version of the MW
problem (in the standard model) asking for reporting a witness of bounded rank
(the maximum witness has rank 1) for each non-zero entry of the matrix product.
By reducing the relaxed problem to the so called k-witness problem, we provide
an algorithm that reports for each non-zero entry C[i,j] of the product matrix
C a witness of rank O(\lceil W_C(i,j)/k\rceil ), where W_C(i,j) is the number
of witnesses for C[i,j], with high probability. The algorithm runs in
\tilde{O}(n^{\omega}k^{0.4653} +n^2k) time, where \omega=\omega(1,1,1).

\epsilon}}\right)$ approximation in time
$n^{\mathcal{O}\left(1/\epsilon\right)}$.
</p>
<p>We ask what are some "easier" instances of this problem? We propose some
natural semi-random models of instances with a planted dense subgraph, and
study approximation algorithms for computing the densest subgraph in them.
These models are inspired by the semi-random models of instances studied for
various other graph problems such as the independent set problem, graph
partitioning problems etc. For a large range of parameters of these models, we
get significantly better approximation factors for the Densest $k$-subgraph
problem. Moreover, our algorithm recovers a large part of the planted solution.

rules in the literature of multi-winner elections. The problem of determining
if there exists a committee of size k that has a Chamberlin-Courant
(respectively, Monroe) score of at most r is known to be NP-complete. We
consider the following natural problems in this setting: a) given a committee S
of size k as input, is it an optimal k-sized committee, and b) given a
candidate c and a committee size k, does there exist an optimal k-sized
committee that contains c?
</p>
<p>In this work, we resolve the complexity of both problems for the
Chamberlin-Courant and Monroe voting rules in the settings of rankings as well
as approval ballots. We show that verifying if a given committee is optimal is
coNP-complete whilst the latter problem is complete for $\Theta_{2}^{P}$. We
also demonstrate efficient algorithms for the second problem when the input
consists of single-peaked rankings. Our contribution fills an essential gap in
the literature for these important multi-winner rules.

constraints on a set of identical machines to minimize the makespan objective
function. Understanding the exact approximability of the problem when the
number of machines is a constant is a well-known question in scheduling theory.
Indeed, an outstanding open problem from the classic book of Garey and Johnson
asks whether this problem is NP-hard even in the case of 3 machines and
unit-length jobs. In a recent breakthrough, Levey and Rothvoss gave a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, which runs in nearly quasi-polynomial
time, for the case when job have unit lengths. However, a substantially more
difficult case where jobs have arbitrary processing lengths has remained open.
</p>
<p>We make progress on this more general problem. We show that there exists a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm (with similar running time as that of
Levey and Rothvoss) for the non-migratory setting: when every job has to be
scheduled entirely on a single machine, but within a machine the job need not
be scheduled during consecutive time steps. Further, we also show that our
algorithmic framework generalizes to another classic scenario where, along with
the precedence constraints, the jobs also have communication delay constraints.
Both of these fundamental problems are highly relevant to the practice of
datacenter scheduling.

tasks, traditionally performed by employees or contractors, to a large group of
smart-phone users by means of an open call. With the increasing complexity of
the crowdsourcing applications, requesters find it essential to harness the
power of collaboration among the workers by forming teams of skilled workers
satisfying their complex tasks' requirements. This type of MCS is called
Collaborative MCS (CMCS). Previous CMCS approaches have mainly focused only on
the aspect of team skills maximization. Other team formation studies on social
networks (SNs) have only focused on social relationship maximization. In this
paper, we present a hybrid approach where requesters are able to hire a team
that, not only has the required expertise, but also is socially connected and
can accomplish tasks collaboratively. Because team formation in CMCS is proven
to be NP-hard, we develop a stochastic algorithm that exploit workers knowledge
about their SN neighbors and asks a designated leader to recruit a suitable
team. The proposed algorithm is inspired from the optimal stopping strategies
and uses the odds-algorithm to compute its output. Experimental results show
that, compared to the benchmark exponential optimal solution, the proposed
approach reduces computation time and produces reasonable performance results.

In its
most basic form the goal is to fit a degree $d$ polynomial to a response
variable $y$ in terms of an $n$-dimensional input vector $x$. This is extremely
well-studied with many applications and has sample and runtime complexity
$\Theta(n^d)$. Can one achieve better runtime if the intrinsic dimension of the
data is much smaller than the ambient dimension $n$? Concretely, we are given
samples $(x,y)$ where $y$ is a degree at most $d$ polynomial in an unknown
$r$-dimensional projection (the relevant dimensions) of $x$. This can be seen
both as a generalization of phase retrieval and as a special case of learning
multi-index models where the link function is an unknown low-degree polynomial.
Note that without distributional assumptions, this is at least as hard as junta
learning.
</p>
<p>In this work we consider the important case where the covariates are
Gaussian. We give an algorithm that learns the polynomial within accuracy
$\epsilon$ with sample complexity that is roughly $N = O_{r,d}(n
\log^2(1/\epsilon) (\log n)^d)$ and runtime $O_{r,d}(N n^2)$. Prior to our
work, no such results were known even for the case of $r=1$. We introduce a new
filtered PCA approach to get a warm start for the true subspace and use
geodesic SGD to boost to arbitrary accuracy; our techniques may be of
independent interest, especially for problems dealing with subspace recovery or
analyzing SGD on manifolds.

<div>I asked my Grad Ramsey Theory class to email me about whatever thoughts they have on the pandemic that they want to share with the world, with the intend of making some of them into a blog post. I thought there would be several short thoughts for one post. And I may still do that post. But I got a FANTASTIC long answer from one Emily Mae Kaplitz. Normally I would ask to shorten or edit a guest post, but I didn't do that here since that might make it less authentic.</div><div><br /></div><div>Here is Emily Kaplitz's email (with her enthusiastic permission)</div><div><br /></div><div>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br /></div><div>Ok so this might be super ranty, (It definitely is.) but I think it is super important to bring up in a blog post written by an academic that will be probably read by other academics. </div><div><br /></div><div>The students that are being most affected by this pandemic with online learning are disability students. As a disability student, we carefully cultivate the way that we learn best based off of years of trial and error. This is harder than anything else, we have to face in our lifetime. Most of the time disability students are left on the back burner and that statement is so much more prevalent right now. My friends brother is autistic. He is struggling so much right now because he is at home. Disability students learn what environment works best for them and at home is usually not the best place. We have to split our lives into different boxes that each have different tools to help us get our brains to focus and work well when we need them too. Disability students will rely on everything being planned out, so that they can succeed. Teachers and professors cannot understand the stress and strain that having to work at home puts on the student. Every time I go to another school, it is a struggle to figure out what new thing I need to add into the mix and what old thing I need to throw away. It's exhausting, but when I go from one school to another I at least know that the basics are the same. I sit in a classroom, the professors lecturer, and then I do work at home that is assigned to me. Changing to online changes that dynamic so much. A professor cannot see when a student is visibly struggling with a topic because we'll all behind computers. A neurotypical person might ask, "well why don't you just ask a question? Why don't you just let the professor know that you don't understand". Let me answer that simply. If all your life you've been silenced because of something that you cannot control, is your first reaction to speak out or to stay silent. It is so hard for disability students to ask a question after we've been labeled the dumb kid. Every time we ask a question, we always have the thought of: is this going to make me sound stupid. We've worked so hard to eliminate that word from our vocabulary and from others who will throw that word back at us. Disability students are being left in the hands of their parents and teachers/professors who do not understand us and our needs even if they try to or want to. It is so hard for us to explain what our normal is because we don't live your normal and therefore don't know the difference. Many disability students have their confidence slashed the moment they enter a classroom and realize that they are not like the other kids. Even more so because they don't understand why they aren't. Disability students are one of the most hard-working individuals when we have a cheerleader to cheer us on because it's hard. It's harder than anything anyone has to do. Because no one listens to you when you are stupid and no one cares for you if you're not easy to care for unless they are given a specific reason to. Fighting a losing battle every day is awful. Now imagine all of your weapons that you have carefully crafted over the years have been taken away and you are left defenseless. While we have things like ADS that are supposed to help support us, it's not enough. Just like putting a Band-Aid on an open infected wound will not be enough. Now more than ever we need to learn from this as academics. We need to learn that helping disability students does not only help disability students. It helps all students because all students learn differently. All students if given the chance can excel at any field that we put them in. We just have to figure out the best way to get that student to shine. That is one of the reasons why I am a PhD student right now. I saw in the tutoring center at my undergrad how many students came to me with so much frustration about something they are doing in class. Both students with disabilities and without. These students are constantly apologizing because they don't understand something. In one session by just changing the way that we talk about a subject the student was able to get it in less time than the professor taught it. I've had students come to me after an exam and tell me that the only reason they got the grade that they did was because in their head was my voice coaching them on a subject. We are not teaching optimally. We are teaching the way that it has been done for years and years and years and that is not the best way to teach. It might be the best way to teach the strongest links but really the link that matters the most is the weakest link that will snap under pressure because you can't pull a tractor with a broken link. Disability students think differently. Imagine how many impossible problems we can solve when we have people that think differently. But that's just my two cents as a disability student who is struggling and sees other disability students struggling every day. And really just wants to help all students succeed.</div><div><br /></div><div>I blame any misspellings, grammar errors, and run on sentences on my speech to text and text to speech. This was a long email and if we were on tumblr, I would post a potato at the end. Since we aren't, I will leave this email with this. Thank you for taking the time to read this rant. Even if you don't include this in your blog post, I believe one person reading this has made the difference.</div><div><br /></div><div>Thanks!</div><div><br /></div><div>Emily Mae Kaplitz</div></div>

For every constant c &gt; 0, we show that there is a family {P_{N,c}} of polynomials whose degree and algebraic circuit complexity are polynomially bounded in the number of variables, and that satisfies the following properties:
* For every family {f_n} of polynomials in VP, where f_n is an n variate polynomial of degree at most n^c with bounded integer coefficients and for N = \binom{n^c + n}{n}, P_{N,c} -vanishes- on the coefficient vector of f_n.
* There exists a family {h_n} of polynomials where h_n is an n variate polynomial of degree at most n^c with bounded integer coefficients such that for N = \binom{n^c + n}{n}, P_{N,c} -does not vanish- on the coefficient vector of h_n.

In other words, there are efficiently computable defining equations for polynomials in VP that have small integer coefficients.
In fact, we also prove an analogous statement for the seemingly larger class VNP. Thus, in this setting of polynomials with small integer coefficients, this provides evidence -against- a natural proof like barrier for proving algebraic circuit lower bounds, a framework for which was proposed in the works of Forbes, Shpilka and Volk (2018), and Grochow, Kumar, Saks and Saraf (2017).

Our proofs are elementary and rely on the existence of (non-explicit) hitting sets for VP (and VNP) to show that there are efficiently constructible, low degree defining equations for these classes, and also extend to finite fields of small size.</div>

Motivated by the question of data quantization and "binning," we revisit the problem of identity testing of discrete probability distributions. Identity testing (a.k.a. one-sample testing), a fundamental and by now well-understood problem in distribution testing, asks, given a reference distribution (model) $\mathbf{q}$ and samples from an unknown distribution $\mathbf{p}$, both over $[n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$, whether $\mathbf{p}$ equals $\mathbf{q}$, or is significantly different from it.

In this paper, we introduce the related question of identity up to binning, where the reference distribution $\mathbf{q}$ is over $k \ll n$ elements: the question is then whether there exists a suitable binning of the domain $[n]$ into $k$ intervals such that, once "binned," $\mathbf{p}$ is equal to $\mathbf{q}$. We provide nearly tight upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity of this new question, showing both a quantitative and qualitative difference with the vanilla identity testing one, and answering an open question of Canonne (2019). Finally, we discuss several extensions and related research directions.</div>

<p>The usual definition of a Euclidean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_center">triangle center</a> is a point defined from a triangle in a way that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivariant_map">equivariant</a> under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)">similarity transformations</a>, meaning that applying the transformation to a triangle and then constructing its center produces the same point as constructing the center first and then transforming it. These include familiar points defined from triangles like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthocenter">orthocenter</a> (where perpendiculars to the sides meet), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incenter">incenter</a> (the center of the inscribed circle), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcenter">circumcenter</a> (the center of the circumscribed circle). What I have in mind in this post is a similarly-defined concept, but with a different group of transformations than similarity: the combination of any two separate linear transformations to the two coordinate axes of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_plane">Cartesian plane</a>, or transformations that swap the (transformed) axes. Another way of describing these transformations is that they preserve axis-parallel lines and relative area. They also preserve other lines and parallelism of lines.</p>

<p>One of the standard Euclidean triangle centers turns out to be a Cartesian center as well: the centroid has as its coordinates the average of the three triangle vertex coordinates, and this coordinatewise calculation (independent of the ordering of the three vertices) shows it to be equivariant under Cartesian transformations. It is also the point where the three lines through each vertex and opposite side midpoint meet.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/centroid.svg" alt="Centroid of a triangle" /></p>

<p>Similarly, we can find a Cartesian triangle center from the coordinatewise median of the three vertices.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/median.svg" alt="Median of a triangle" /></p>

<p>The center of the axis-parallel bounding box is also a Cartesian triangle center, again computed coordinatewise as the average of the minimum and maximum coordinates.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/bbcenter.svg" alt="Bounding-box center of a triangle" /></p>

<p>But a Cartesian triangle center does not have to be determined coordinatewise in this way. As an example, denote the three triangle vertices by  and consider the point  with the property that the axis-parallel bounding boxes of the three line segments  all have equal area. For two points  and , the locus of points for which the two bounding boxes have equal area is a line through the other two corners of the bounding box of segment . (To see this, consider a linear transformation that takes this bounding box to a square, and apply symmetry.) The three lines defined in this way from the three pairs of vertices of a non-degenerate triangle always meet in a point, the center we are seeking. (This follows from the shared equality of the three rectangles, but it is also an instance of the dual of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappus%27s_hexagon_theorem">Pappus’s theorem</a>.) And this point is equivariant under Cartesian transformations because these transformations preserve the ratios of areas of bounding rectangles.</p>

<p>You can tell it’s not a coordinatewise center because, in the figure above, the triangle vertices have equally spaced -coordinates, from which it follows that all coordinatewise centers lie on the horizontal line with median -coordinate, but this center doesn’t.</p>

<p>In general, the geometry of the plane with Cartesian instead of Euclidean transformations does not seem to have been very thoroughly explored. These examples show, I think, that there are interesting things to find there.</p>

<div class="content" lang="en">
<p>Yesterday the Italian prime minister announced the timeline of the loosening of the lockdown. Some manufacturing restarted yesterday, and some customer-facing businesses will gradually reopen between next Monday and the beginning of June.</p>
<p><span id="more-4369"></span></p>
<p>Since the start of the lockdown 51 days ago, it was clear that the condition to “reopen” was to have in place a “test-trace-isolate” plan to find infected people as soon as possible after their contagion, trace their contacts, and isolate them. For this, one needs an infrastructure for large-scale testing with quick turnaround, a well-staffed agency to do manual tracing or an app to do it automatically, and facilities to isolate people who are infected and not in need of hospitalization.</p>
<p>None of this has been done. There hasn’t been a sufficient ramp-up of testing capacity; as far as I know no additional people have been hired and trained for manual contact-tracing; there is an app for digital contact-tracing, but the plan to adopt it appears to have been shelved; if people test positive and are well they are asked to stay home, potentially with their family members, who are free to leave as they please.</p>
<p>All our eggs are in the basket of social distancing. The humor site Kotiomkin posted “Basically, phase 2 will rely on everybody’s common sense. We are fucked”.</p>
<p>The problem is that social distancing requires a common-sense avoidance of close contacts with other people, and the government can give guidelines on how to achieve it, but eventually it has to rely on everybody’s sense of responsibility. Unfortunately, the national mood around regulations is to immediately look for loopholes. </p>
<p>For example the initial lockdown measures stipulated that one could leave home to go buy groceries. Then when the police would stop people tens of miles away from their home, people would say “I drove here to buy groceries”, “but we are thirty miles away from where you live”, “yes but here the groceries are better”. So a subsequent amendment stipulated that one could buy groceries only in the town of residence, making it hard for people living next to a town border, for whom the closest grocery store was across the town line. In fact, every time I have encountered a crazy Italian law or regulation, and asked around for the likely reason it was instituted, it was usually to close a loophole in a previous regulation, which in turn had been put in place to close a loophole in a third regulation, and basically it’s loophole-closing all the way down to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_law">Roman law</a>.</p>
<p>I think that, from this point on, the story of the Italian covid-19 epidemic will not show the future of the rest of the Western world, but will evolve in its own timeline. Meanwhile, there are a couple of lessons that are still relevant, particularly in the comparison between Lombardy and NYC, which continue to track each other remarkably well.</p>
<p><img src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/2020-05-28-nyc-daily.png?w=584" alt="2020-05-28-nyc-daily" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4375" /><img src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/2020-05-28-nyc.png?w=584" alt="2020-05-28-nyc" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4376" /></p>
<p>One is that, at one point, it was decided to move older people with mild cases of covid-19 from hospital to nursing homes, to open up beds in hospitals. Since the personnel of nursing homes are not trained in the safety procedures for infectious diseases, and since nursing homes host older, frail people who are the highest-risk category for this illness, the result was a huge number of deaths in these nursing homes. Now nursing homes in New York are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/nursing-homes-coronavirus.html">being asked to take covid-19 patients from hospitals</a>.</p>
<p>The other is that an analysis of all-cause mortality shows a spike in March such that the difference between the typical March all-cause mortality and the March 2020 all-cause mortality is much bigger than the number of confirmed covid-19 deaths. Now the same phenomenon is being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/27/upshot/coronavirus-deaths-new-york-city.html"> observed in New York City</a>, with numbers similar to Lombardy’s. Notably, the baseline all-case mortality rate in Lombardy is much higher than in New York City (because  population growth has stalled and the demographic skews older), so while the absolute number of additional deaths is similar, the relative increase is a much more dramatic 6x in NYC versus roughly 4x in Lombardy. </p></div>

<div class="content">
For a fixed "pattern" graph $G$, the $\textit{colored}$ $G\textit{-subgraph isomorphism problem}$ (denoted $\mathrm{SUB}(G)$) asks, given an $n$-vertex graph $H$ and a coloring $V(H) \to V(G)$, whether $H$ contains a properly colored copy of $G$. The complexity of this problem is tied to parameterized versions of $\mathit{P}$ ${=}?$ $\mathit{NP}$ and $\mathit{L}$ ${=}?$ $\mathit{NL}$, among other questions. An overarching goal is to understand the complexity of $\mathrm{SUB}(G)$, under different computational models, in terms of natural invariants of the pattern graph $G$.

In this paper, we establish a close relationship between the $\textit{formula complexity}$ of $\mathrm{SUB}$ and an invariant known as $\textit{tree-depth}$ (denoted $\mathrm{td}(G)$). $\mathrm{SUB}(G)$ is known to be solvable by monotone $\mathit{AC^0}$ formulas of size $O(n^{\mathrm{td}(G)})$. Our main result is an $n^{\tilde\Omega(\mathrm{td}(G)^{1/3})}$ lower bound for formulas that are monotone $\textit{or}$ have sub-logarithmic depth. This complements a lower bound of Li, Razborov and Rossman (SICOMP 2017) relating tree-width and $\mathit{AC^0}$ circuit size. As a corollary, it implies a stronger homomorphism preservation theorem for first-order logic on finite structures (Rossman, ITCS 2017).

The technical core of this result is an $n^{\Omega(k)}$ lower bound in the special case where $G$ is a complete binary tree of height $k$, which we establish using the $\textit{pathset framework}$ introduced in (Rossman, SICOMP 2018). (The lower bound for general patterns follows via a recent excluded-minor characterization of tree-depth (Czerwi\'nski et al, arXiv:1904.13077).) Additional results of this paper extend the pathset framework and improve upon both, the best known upper and lower bounds on the average-case formula size of $\mathrm{SUB}(G)$ when $G$ is a path.</div>

<p>(I am now on <a href="https://twitter.com/boazbaraktcs">Twitter</a> ,  so you can follow this blog there too if you prefer it. –Boaz)</p>



<p>Between Zoom meetings and deadlines, I thought I’d jot down a few of my impressions so far on what lessons we can draw from this period on how well research and education can work online.  I’ve had a few surprises in both directions – things that worked better than I would have expected, and aspects that were more problematic than I realized. These are personal impressions – please do comment on your own experiences.</p>



<p>As a rule of thumb, the interactions that most successfully replicate online are those that are relatively short and focused (an hour or so – e.g., a focused research meeting, seminar talk, or a lecture in a course).  Other interactions (e.g., faculty meetings) are also fairly easily to port online, perhaps because the original wasn’t that great to begin with.</p>



<p>The things that are harder to replicate are sustained interactions over longer periods. These include more extended and less directed research collaborations, informal workshops, as well as support for students outside lectures in education.</p>



<p><strong>Works well: Research seminars</strong></p>



<p>I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how effective research seminars such as our <a href="https://mltheory.org/">machine learning theory seminar</a> are over Zoom. In particular these were no less interactive than physical seminars – in fact people are offten <em>more</em> comfortable asking questions on chat than they would during in-person seminars. I hope such seminars become common practice even after this period ends- flying a speaker across the country or the world to give an hour talk doesn’t makes much sense given that there is a perfectly satisfactory alternative. </p>



<p><strong>Works well: Lectures</strong></p>



<p>This term I am teaching <a href="https://cs127.boazbarak.org/schedule/">cryptography</a>, and online lectures on Zoom have gone surprisingly well (after  working out some <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2020/03/26/technology-for-theory-covid-19-edition/">technical issues</a>). Students participate on chat and ask questions, and seem to be following the lecture quite well. The important caveat is that lectures only work well for the students that attend and can follow them. For students who need extra support, it’s become much harder to access it.  It’s also much easier for students to (literally) “fall off the screen” and fall behind in a course, which brings me to the next point.</p>



<p><strong>Works less well: Support outside lectures</strong></p>



<p>Lectures are just one component of a course. Most of students’ learning occurs outside the classroom, where students meet together and work on problem sets, or discuss course material. These interactions between students (both related and unrelated to course) are where much of their intellectual growth happens. </p>



<p>All these interactions are greatly diminished online, and I did not yet see a good alternative. I’ve seen reduced attendance in office hours and sections, and reports are that students find it much harder to have the sort of chance discussions and opportunities to find study partners that they value so much.  If anything, this experience had made me <em>less</em> positive about the possibility of online education replacing physical colleges (though there are interesting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva_Schools_at_KGI">hybrid models</a>, where the students are co-located but lecturers are online).</p>



<p><strong>Works less well: unstructured research collaborations</strong></p>



<p>A focused meeting reporting on results or deciding on work allocation works pretty well over Zoom. So far it seems that extended brainstorming meetings, such as talking to someone over several hours in a coffeeshop, are much harder to replicate. In particular, a good part of such meetings is often spent with people staring in silence into their notebooks. As I <a href="https://twitter.com/boazbaraktcs/status/1253330145789673473">wrote</a>,  mutual silence seems to be very hard to do over Zoom.</p>



<p>Generally, informal week-long workshops, where much time is devoted to unstructured discussions, are ones that are most important to hold in person, and are hard (or maybe impossible) to replicate online. I have still not attended an online conference, but I suspect that these aspects of the conference would also be the ones hardest to replicate.</p>



<p><strong>Works well: faculty meetings</strong></p>



<p>I’ve always found it hard to bring a laptop to a faculty meeting and get work done, while listening with one ear to what’s going on. This is so much easier over Zoom <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt="🙂" /></p></div>

<div class="content" lang="en">
<p>Last quarter, I taught <a href="https://omereingold.wordpress.com/cs-353-the-practice-of-theory-research/">a course on research methods</a> in TOC, which gave me an opportunity to think through many aspects of research. I was promoting a human-centric perspective on research: how to facilitate better research by addressing the conditions needed for an individual researcher and groups of researchers to succeed. As science is a communal effort, the communication of science is critical, and thus one of the topics we covered is oral presentations.</p>
<p>There are plenty of resources about research talks, and mostly they emphasize form over matter. How many words in a slide? How many slides in a talk? how to and how not to use font colors? How to and how not to use animation? and so on. While all of these are important, I find that the failing of many research talks is on a much more basic level.</p>
<p>Think back to a research talk you heard recently, or to one you heard a few months ago. You may remember how you felt and what you thought of the talk but what do you remember of this talk in terms of content? Most of us will find that we don’t remember much, I rarely do. Yet in our presentations, we often follow a research-paper-like mold and squeeze in many little details that are somehow important to us, forgetting that they will all vanish in our audience’s memory soon after (or completely missed in the first place). Giving a talk (writing a paper, writing a blog post etc.) is about communication: who is your audience? what are the limitation of the medium? what is the message you want to convey? Since so little stays with the audience long term, it makes sense to make sure that this little will be what seems most important for you to convey.</p>
<p>The idea I am promoting here is not new, and there are various techniques towards this goal. One (which I think Oded Goldreich shared with me), is to think of audience’s attention as a limited currency. Whenever you share a big idea you spend a big token and other ideas cost a smaller token. Imagine you have one or two big tokens and a few smaller tokens. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OFAhBw0OXs">Another approach</a>, emphasizes the notion of <strong>a premise</strong>. The idea promoted here is that a talk needs a premise and this should be the title of the talk. Furthermore, every slide needs a premise and it should be the title of the slide. A premise is a main idea and is a complete sentence. It is not unusual to find a slide titled “Analysis” or “Efficiency” but neither of these is a premise. “Problem X has an efficient algorithm” could be. The talk’s premise could help you distill what you want the audience to take out of your talk. It also helps shape the talk, as everything that doesn’t serve the premise shouldn’t be there. Note that each paper can provoke many different premises and thus many different talks.</p>
<p>Here I want to play with a different idea, that I find intriguing, even if it may seem a bit extreme. It will not be controversial that a good talk (and paper) tells a story. After all, humans understand and remember narratives. But could we take inspiration from the form of storytelling in fiction writing? A vast literature, classifies different kinds of stories and explores their templates (see for example <a href="http://storybistro.com/7-story-frameworks/">this short discussion</a>).  Can we find analogues to these types in scientific research talks?</p>
<p>The type of story that is easiest to relate to is the <strong>Quest/Hero’s Journey</strong> (think Lord of the Rings). These have several distinct ingredients: a call to adventure, tests, allies, enemies, ordeal, reward, victorious return. Some research talks that follow this template do it well and preserve a sense of suspense and excitement, others seem like a long list of problems and the tricks that the work uses to handle them.</p>
<p>I believe that many other story templates can find analogues is research talks as well. Here are my initial attempts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coming of age</strong> stories – this area of research previously only had naive ideas but this works brings significant depth.</li>
<li><strong>The Under<span style="color: #000000;">dog</span></strong><span style="color: #000000;"> (think David and Goliath): a modest technique that concurred a great challenge.</span></li>
<li><strong>Rags to Riches</strong> (think the Ugly Duckling): an area or technique that were not successful prove powerful.
<ul>
<li>Similarly: <strong>Rebirth</strong> (reinvention, renewal).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Comedy</strong> (or the Clarity Tale) – conceptual works shedding a new perspective.</li>
<li><strong>Tragedy</strong> (or the Cautionary Tale) – Some impossibility results come to mind (couldn’t we view Arrow’s impossibility theorem as being tragic?)</li>
<li><strong>Redemption stories</strong>: the field so far has missed the point, was misleading or harmful, but this work makes amends.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you suggest papers and a story type that could fit them?</p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
In a recent work, Kumar, Meka, and Sahai (FOCS 2019) introduced the notion of bounded collusion protocols (BCPs), in which $N$ parties wish to compute some joint function $f:(\{0,1\}^n)^N\to\{0,1\}$ using a public blackboard, but such that only $p$ parties may collude at a time. This generalizes well studied models in multiparty communication complexity, such as the number-in-hand (NIH) and number-on-forehead (NOF) models, which are just endpoints on this rich spectrum. We construct explicit hard functions against this spectrum, and achieve a tradeoff between collusion and complexity. Using this, we obtain improved leakage-resilient secret sharing schemes against bounded collusion protocols. 

Our main tool in obtaining hard functions against BCPs are explicit constructions of leakage resilient extractors against BCPs for a wide range of parameters. Kumar et al. (FOCS 2019) studied  such extractors and called them cylinder intersection extractors. In fact, such extractors directly yield correlation bounds against BCPs. We focus on the following setting: the input to the extractor consists of $N$ independent sources of length $n$, and the leakage function Leak $:(\{0,1\}^n)^N\to\{0,1\}^\mu\in\mathcal{F}$ is a BCP with some collusion bound $p$ and leakage (output length) $\mu$. While our extractor constructions are very general, we highlight some interesting parameter settings:

1. In the case when the input sources are uniform, and $p=0.99N$ parties collude, our extractor can handle $n^{\Omega(1)}$ bits of leakage, regardless of the dependence between $N,n$. The best NOF lower bound (i.e., $p=N-1$) on the other hand requires $N&lt;\log n$ even to handle $1$ bit of leakage.

2. Next, we show that for the same setting as above, we can drop the entropy requirement to $k=$ polylog $n$, while still handling polynomial leakage for $p=0.99N$.  This resolves an open question about cylinder intersection extractors raised by Kumar et al. (FOCS 2019), and we find an application of such low entropy extractors in a new type of secret sharing.

We also provide an explicit compiler that transforms any function with high NOF (distributional) communication complexity into a leakage-resilient extractor that can handle polylogarithmic entropy and substantially more leakage against BCPs. Thus any improvement of NOF lower bounds will immediately yield better leakage-resilient extractors.

Using our extractors against BCPs, we obtain improved $N$-out-of-$N$ leakage-resilient secret sharing schemes. The previous best scheme from Kumar et al. (FOCS 2019) required share size to grow exponentially in the collusion bound, and thus cannot efficiently handle $p=\omega(\log N)$. Our schemes have no dependence of this form, and can thus handle collusion size $p=0.99N$.</div>

The proof technique builds upon Kabanets' easy witness method [Kab01] as implemented by Impagliazzo et. al [IKW02], with a separate diagonalization carried out on each of the two alternatives in the win-win argument. We remark that even though the easy witness method is a key component in many celebrated results in derandomization, we are not aware of any previous unconditional separation like the one we show.

We remark that the result relativizes. We could not prove a similar result for total functions, nor for functions in ZTime(T(n)) for T(n) below a half-exponential function (i.e., T such that T(T(n)) &lt; 2^n).</div>

We consider the following question: using a source of labeled data and interaction with an untrusted prover, what is the complexity of verifying that a given hypothesis is "approximately correct"? We study interactive proof systems for PAC verification, where a verifier that interacts with a prover is required to accept good hypotheses, and reject bad hypotheses. Both the verifier and the prover are efficient and have access to data samples from an unknown distribution. We are interested in cases where the verifier can use significantly less data than is required for (agnostic) PAC learning, or use a substantially cheaper data source (e.g., using only random samples for verification, even though learning requires membership queries). We believe that today, when data and data-driven algorithms are quickly gaining prominence, the question of verifying purported outcomes of data analyses is very well-motivated.
		
We show three main results. First, we prove that for a specific hypothesis class, verification is significantly cheaper than learning in terms of the number of random samples required, even if the verifier engages with the prover only in a single-round (NP-like) protocol. Moreover, for this class we prove that single-round verification is also significantly cheaper than testing closeness to the class. Second, for the broad class of Fourier-sparse boolean functions, we show a multi-round (IP-like) verification protocol, where the prover uses membership queries, and the verifier is able to assess the result while only using random samples. Third, we show that verification is not always more efficient. Namely, we show a class of functions where verification requires as many samples as learning does, up to a logarithmic factor.</div>

John Littlewood lived through the 1918–1919 flu pandemic, yet he appears not to have remarked on it in print. Nor can we find mention of it by Godfrey Hardy in <em>A Mathematician’s Apology</em>—though Hardy did write about the ravages of WW I.</p>
<p>
Today, Ken and I thought you might like some fun comments that are not about the current pandemic. </p>
<p>
This is not to say we are ignoring it. We are all fighting the virus in one way or another. Our hearts go out to those of you fighting it directly. We are all worried about ourselves and others. We are stuck at home, at least most of us. We are all in this terrible time together. We hope you all are safe and well. </p>
<p>
We thought we would list a few jokes and stories that you might enjoy. We wrote recently about one kind of mathematical <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/02/28/reductions-and-jokes/">joke</a> that can be given various proportions of pure levity and mathematical content. Our friends Lance Fortnow and Bill Gasarch, plus commenters in their <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2006/06/funniest-computer-science-joke-ever.html">item</a>, collected some jokes on the computer science side.</p>
<p>
Littlewood’s notion of “mathematical joke” leaned more on mathematical content, though his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematician's_Miscellany">memoir</a> <em>A Mathematician’s Miscellany</em> includes many funny stories as well. At the end of his introduction to the book, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A good mathematical joke is better, and better mathematics, than a dozen mediocre papers. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
We will start at the levity end. This is almost a math <a href="http://web.sonoma.edu/Math/faculty/falbo/jokes.html">joke</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The Daily News published a story saying that one-half of the MP (Members of Parliament) were crooks.<br />
The Government took great exception to that and demanded a retraction and an apology.<br />
The newspaper responded the next day with an apology and reported that one-half of the MPs were not crooks. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
We like this one, even if it is not really a hardcore math one. It does rely on the fact that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%3D+1.%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1.}" class="latex" title="{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1.}" /></p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Jokes and More </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The following are some examples that we hope you all like. They are from a variety of sources: </p>
<ul>
<li>
Jokes that mathematicians think are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/13-math-jokes-that-every-mathematician-finds-absolutely-hilarious-2013-5">funny</a>. <p></p>
</li><li>
Some are from <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/3111/funny-tcs-related-papers-etc">StackExchange</a>. <p></p>
</li><li>
Others are from Andrej Cherkaev’s <a href="https://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/mathjokes.html">page</a>.
</li></ul>
<p>We have lightly edited a few.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> “My age is two billion years old,” said Paul Erdös. The point is: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> When I was seventeen years old it was said the earth was two billion years old. Now they say it is four billion years old. So my age is about two billion years old. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> There was a statistician that drowned crossing a river <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /> It was 3 feet deep on average. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> An infinite number of mathematicians walk into a bar. The first one orders a beer. The second orders half a beer. The third orders a third of a beer. The bartender bellows, “Get the heck out of here, are you trying to ruin me?”</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> An chemist, a physicist, and a mathematician are stranded on an island when a can of food rolls ashore. The chemist and the physicist comes up with many ingenious ways to open the can. Then suddenly the mathematician gets a bright idea: “Assume we have a can opener <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" />” </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> A theorist decides she wants to learn more about practical problems. She sees a seminar with the title: “The Theory of Gears.” So she goes. The speaker stands up and begins, “The theory of gears with a finite number of teeth is well known <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /></p>

<p>
Regarding the last one, Littlewood did after all write in his book:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Mathematics is a dangerous profession; an appreciable proportion of us go mad. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
This appears to have been a playful swipe at Hardy’s decision to leave Cambridge for Oxford. It was couched in a discussion of events that would seem to have had tiny probabilities before they happened. </p>
<p>
The last two we’ve picked out from the above sites verge into philosophy:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> The cherry theorem: Question: What is a small, red, round thing that has a cherry pit inside? <br />
Answer: A cherry.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" title="{\bullet}" /> René Descartes went into his favorite bar and the bartender asked, “would you like your usual drink tonight, Monsieur Descartes?” Descartes replied “I think not.” Then he promptly ceased to exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Wrong Derivations, Right Results </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Littlewood’s standards for a “mathematical joke” were higher than ours, but we will start by adapting an example from this MathOverflow <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/38856/jokes-in-the-sense-of-littlewood-examples">discussion</a> of Littlewood-style jokes. Sometimes we can play a joke on ourselves by deriving a result we know is right but with an incorrect proof. Here is the example:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" title="{\bullet}" /> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1bntfg/are_there_or_can_there_be_jokes_or_puns_in/">Casting out 6’s</a>. Suppose we want to simplify the fraction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B166%7D%7B664%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\frac{166}{664}}" class="latex" title="{\frac{166}{664}}" />. We can use the rule of casting out 6’s to get </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B166%7D%7B664%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B16%7D%7B64%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \frac{166}{664} = \frac{16}{64} = \frac{1}{4}. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \frac{166}{664} = \frac{16}{64} = \frac{1}{4}. " /></p>
<p>
The rule works quite generally:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B1666%7D%7B6664%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B16666%7D%7B66664%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B166666%7D%7B666664%7D+%3D+%5Ccdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \frac{1666}{6664} = \frac{16666}{66664} = \frac{166666}{666664} = \cdots " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \frac{1666}{6664} = \frac{16666}{66664} = \frac{166666}{666664} = \cdots " /></p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B26%7D%7B65%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B266%7D%7B665%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B2666%7D%7B6665%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B26666%7D%7B66665%7D+%3D+%5Ccdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \frac{26}{65} = \frac{266}{665} = \frac{2666}{6665} = \frac{26666}{66665} = \cdots " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \frac{26}{65} = \frac{266}{665} = \frac{2666}{6665} = \frac{26666}{66665} = \cdots " /></p>
<p>You can even turn the paper upside down and cast out the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B6%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{6}" class="latex" title="{6}" />‘s that you see then:</p>
<p></p><p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B19%7D%7B95%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B199%7D%7B995%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1999%7D%7B9995%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B19999%7D%7B99995%7D+%3D+%5Ccdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \frac{19}{95} = \frac{199}{995} = \frac{1999}{9995} = \frac{19999}{99995} = \cdots " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \frac{19}{95} = \frac{199}{995} = \frac{1999}{9995} = \frac{19999}{99995} = \cdots " /></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B49%7D%7B98%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B499%7D%7B998%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B4999%7D%7B9998%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B49999%7D%7B99998%7D+%3D+%5Ccdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \frac{49}{98} = \frac{499}{998} = \frac{4999}{9998} = \frac{49999}{99998} = \cdots " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \frac{49}{98} = \frac{499}{998} = \frac{4999}{9998} = \frac{49999}{99998} = \cdots " /></p>
<p>
Note, this is a joke: The rule of course does not actually work all the time: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B56%7D%7B65%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B5%7D%7B5%7D+%3D+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \frac{56}{65} = \frac{5}{5} = 1. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \frac{56}{65} = \frac{5}{5} = 1. " /></p>
<p></p><p><br />
We thought to try to come up with our own examples, or at least blend in other sources. It once struck me (Ken), on reading a column by Martin Gardner on difference equations, that they give a “convincing proof” of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%5E0+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0^0 = 1}" class="latex" title="{0^0 = 1}" />. Consider the powers of a natural number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k}" class="latex" title="{k}" />, say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+%3D+5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k = 5}" class="latex" title="{k = 5}" />. Take differences like so: </p>

<div class="content">
<div style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">One social contribution that I tentatively attribute to Uber is popularisation of the concept of surge pricing. That is, we try to call an Uber and all-too-frequently get told that we have to pay a premium at this particular point in time, due to high demand. On the other hand, recent shortages of toilet paper, paracetamol, and certain foods were not accompanied by any kind of surge pricing, and the limits imposed on how much stuff you can buy, were not so effective in keeping these goods available. At this point, things have improved, although I have not been able to buy flour recently: the shortage of flour in the supermarkets I visit seems to be chronic.<br /><br />Now I appreciate the objection to charging to charging a premium to allcomers, rich and poor alike, in the context of vital food and medicine. (Although, limits on purchases can also be criticised as being unfair to a single purchaser buying for a large family, or a key worker who is short of time and doesn't want to search excessively for a desired item.) In trying to advocate surge pricing, let me turn instead to possible examples less controversial, such as hairdressers and garden centres. When these establishments are allowed to reopen, it seems reasonable that they should charge a premium (temporarily). Not only do they need the money, but it would help to control a flood of customers all causing long queues and infecting each other at close quarters. To be honest, I’m not optimistic that this will happen, since they will still worry about accusations of price-gouging, plus there’s the question of how big a premium is appropriate.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/04/25/the-impossibility-of-measuring-inflation-in-a-pandemic">An article in the Economist</a> highlights a related problem, which is the difficulty of measuring the rate of inflation, at a time when various goods and services (whose prices get used to measure inflation) are unavailable. Coming back to flour, it may be felt that some of it (not all!) should be sold at market price, meaning one that some people will pay, but where it stays on the shelves for a few days, at least. There is a moral case against selling goods too cheaply, which is that it becomes an attempt to hide a problem — a successful attempt, if inflation cannot be measured.<br /><br />Finally, the problem discussed here touches on a defect at the heart of traditional economic theory, which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%E2%80%93Debreu_model">celebrated existence</a> of “correct” prices, unaccompanied by a means of arriving at those prices. The Algorithmic Game Theory community has quite rightly worried about price discovery and its computational obstacles. But the obstacles are also social, and status quo bias plays a big part.</div></div>

Proving super-logarithmic data structure lower bounds in the static \emph{group model} has been a fundamental challenge in computational geometry since the early 80's. We prove a polynomial ($n^{\Omega(1)}$) lower bound for an explicit range counting problem of $n^3$ convex polygons in $\R^2$ (each with $n^{\tilde{O}(1)}$ facets/semialgebraic-complexity), against linear storage arithmetic data structures in the group model. Our construction and analysis are based on a combination of techniques in Diophantine approximation, pseudorandomness, and compressed sensing---in particular, on the existence and partial derandomization of optimal \emph{binary} compressed sensing matrices in the polynomial sparsity regime ($k = n^{1-\delta}$). As a byproduct, this establishes a (logarithmic) separation between compressed sensing matrices and the stronger RIP property.</div>

<div class="content">
The study of branching programs for the Tree Evaluation Problem, introduced by S. Cook et al. (TOCT 2012), remains one of the most promising approaches to separating L from P. Given a label in $[k]$ at each leaf of a complete binary tree and an explicit function  in $[k]^2 \to [k]$ for recursively computing the value of each internal node from its children, the problem is to compute the value at the root node. The problem is parameterized by the alphabet size $k$ and the height $h$ of the tree. A branching program implementing the straightforward recursive algorithm uses $\Theta((k + 1)^h)$ states, organized into $2^h-1$ layers of width up to $k^h$. Until now no better deterministic algorithm was known.

We present a series of three new algorithms solving the Tree Evaluation Problem. They are inspired by the work of Buhrman et al. on catalytic space (STOC 2012), applied outside the catalytic-space setting. First we give a novel branching program with $2^{4h} poly(k)$ layers of width $2^{3k}$, which beats the straightforward algorithm when $h = \omega(k / \log k)$. Next we give a branching program with $k^{2h} poly(k)$ layers of width $k^3$.  This has total size comparable to the straightforward algorithm, but is implemented using the catalytic framework. Finally we interpolate between the two algorithms to give a branching program with $(O(k/h))^{2h} poly(k)$ layers of width $(O(k/h))^{\epsilon h}$ for any constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$, which beats the straightforward algorithm for all $h \geq k^{1/2 + poly(\epsilon)}$. These are the first deterministic branching programs to beat the straightforward algorithm, but more importantly this is the first non-trivial approach to proving deterministic upper bounds for Tree Evaluation.

We also contribute new machinery to the catalytic computing program, which may be of independent interest to some readers.</div>

<p>This blog post concerns our <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07454.pdf">ICLR20 paper</a> on a surprising discovery about learning rate (LR), the most basic hyperparameter in deep learning.</p>

<p>As illustrated in many online blogs, setting LR too small  might slow down the optimization, and setting it too large  might make the network overshoot the area of low losses. The standard mathematical analysis for  the right choice of LR relates it to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothness">smoothness</a> of the loss function.</p>

<p>Many practitioners use a ‘step decay’ LR schedule, which systematically drops the LR after specific training epochs. One often hears the intuition—with some mathematical justification if one treats SGD as a random walk in the  loss landscape— that large learning rates are useful in the initial (“exploration”) phase of training whereas lower rates  in later epochs allow a slow settling down to a local minimum in the landscape. Intriguingly, this intuition is called into  question by the success of exotic learning rate schedules such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03983">cosine</a> (Loshchilov&amp;Hutter, 2016), and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01186">triangular</a> (Smith, 2015), featuring an oscillatory LR.  These divergent approaches suggest that LR, the most basic and intuitive hyperparameter in deep learning, has not revealed all its mysteries yet.</p>

<h1 id="surprise-exponentially-increasing-lr">Surprise: Exponentially increasing LR</h1>

<p>We report experiments that state-of-the-art networks for image recognition tasks can be trained with an exponentially increasing LR (ExpLR): in each iteration it increases by $(1+\alpha)$ for some $\alpha &gt; 0$.  (The $\alpha$ can be varied over epochs.) Here $\alpha$ is not too small in our experiments, so as you would imagine, the LR hits astronomical values in no time.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a rate schedule has been successfully used, let alone for highly successful architectures. In fact, as we will see below, the reason we even did this bizarre experiment  was that we already had a mathematical proof that it would work. Specifically, we could show that such ExpLR schedules are at least as powerful as the standard step-decay ones, by which we mean that ExpLR can let us achieve (in function space) all the nets obtainable via the currently popular step-decay schedules.</p>

<h2 id="so-why-does-this-work">So why does this work?</h2>

<p>One key property of state-of-the-art nets we rely on is that they all use some normalization of parameters within layers, usually Batch Norm (BN), which has been shown to give benefits in optimization and generalization across architectures. Our result also holds for other normalizations, including Group Normalization (Wu &amp; He, 2018), Layer Normalization (Ba et al., 2016), Instance Norm (Ulyanov et al., 2016), etc.</p>

<p>The second key property of current training is that they use weight decay (aka $\ell_2$ regularizer). When combined with BN, this implies strange dynamics in parameter space, and the experimental papers (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05350">van Laarhoven, 2017</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01814">Hoffer et al., 2018a</a> and <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1lz-3Rct7">Zhang et al., 2019</a>),  noticed that combining BN and weight decay can  be viewed as increasing the LR.</p>

<p>Our paper gives a rigorous proof of the power of ExpLR by showing the following about the end-to-end function  being computed (see Main Thm in the paper):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Informal Theorem) For commonly  used values of the paremeters, every net produced by <em>Weight Decay + Constant LR + BN + Momentum</em> can also be produced (in function space) via <em>ExpLR + BN + Momentum</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>*NB: If the LR is not fixed but decaying in discrete steps, then the equivalent ExpLR training decays the exponent. (See our paper for details.)</p>

<p>At first sight such a claim may seem difficult (if not impossible) to prove given that we lack any mathematical characterization of nets produced by training (note that the theorem makes no mention of the dataset!).  The  equivalence is shown by reasoning about <em>trajectory</em> of optimization, instead of the usual “landscape view” of stationary points, gradient norms, Hessian norms, smoothness, etc.. This is an example of the importance of trajectory analysis, as argued in <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2019/06/03/trajectories/">earlier blog post of Sanjeev’s</a> because optimization and generalization are deeply intertwined for deep learning. Conventional wisdom says LR controls optimization, and the regularizer controls generalization. Our result shows that the effect of weight decay can  under fairly normal conditions be * exactly*  realized by the ExpLR rate schedule.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
<p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Training PreResNet32 on CIFAR10 with fixed LR $0.1$, momentum $0.9$ and other standard hyperparameters. Trajectory was unchanged when WD was turned off  and LR at iteration $t$ was $\tilde{\eta}_ t = 0.1\times1.481^t$. (The constant $1.481$ is predicted by our theory given the original hyperparameters.) Plot on right shows  weight norm $\pmb{w}$ of the first convolutional layer in the second residual block. It grows exponentially as one would expect, satisfying $|\pmb{w}_ t|_ 2^2/\tilde{\eta}_ t = $ constant.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.offconvex.org/feed.xml# (We first want to clarify that the exponential LR schedules work for normalized networks only and will lead parameter and output explosion for networks without normalization. )">comment</a>:# (In the rest of the post, we will first explain how does this equivalence result arises from various types of normalization schemes and then sketch the proof. We will also present a more general exponential growing learning schedule called ‘'’Tapered Exponential Learning Rate Schedule’, or TEXP, which is both experimentally and theoretically equivalent to the standard Step Decay schedule + Weight Decay. )</p>

<h2 id="scale-invariance-and-equivalence">Scale Invariance and Equivalence</h2>

<p>The formal proof holds for any training loss satisfying 
what we call <em>Scale Invariance</em>:</p>



<p>BN and other normalization schemes result in a Scale-Invariant Loss for the popular deep architectures (Convnet, Resnet, DenseNet etc.) if the output layer –where normally no normalization is used– is fixed throughout training. Empirically, <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1Dh8Tg0-">Hoffer et al. (2018b)</a>  found that randomly fixing the output layer at the start does not harm the final accuracy. 
(Appendix C of our paper demonstrates scale invariance for  various architectures; it is somewhat nontrivial.)</p>

<p>For batch ${\mathcal{B}} = \{ x_ i \} _ {i=1}^B$, network parameter ${\pmb{\theta}}$, we  denote the network by $f_ {\pmb{\theta}}$ and the loss function at iteration $t$ by $L_ t(f_ {\pmb{\theta}}) = L(f_ {\pmb{\theta}}, {\mathcal{B}}_ t)$ . We also use $L_ t({\pmb{\theta}})$ for convenience. We say the network $f_ {\pmb{\theta}}$ is <em>scale invariant</em> if $\forall c&gt;0$, $f_ {c{\pmb{\theta}}} = f_ {\pmb{\theta}}$, which implies the loss $L_ t$ is also scale invariant, i.e., $L_  t(c{\pmb{\theta}}_ t)=L_ t({\pmb{\theta}}_ t)$, $\forall c&gt;0$. A key source of intuition is the following lemma provable via chain rule:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Lemma 1</strong>. A scale-invariant loss $L$ satisfies
(1). $\langle\nabla_ {\pmb{\theta}} L, {\pmb{\theta}} \rangle=0$ ;<br />
(2). $\left.\nabla_ {\pmb{\theta}} L \right|_ {\pmb{\theta} = \pmb{\theta}_ 0} = c \left.\nabla_ {\pmb{\theta}} L\right|_  {\pmb{\theta} = c\pmb{\theta}_ 0}$, for any $c&gt;0$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first property immediately implies that $|{\pmb{\theta}}_ t|$ is monotone increasing for SGD if WD is turned off by Pythagoren Theorem. And based on this, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.03981.pdf">our previous work</a> with Kaifeng Lyu shows that GD with any fixed learning rate can reach $\varepsilon$ approximate stationary point for scale invariant objectives in $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$ iterations.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

<br />
<b>Figure 3.</b> Illustration of Lemma 1. 
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Below is the main result of the paper. We will explain the proof idea (using scale-invariance) in a later post.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 1(Main, Informal).</strong> SGD on a scale-invariant objective with initial learning rate $\eta$, weight decay factor $\lambda$, and momentum factor $\gamma$ is equivalent to SGD with momentum factor $\gamma$ where at iteration $t$, the ExpLR $\tilde{\eta}_ t$  is defined as $\tilde{\eta}_ t = \alpha^{-2t-1} \eta$ without weight decay($\tilde{\lambda} = 0$) where $\alpha$ is a non-zero root of equation 
     </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Specifically, when momentum $\gamma=0$,  the above schedule can be simplified as $\tilde{\eta}_ t = (1-\lambda\eta)^{-2t-1} \eta$.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="sota-performance-with-exponential-lr">SOTA performance with exponential LR</h3>

<p>As mentioned, reaching state-of-the-art accuracy  requires reducing the learning rate a few times. Suppose the training has $K$ phases, and the learning rate is divided by some constant $C_I&gt;1$ when entering phase $I$. To realize the same effect with an exponentially increasing LR, we have:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 2:</strong> ExpLR with the below modification generates the same network sequence as Step Decay with momentum factor $\gamma$ and WD $\lambda$ does. We call it <em>Tapered Exponential LR schedule</em> (TEXP).<br />
<strong>Modification when entering a new phase $I$</strong>: (1). switching to some smaller exponential growing rate; (2). divinding the current LR by $C_I$.</p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<p><strong>Figure 5.</strong> PreResNet32 trained with Step Decay (as in Figure 1) and its corresponding TEXP schedule. As predicted by Theorem 2, they have similar trajectories and performances.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>We hope that this bit of theory and supporting experiments have changed your outlook on learning rates for deep learning.</p>

<p>As if we didn’t have enough to worry us, this week brought the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/googles-head-quantum-computing-hardware-resigns/">sad news</a> that John Martinis, who for five years was the leader and public face of Google’s experimental quantum computing effort, has quit Google and returned to his earlier post at UC Santa Barbara.  I’ve spoken about what happened both with John and with Hartmut Neven, the head of Google’s Quantum AI Lab.  Without betraying confidences, or asserting anything that either side would disagree with, I think I can say that it came down to a difference in management philosophies.  Google tends to be consensus-driven, whereas John is of the view that building a million-qubit, error-corrected quantum computer will take more decisive leadership.  I can add: I’d often wondered how John had time to travel the world, giving talks about quantum supremacy, while also managing the lab’s decisions on a day-to-day basis.  It looks now like I was right to wonder!  Potential analogies flood the mind: is this like a rock band that breaks up right after its breakout hit?  Is it like Steve Jobs leaving Apple?  Anyway, I wish the Google team the best in John’s absence, and I also wish John the best with whatever he does next.</p>



<p>I was never big on HBO (e.g., I still haven’t seen a single minute of <em>Game of Thrones</em>), but in the last couple of weeks, Dana and I found ourselves watching two absolutely compelling HBO shows—one a fictional miniseries and the other a documentary, but both on the theme of the fragility of American democracy.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.hbo.com/the-plot-against-america"><em>The Plot Against America</em></a>, based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plot_Against_America">2004 Philip Roth novel</a> of the same name (which Dana read and which I now plan to read), is about an alternate history where the aviator Charles Lindbergh defeats FDR in the 1940 presidential election, on a fascist and isolationist platform, in events that—as countless people have pointed out—are eerily, terrifyingly prescient of what would actualy befall the US in 2016.  The series follows a Jewish insurance salesman and his family in Newark, NJ—isn’t that what it always is with Philip Roth?—as they try to cope with the country’s gradual, all-too-plausible slide downward, from the genteel antisemitism that already existed in <em>our</em> timeline’s 1940 all the way to riots, assassinations, and pogroms (although never to an American Holocaust).  One of the series’ final images is of paper ballots, in a rematch presidential election, being carted away and burned, underscoring just how much depends here on the mundane machinery of democracy.</p>



<p>Which brings me to <a href="https://www.hbo.com/documentaries/kill-chain-the-cyber-war-on-americas-elections"><em>Kill Chain: The Cyber War on America’s Elections</em></a>, a documentary about the jaw-droppingly hackable electronic voting machines used in US elections and the fight to do something about them.  The show mostly follows the journey of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harri_Hursti">Harri Hursti</a>, a Finnish-born programmer who’s made this issue his life’s work, but it also extensively features my childhood best friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Halderman">Alex Halderman</a>.  OK, but isn’t this a theoretical issue, one that (perhaps rightly) exercises security nerds like Alex, but surely hasn’t changed the outcomes of actual elections?</p>



<p>Yeah, so about that.  You know Brian Kemp, the doofus governor of Georgia, who’s infamously announced plans to reopen the state right away, ignoring the pleading of public health experts—a  act that will fill Georgia’s ICUs and morgues as surely as night follows day?  And you know how Kemp defeated the Democrat, Stacey Abrams, by a razor-thin margin, in a 2018 election of which Kemp himself was the overseer?  It turns out that Kemp’s office distributed defective memory cards to African-American and Democratic precincts, though not to white and Republican ones.  There’s also striking statistical evidence that at least some voting machines were hacked, although because there was no paper trail it can never be proved.</p>



<p>In short, what <em>The Plot Against America</em> and <em>Kill Chain</em> have in common is that they <em>would be</em> desperately needed warnings about the ease with which democracy could collapse in the US, except for the detail that much of what they warn about has already happened, and now it’s not clear how we get back.</p></div>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: Adaptive sampling is a useful algorithmic tool for data summarization problems in the classical centralized setting, where the entire dataset is available to the single processor performing the computation. Adaptive sampling repeatedly selects rows of an underlying <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="d" class="latex" title="d" /> matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="A" class="latex" title="A" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cgg+d&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="n \gg d" class="latex" title="n \gg d" />, with probabilities proportional to their distances to the subspace of the previously selected rows. Intuitively, adaptive sampling seems to be limited to trivial multi-pass algorithms in the streaming model of computation due to its inherently sequential nature of assigning sampling probabilities to each row only after the previous iteration is completed. Surprisingly, we show this is not the case by giving the first one-pass algorithms for adaptive sampling on turnstile streams and using space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7Bpoly%7D%28d%2Ck%2C%5Clog+n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="\text{poly}(d,k,\log n)" class="latex" title="\text{poly}(d,k,\log n)" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" /> is the number of adaptive sampling rounds to be performed.</p>
<p>Our adaptive sampling procedure has a number of applications to various data summarization problems on turnstile streams that either improve state-of-the-art or have only been previously studied in the more relaxed row-arrival model. This includes column subset selection, subspace approximation, projective clustering, and volume maximization. We complement our volume maximization algorithmic results with lower bounds that are tight up to lower order terms, even for multi-pass algorithms. By a similar construction, we also obtain lower bounds for volume maximization in the row-arrival model, which we match with competitive upper bounds.</p>
<p>This is a joint work with Ilya Razenshteyn, David Woodruff, and Samson Zhou.</p></blockquote></div>

In this work we study bounded collusion protocols (BCPs) recently introduced in the context of secret sharing by Kumar, Meka, and Sahai (FOCS 2019). These are multi-party communication protocols on $n$ parties where in each round a subset of $p$-parties (the collusion bound) collude together and write a function of their inputs on a public blackboard. 

BCPs interpolate elegantly between the well-studied number-in-hand (NIH) model ($p=1$) and the number-on-forehead (NOF) model ($p=n-1$). Motivated by questions in communication complexity, secret sharing, and pseudorandomness we investigate BCPs more thoroughly answering several questions about them. 

* We prove a polynomial (in the input-length) lower bound for an explicit function against BCPs where any constant fraction of players can collude. Previously, non-trivial lower bounds were only known when the collusion bound was at most logarithmic in the input-length (owing to bottlenecks in NOF lower bounds). 

* For all $t \leq n$, we construct efficient $t$-out-of-$n$ secret sharing schemes where the secret remains hidden even given the transcript of a BCP with collusion bound $O(t/\log t)$. Prior work could only handle collusions of size $O(\log n)$. Along the way, we construct leakage-resilient schemes against disjoint and adaptive leakage,  resolving a question asked by Goyal and Kumar (STOC 2018).

* An explicit $n$-source cylinder intersection extractor whose output is close to uniform even when given the transcript of a BCP with a constant fraction of parties colluding. The min-entropy rate we require is $0.3$ (independent of collusion bound $p \ll n$). 

Our results rely on a new class of exponential sums that interpolate between the ones considered in additive combinatorics by Bourgain (Geometric and Functional Analysis 2009) and Petridis and Shparlinski (Journal d'Analyse Mathématique 2019).</div>

Starting with the two standard model of randomized communication complexity, we study the communication complexity of functions when the protocol has access to a defective source of randomness. 
Specifically, we consider both the public-randomness and private-randomness cases, while replacing the commonly postulated perfect randomness with distributions over $\ell$ bit strings that have min-entropy at least $k\leq\ell$. 
We present general upper and lower bounds on the communication complexity in these cases, where the bounds are typically linear in $\ell-k$ and also depend on the size of the fooling set for the function being computed and on its standard randomized complexity.</div>

<p><i>(This blog post is based on joint work with </i><a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~dkogan/"><i>Dima Kogan</i></a><i>.)</i></p>
<p>One of the great unsung perks of being a college student is having access to the university library. There is something thrilling about hunting down exactly the right reference deep in the stacks, or reading through the archived papers of a public figure from years back.</p>
<p>The pandemic has closed all of our libraries for the time being. Even so, through the fruits of computer science—databases, the Internet, e-readers, and so on—we can get access to much of the same information even when we are cooped up at home.</p>
<p>But for me, one of the true pleasures of using a library is the fact that I can browse through any book I want in complete privacy. If I want to go up to the stacks and read about tulip gardening, or road-bike maintenance, or strategies for managing anxiety, I can do that pretty much without anyone else knowing.</p>
<p>In contrast, if I go online today and search for “tulip gardening,” Google will take careful note of my interest in tulips and I will be seeing ads about gardening tools for months.</p>
<p>An ideal digital library would let us download and read books without anyone—not even the library itself—learning which books we are reading. How could we build such a privacy-respecting digital library?</p>
<p>In this post, we will discuss the private-library problem and how <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1075">our recent work on private information retrieval</a> might be able to help solve it.</p>
<h3><b>The Private-Library Problem</b></h3>
<p>Let us define the problem a little more precisely. We will imagine a protocol running between a library, which holds the books, and a student, who wants to download a particular book.</p>
<p>Say that the library has <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="N" class="latex" title="N" /> books—let’s call the books <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%28x_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x=(x_1, \dots, x_N)" class="latex" title="x=(x_1, \dots, x_N)" />. To keep things simple, let’s pretend that each book consists of just a single bit of information, so <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i+%5Cin+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x_i \in \{0,1\}" class="latex" title="x_i \in \{0,1\}" /> for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cin+%5C%7B1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}" class="latex" title="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}" />.</p>
<p>The student starts out holding the index <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cin+%5C%7B1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}" class="latex" title="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}" /> of her desired book. To fetch the digital book from the library, the student and library exchange some messages. At the end of the interaction, we want the following two properties to hold:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Correctness.</b> The student should have her desired book (i.e., the bit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x_i" class="latex" title="x_i" />).</li>
<li><b>Privacy. </b>The library should have not learned any information, in a cryptographic sense, about which book the student downloaded.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, we have grossly simplified the problem: a real book is more than a single bit in length, book titles are not consecutive integers, maybe the student would like to find a book using a keyword search, etc. But even this simplified private-information-retrieval problem, which <a href="http://www.tau.ac.il/~bchor/PIR.pdf">Chor, Goldreich, Kushilevitz, and Sudan introduced</a> in the 90s, is already interesting enough.</p>
<h3><b>A simple but inefficient solution</b></h3>
<p>There is a simple solution to this problem: the student can just ask the library to send her the contents of all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="N" class="latex" title="N" /> books. This solution achieves both correctness and privacy, so what’s the problem? Are we done?</p>
<p>Well, there are two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>The amount of <b>communication</b> is large: Just to read a single book, the client must download the contents of the entire library! So this is terribly inefficient.</li>
<li>The amount of <b>computation</b> is large: Just to fetch a single book, the library must do work proportional to the size of the entire library. So “checking out” a book from this digital library will take a long time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Research on private information retrieval typically focuses on the first problem: how can we reduce the <i>communication</i> cost? Using a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2968443">variety</a> of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/646125">clever</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2976749.2978429">techniques</a>, it is possible to drive down the communication cost to something very small—sub-polynomial or even logarithmic in the library size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="N" class="latex" title="N" />.</p>
<p>But today we are interested in the <i>computational</i> burden on the library. Is there any way that the student can privately download a book from the library while requiring the library to do only <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%28N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="o(N)" class="latex" title="o(N)" /> work in the process?</p>
<h3><b>Doing the hard work in advance</b></h3>
<p>To have both correctness and privacy, it seems that the library needs to touch each of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="N" class="latex" title="N" /> books in the process of responding to each student’s request. And, in some sense, <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cis/pubs/malkin/BIM.ps">this is true</a>. So, to allow the library to run in time sublinear in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="N" class="latex" title="N" />, we will have to tweak the problem slightly.</p>
<p>Our idea is to have the library do the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="O(N)" class="latex" title="O(N)" />-time computation in an <b>offline phase</b>, which takes place <i>before</i> the student decides which book she wants to read. For example, this offline phase might happen overnight while the library’s servers would otherwise be idle.</p>
<p>Later on, once the student decides which book in the library she wants to read, the student and library can run a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%28N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="o(N)" class="latex" title="o(N)" />-time <b>online phase</b> in which the student is able to retrieve her desired book. The total communication cost, in both offline and online phases, will be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%28N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="o(N)" class="latex" title="o(N)" />.</p>
<p>So, by pushing the library’s expensive linear scan to an offline phase, the library can service the student’s request for a book in sublinear online time.</p>
<h3><b>Our offline/online private information retrieval scheme</b></h3>
<p>Let’s see how to construct such an offline/online scheme. To make things simple for the purposes of this post, let’s assume that the student has access to two non-colluding libraries that hold the same set of books. To be concrete, let’s call the two libraries “Stanford” and “Berkeley.”</p>
<p>The privacy property will hold as long as the librarians at Stanford and Berkeley don’t get together and share the information that they learned while running the protocol with the student. So Stanford and Berkeley here are “non-colluding.” (Equivalently, our scheme that protects privacy against an adversary that controls one of the two libraries—but not both.)</p>
<div style="width: 571px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1670"><img width="561" alt="Offline-online PIR" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/offlineonline.png?w=561&amp;h=365" class=" wp-image-1670" height="365" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1670">In the offline phase, which happens before the student knows which book she wants to read, the Stanford library does linear work. In the online phase, which runs once the student has the index of her desired book, the Berkeley library runs in sublinear time. (We are suppressing log factors here.)</p></div>
<p>Now, let’s describe an offline/online protocol by which the student can privately fetch a book from the digital library:</p>
<p><b>Offline Phase.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The student partitions the integers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B1%2C+..%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\{1, .., N\}" class="latex" title="\{1, .., N\}" /> into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\sqrt{N}" class="latex" title="\sqrt{N}" /> non-overlapping sets chosen at random, where each set has size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\sqrt{N}" class="latex" title="\sqrt{N}" />. Call these sets <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+S_%7B%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S_1, \dots, S_{\sqrt{N}}" class="latex" title="S_1, \dots, S_{\sqrt{N}}" />.</li>
<li>The student sends these sets <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+S_%7B%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S_1, \dots, S_{\sqrt{N}}" class="latex" title="S_1, \dots, S_{\sqrt{N}}" /> to Stanford (the first library). To reduce the communication cost here, the student can compress these sets using pseudorandomness.</li>
<li>For each set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S_j" class="latex" title="S_j" />, the Stanford library computes the <i>parity</i> of all of the books indexed by set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S_j" class="latex" title="S_j" /> and returns the parity bits <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28b_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+b_%7B%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="(b_1, \dots, b_{\sqrt{N}})" class="latex" title="(b_1, \dots, b_{\sqrt{N}})" /> to the student. In other words, if the books are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D%28x_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+x_N%29+%5Cin+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="x=(x_1, \dots, x_N) \in \{0,1\}^n" class="latex" title="x=(x_1, \dots, x_N) \in \{0,1\}^n" />, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_j+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bk+%5Cin+S_j%7D+x_k+%5Cbmod+2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="b_j = \sum_{k \in S_j} x_k \bmod 2" class="latex" title="b_j = \sum_{k \in S_j} x_k \bmod 2" />.</li>
</ul>
<p>The total communication in this phase is only <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="O(\sqrt{N})" class="latex" title="O(\sqrt{N})" /> bits and the student and the Stanford library can run this step <i>before</i> the student decides which book she wants to read.</p>
<p><b>Online Phase.</b> Once the student decides that she wants to read book <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cin+%5C%7B1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}" class="latex" title="i \in \{1, \dots, N\}" />, the student and Berkeley (the second library) run the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>The student finds the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S_j" class="latex" title="S_j" /> that contains the index <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" /> of her desired book.</li>
<li>The student flips a coin that is weighted to come up heads with some probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="p" class="latex" title="p" />, to be fixed later.</li>
<li>If the coin lands <span style="text-decoration: underline;">heads</span>:
<ul>
<li>The student sends <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%5Cgets+S_j+%5Csetminus+%5C%7Bi%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S \gets S_j \setminus \{i\}" class="latex" title="S \gets S_j \setminus \{i\}" /> to the Berkeley library.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the coin lands <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tails</span>:
<ul>
<li>The student samples <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%27+%5Cgets_R+S_j+%5Csetminus+%5C%7Bi%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i' \gets_R S_j \setminus \{i\}" class="latex" title="i' \gets_R S_j \setminus \{i\}" />.</li>
<li>The student sends <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%5Cgets+S_j+%5Csetminus+%5C%7Bi%27%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S \gets S_j \setminus \{i'\}" class="latex" title="S \gets S_j \setminus \{i'\}" /> to the Berkeley library.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Berkeley library receives the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%5Csubseteq+%5C%7B1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S \subseteq \{1, \dots, N\}" class="latex" title="S \subseteq \{1, \dots, N\}" /> from the student. The Berkeley library returns the contents of all books whose indices appear in set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> to the student.</li>
<li>Now, the student can recover its desired book as follows:
<ul>
<li>If <span style="text-decoration: underline;">heads</span>: the student now has the parity of the books in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S_j" class="latex" title="S_j" /> (from the offline phase) and the value of all books in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S_j" class="latex" title="S_j" /> that are not book <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" />. This is enough to recover the contents of book <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" />.</li>
<li>If <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tails</span>: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cin+S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i \in S" class="latex" title="i \in S" />. In this case the Berkeley library has sent the contents of book <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" /> to the student in the online phase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even before we fix the weight <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="p" class="latex" title="p" /> of the coin, we see that the protocol satisfies <b>correctness</b>, since no matter how the coin lands the client recovers its desired book. Also, the total communication cost is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BN%7D+%5Clog+N%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="O(\sqrt{N} \log N)" class="latex" title="O(\sqrt{N} \log N)" /> bits, which is sublinear as we had hoped. Finally, the <b>online computation cost</b> is also sublinear: the Berkeley library just needs to return <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\sqrt{N}" class="latex" title="\sqrt{N}" /> books to the client, which it can do in time roughly <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7BN%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="O(\sqrt{N})" class="latex" title="O(\sqrt{N})" />.</p>
<p>The last matter to address is <b>privacy</b>. Again, we are assuming that the adversary controls only one of the two libraries.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the offline phase, the student’s message to the Stanford library is independent of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" />, so the protocol is perfectly private with respect to Stanford.</li>
<li>In the online phase, we must be more careful. It turns out that if we choose the weight <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="p" class="latex" title="p" /> of the coin as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3D+1+-+%28%5Csqrt%7BN%7D+-+1%29%2FN&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="p = 1 - (\sqrt{N} - 1)/N" class="latex" title="p = 1 - (\sqrt{N} - 1)/N" />, then the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> that the student sends to UC Berkeley in the online phase is just a uniformly random size-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Csqrt%7BN%7D-1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="(\sqrt{N}-1)" class="latex" title="(\sqrt{N}-1)" /> subset of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+N%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\{1, \dots, N\}" class="latex" title="\{1, \dots, N\}" />.</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Open problems</b></h3>
<p>So, the student can privately fetch a book from our digital libraries in sublinear online time. What else is left to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting rid of the need for two non-colluding libraries is a clear next step. <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1075">Our work</a> has some results along these lines, but they pay a price either in (a) asymptotic efficiency or in (b) the strength of the cryptographic assumptions required.</li>
<li>A beautiful paper of <a href="https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~beimel/Papers/BIM.pdf">Beimel, Ishai, and Malkin</a> shows that if the library can store its collection of books using a special type of error-correcting encoding, the <b>total</b> computational time at the libraries (not just the online time) can be sublinear in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="N" class="latex" title="N" />. As far as we know, these schemes are not concretely efficient enough to use in practice. Could they be made so?</li>
<li>Privacy is just one of the many pleasures of using a physical library. During this period of confinement, I also miss the smell of the books, the beauty of light filtering through the stacks, and the peacefulness of thinking in a study carrel. Can a digital library ever give us these things too?</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these questions catch your fancy, please check out <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1075">our Eurocrypt paper</a> for more background, pointers, and results.</p>
<p>Don Knuth <a href="http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf">has reportedly said</a> “Using a great library to solve a specific problem… Now <i>that</i> […] is real living.” With better digital libraries, maybe we could all live a little bit more during these challenging days.</p></div>

<p>As many of you have probably anticipated, due to concerns regarding the novel coronavirus COVID-19, the <a href="http://ec20.sigecom.org/">2020 ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC 2020)</a> will be held virtually.</p>
<p>This change of format will of course present us with difficult challenges, but we believe it will offer exciting new opportunities as well.  (And not to worry, your opportunity to attend EC in Budapest is just deferred to 2021.)</p>
<p>The <a href="http://sigecom.org/officers.html">SIGecom Executive Committee</a> has appointed and will serve on a Virtual Transition Team that additionally includes the following new conference officers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual General Chair: <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartline/">Jason Hartline</a></li>
<li>Virtual Local Chair: <a href="https://yannai.gonch.name/">Yannai Gonczarowski</a></li>
<li>Virtual Global Outreach Chairs: <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~red/">Rediet Abebe</a> and <a href="https://research.fb.com/people/sodomka-eric/">Eric Sodomka</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This team is working with the <a href="http://ec20.sigecom.org/committees-acm/organizing-committee/">EC 2020 organizing committee</a> and <a href="http://ec20.sigecom.org/committees-acm/program-committee/">EC 2020 PC chairs</a> to put together a plan that leverages the opportunities of the virtual format to the fullest extent. Though these plans are still in the works, we have identified the following “minimal commitment” for authors of accepted papers to the main EC conference: at least one author will need to</p>
<ul>
<li>register for the conference;</li>
<li>be available virtually on the conference dates (July 14-16);</li>
<li>provide a camera-ready paper or abstract by the camera-ready deadline;</li>
<li>provide a pre-recorded talk presenting the paper two weeks in advance (by June 28).</li>
</ul>
<p>We are optimistic that, while a virtual EC may lack some of the positive features of a classical conference, the format will also provide opportunities that improve on the classical experience.  As with any conference there will be opportunities to participate beyond the “minimal commitment.”  We hope that speakers and participants will join in other activities, which may include preview sessions for talks before the conference proper, watch parties for speakers and attendees, and mechanisms for reaching a wider audience with the technical program. With many academic interactions moving virtual, the barriers to collaboration with distant colleagues have lowered, and we hope that EC 2020 will kindle and rekindle global collaborations.</p>
<div>
<p>Further details about these activities as well as the minimal requirements will be circulated by June 1.</p>
<p>Tutorial speakers and workshop organizers will receive separate emails from the Tutorial and Workshop Chairs about plans for moving these events online.</p>

<p>The second part of our brief survey of differentially private statistics. This time, we show how to privately estimate the CDF of a distribution (i.e., estimate the distribution in Kolmogorov distance), and conclude with pointers to some other work in the space.</p>
<p>The first part of this series is <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/2020/04/14/a-primer-on-private-statistics-part-i/">here</a>, and you can download both parts in PDF form <a href="http://www.gautamkamath.com/writings/primer.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>1. CDF Estimation for Discrete, Univariate Distributions </b></p>
<p>Suppose we have a distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> over the ordered, discrete domain <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B1%2C%5Cdots%2CD%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\{1,\dots,D\}}" class="latex" title="{\{1,\dots,D\}}" /> and let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathcal{P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathcal{P}}" /> be the family of all such distributions. The CDF of the distribution is the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi_%7BP%7D+%3A+%5C%7B1%2C%5Cdots%2CD%5C%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5B0%2C1%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\Phi_{P} : \{1,\dots,D\} \rightarrow [0,1]}" class="latex" title="{\Phi_{P} : \{1,\dots,D\} \rightarrow [0,1]}" /> given by</p>

<p>A natural measure of distance between CDFs is the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell_%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\ell_\infty}" class="latex" title="{\ell_\infty}" /> distance, as this is the sort of convergence guarantee that the empirical CDF satisfies. That is, in the non-private setting, the empirical CDF will achieve the minimax rate, which it known by [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DKW56">DKW56</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#Mas90">Mas90</a>] to be <a name="eqdkw"></a></p>

<p>Thus, we can use the Gaussian mechanism:</p>

<p>As we will argue, there exists a matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Cin+%7B%5Cmathbb+R%7D%5E%7B2D+%5Ctimes+2D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A \in {\mathbb R}^{2D \times 2D}}" class="latex" title="{A \in {\mathbb R}^{2D \times 2D}}" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi_%7BX%7D+%3D+A+%5Ccdot+f%28X_%7B1+%5Ccdots+n%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\Phi_{X} = A \cdot f(X_{1 \cdots n})}" class="latex" title="{\Phi_{X} = A \cdot f(X_{1 \cdots n})}" />.

Since differential privacy is closed under post-processing, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M}" class="latex" title="{M}" /> inherits the privacy of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M'}" class="latex" title="{M'}" />.</p>
<p>We will now show how to construct the matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> and analyze the error of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M}" class="latex" title="{M}" />.

<p>See the following diagram for a visual representation of the decomposition.</p>

<p>This shows hierarchical decomposition of the domain <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B1%2C%5Cdots%2C8%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\{1,\dots,8\}}" class="latex" title="{\{1,\dots,8\}}" /> using 14 intervals.

<p><b> 1.2. Why Restrict the Domain? </b></p>
<p>A drawback of the estimator we constructed is that it only applies to distributions of finite support <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B1%2C2%2C%5Cdots%2CD%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\{1,2,\dots,D\}}" class="latex" title="{\{1,2,\dots,D\}}" />, albeit with a relatively mild dependence on the support size. If privacy isn’t a concern, then no such restriction is necessary, as the bound <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#eqdkw">(2)</a> applies equally well to any distribution over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathbb+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{{\mathbb R}}" class="latex" title="{{\mathbb R}}" />. Can we construct a differentially private estimator for distributions with infinite support?</p>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly, the answer to this question is no! Any differentially private estimator for the CDF of the distribution has to have a rate that depends on the support size, and cannot give non-trivial rates for distributions with infinite support.</p>

<p>The notation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog%5E%2A+D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\log^* D}" class="latex" title="{\log^* D}" /> refers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_logarithm">iterated logarithm</a>.</p>
<p>We emphasize that this theorem shouldn’t meet with too much alarm, as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog%5E%2A+D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\log^* D}" class="latex" title="{\log^* D}" /> grows remarkably slowly with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{D}" class="latex" title="{D}" />. There are differentially private CDF estimators that achieve very mild dependence on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{D}" class="latex" title="{D}" /> [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BNS13">BNS13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BNSV15">BNSV15</a>], including one nearly matching the lower bound in Theorem <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#thmcdf-lb">2</a>. Moreover, if we want to estimate a distribution over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathbb+R%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{{\mathbb R}}" class="latex" title="{{\mathbb R}}" />, and are willing to make some mild regularity conditions on the distribution, then we can approximate it by a distribution with finite support and only increase the rate slightly. However, what Theorem <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#thmcdf-lb">2</a> shows is that there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution to private CDF estimation that achieves similar guarantees to the empirical CDF. That is, the right algorithm has to be tailored somewhat to the application and the assumptions we can make about the distribution.</p>
<p><b>2. More Private Statistics </b></p>
<p>Of course, the story doesn’t end here! There’s a whole wide world of differentially private statistics beyond what we’ve mentioned already. We proceed to survey just a few other directions of study in private statistics.</p>
<p><b> 2.1. Parameter and Distribution Estimation </b></p>
<p>A number of the early works in differential privacy give methods for differentially private statistical estimation for i.i.d. data. The earliest works [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DN03">DN03</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DN04">DN04</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BDMN05">BDMN05</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DMNS06">DMNS06</a>], which introduced the Gaussian mechanism, among other foundational results, can be thought of as methods for estimating the mean of a distribution over the hypercube <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\{0,1\}^d}" class="latex" title="{\{0,1\}^d}" /> in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell_%5Cinfty%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\ell_\infty}" class="latex" title="{\ell_\infty}" /> norm. Tight lower bounds for this problem follow from the tracing attacks introduced in [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BUV14">BUV14</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DSSUV15">DSSUV15</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BSU17">BSU17</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU17a">SU17a</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU17b">SU17b</a>]. A very recent work of Acharya, Sun, and Zhang [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ASZ20">ASZ20</a>] adapts classical tools for proving estimation and testing lower bounds (lemmata of Assouad, Fano, and Le Cam) to the differentially private setting. Steinke and Ullman [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU17b">SU17b</a>] give tight minimax lower bounds for the weaker guarantee of selecting the largest coordinates of the mean, which were refined by Cai, Wang, and Zhang [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CWZ19">CWZ19</a>] to give lower bounds for sparse mean-estimation problems.</p>
<p>Nissim, Raskhodnikova, and Smith introduced the highly general sample-and-aggregate paradigm, which they apply to several learning problems (e.g., learning mixtures of Gaussians) [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#NRS07">NRS07</a>]. Later, Smith [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#Smi11">Smi11</a>] showed that this paradigm can be used to transform any estimator for any asymptotically normal, univariate statistic over a bounded data domain into a differentially private one with the same asymptotic convergence rate.</p>
<p>Subsequent work has focused on both relaxing the assumptions in [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#Smi11">Smi11</a>], particularly boundedness, and on giving finite-sample guarantees. Karwa and Vadhan investigated the problem of Gaussian mean estimation, proving the first near-optimal bounds for this setting [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KV18">KV18</a>]. In particular, exploiting concentration properties of Gaussian data allows us to achieve non-trivial results even with unbounded data, which is impossible in general. Following this, Kamath, Li, Singhal, and Ullman moved to the multivariate setting, investigating the estimation of Gaussians and binary product distributions in total variation distance [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KLSU19">KLSU19</a>]. In certain cases (i.e., Gaussians with identity covariance), this is equivalent to mean estimation in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\ell_2}" class="latex" title="{\ell_2}" />-distance, though not always. For example, for binary product distribution, one must estimate the mean in a type of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cchi%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\chi^2}" class="latex" title="{\chi^2}" />-distance instead. The perspective of distribution estimation rather than parameter estimation can be valuable. Bun, Kamath, Steinke, and Wu [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BKSW19">BKSW19</a>] develop a primitive for private hypothesis selection, which they apply to learn any coverable class of distributions under pure differential privacy. Through the lens of distribution estimation, their work implies an upper bound for mean estimation of binary product distributions that bypasses lower bounds for the same problem in the empirical setting. In addition to work on mean estimation in the sub-Gaussian setting, such as the results discussed earlier, mean estimation has also been studied under weaker moment conditions [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BS19">BS19</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KSU20">KSU20</a>]. Beyond these settings, there has also been study of estimation of discrete multinomials, including estimation in Kolmogorov distance [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BNSV15">BNSV15</a>] and in total variation distance for structured distributions [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DHS15">DHS15</a>], and parameter estimation of Markov Random Fields [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ZKKW20">ZKKW20</a>].</p>
<p>A different approach to constructing differentially private estimators is based on robust statistics. This approah begins with the influential work of Dwork and Lei [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DL09">DL09</a>], which introduced the propose-test-release framework, and applied to estimating robust statistics such as the median and interquartile range. While the definitions in robust statistics and differential privacy are semantically similar, formal connections between the two remain relatively scant, which suggests a productive area for future study.</p>
<p><b> 2.2. Hypothesis Testing </b></p>
<p>An influential work of Homer et al. [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#HSRDTMPSNC08">HSRDTMPSNC08</a>] demonstrated the vulnerability of classical statistics in a genomic setting, showing that certain <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cchi%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\chi^2}" class="latex" title="{\chi^2}" />-statistics on many different variables could allow an attacker to determine the presence of an individual in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Motivated by these concerns, an early line of work from the statistics community focused on addressing these issues [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#VS09">VS09</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#USF13">USF13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#YFSU14">YFSU14</a>].</p>
<p>More recently, work on private hypothesis testing can be divided roughly into two lines. The first focuses on the minimax sample complexity, in a line initiated by Cai, Daskalakis, and Kamath [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CDK17">CDK17</a>], who give an algorithm for privately testing goodness-of-fit (more precisely, a statistician might refer to this problem as one-sample testing of multinomial data). A number of subsequent works have essentially settled the complexity of this problem [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ASZ18">ASZ18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ADR18">ADR18</a>], giving tight upper and lower bounds. Other papers in this line study related problems, including the two-sample version of the problem, independence testing, and goodness-of-fit testing for multivariate product distributions [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ASZ18">ASZ18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ADR18">ADR18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#ADKR19">ADKR19</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMUZ19">CKMUZ19</a>]. A related paper studies the minimax sample complexity of property <em>estimation</em>, rather than testing of discrete distributions, including support size and entropy [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#AKSZ18">AKSZ18</a>]. Other recent works in this vein focus on testing of simple hypotheses [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMTZ18">CKMTZ18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMSU19">CKMSU19</a>]. In particular [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMSU19">CKMSU19</a>] proves an analogue of the Neyman-Pearson Lemma for differentially private testing of simple hypotheses. A paper of Awan and Slavkovic [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#AS18">AS18</a>] gives a universally optimal test when the domain size is two, however Brenner and Nissim [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BN14">BN14</a>] shows that such universally optimal tests cannot exist when the domain has more than two elements. A related problem in this space is private change-point detection [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMTZ18">CKMTZ18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKMSU19">CKMSU19</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKLZ19">CKLZ19</a>] — in this setting, we are given a time series of datapoints which are sampled from a distribution, which at some point, changes to a different distribution. The goal is to (privately) determine when this point occurs.</p>
<p>Complementary to minimax hypothesis testing, a line of work [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#WLK15">WLK15</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#GLRV16">GLRV16</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KR17">KR17</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KSF17">KSF17</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CBRG18">CBRG18</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SGGRGB19">SGGRGB19</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CKSBG19">CKSBG19</a>] designs differentially private versions of popular test statistics for testing goodness-of-fit, closeness, and independence, as well as private ANOVA, focusing on the performance at small sample sizes. Work by Wang et al. [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#WKLK18">WKLK18</a>] focuses on generating statistical approximating distributions for differentially private statistics, which they apply to hypothesis testing problems.</p>
<p><b> 2.3. Differential Privacy on Graphs </b></p>
<p>There is a significant amount of work on differentially private analysis of graphs. We remark that these algorithms can satisfy either edge or node differential privacy. The former (easier) guarantee defines a neighboring graph to be one obtained by adding or removing a single edge, while in the latter (harder) setting, a neighboring graph is one that can be obtained by modifying the set of edges connected to a single node. The main challenge in this area is that most graph statistics can have high sensitivity in the worst-case.</p>
<p>The initial works in this area focused on the empirical setting, and goals range from counting subgraphs [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KRSY11">KRSY11</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BBDS13">BBDS13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KNRS13">KNRS13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CZ13">CZ13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#RS16">RS16</a>] to outputting a privatized graph which approximates the original [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#GRU12">GRU12</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BBDS12">BBDS12</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#Upa13">Upa13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#AU19">AU19</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#EKKL20">EKKL20</a>]. In contrast to the setting discussed in most of this series, it seems that there are larger qualitative differences between the study of empirical and population statistics due to the fact that many graph statistics have high worst-case sensitivity, but may have smaller sensitivity on typical graphs from many natural models.</p>
<p>In the population statistics setting, recent work has focused on parameter estimation of the underlying random graph model. So far this work has given estimators for the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\beta}" class="latex" title="{\beta}" />-model [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KS16">KS16</a>] and graphons [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BCS15">BCS15</a>,<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BCSZ18">BCSZ18</a>]. Graphons are a generalization of the stochastic block model, which is, in turn, a generalization of the Erdös-Rényi model. Interestingly, the methods of Lipschitz-extensions introduced in the empirical setting by [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BBDS13">BBDS13</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KNRS13">KNRS13</a>] are the main tool used in the statistical setting as well. While the first works on private graphon estimation were not computationally efficient, a recent focus has been on obviating these issues for certain important cases, such as the Erdös-Rényi setting [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU19">SU19</a>].</p>

<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Scott’s foreword:</span></strong> Today I’m honored to host another guest post by friend-of-the-blog Steve Ebin, who not only published a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4675">beautiful essay</a> here a month ago (the one that I titled “First it came from Wuhan”), but also posted an extremely informative <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4695#comment-1834991">timeline</a> of what he understood when about the severity of the covid crisis, from early January until March 31st.  By the latter date, Steve had quit his job, having made a hefty sum shorting airline stocks, and was devoting his full time to a new nonprofit to manufacture low-cost ventilators, called AirToAll.  A couple weeks ago, Steve was kind enough to include me in one of AirToAll’s regular Zoom meetings; I learned more about pistons than I had in my entire previous life (admittedly, still not much).  Which brings me to what Steve wants to talk about today: what he and others are doing and how <em>you</em> can help.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Without further ado, Steve’s guest post:</span></strong></p>



<p>In my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4675">last essay</a> on Coronavirus, I argued that Coronavirus will radically change society.  In this blog post, I’d like to propose a structure for how we can organize to fight the virus.  I will also make a call to action for readers of this blog to help a non-profit I co-founded, <a href="http://airtoall.org">AirToAll</a>, build safe, low-cost ventilators and other medical devices and distribute them across the world at scale.</p>



<p>There are four ways we can help fight coronavirus:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Reduce exposure to the virus. </strong>Examples: learn where the virus is through better testing; attempt to be where the virus isn’t through social distancing, quarantining, and other means.</li><li><strong>Reduce the chance of exposure leading to infection.</strong> Examples: Wash your hands; avoid touching your face; wear personal protective equipment.</li><li><strong>Reduce the chance of infection leading to serious illness. </strong>Examples: improve your aerobic and pulmonary health; make it more difficult for coronavirus’s spike protein to bind to ACE-2 receptors; scale antibody therapies; consume adequate vitamin D; get more sleep; develop a vaccine.</li><li><strong>Reduce the chance of serious illness leading to death. </strong>Examples: ramp up the production and distribution of certain drugs; develop better drugs; build more ventilators; help healthcare workers.</li></ol>



<p>Obviously, not every example I listed is practical, advisable, or will work, and some options, like producing a vaccine, may be better solutions than others. But we must pursue all approaches.</p>



<p>I’ve been devoting my own time to pursuing the fourth approach, reducing the chance that the illness will lead to death.  Specifically, along with Neil Thanedar, I co-founded AirToAll, a nonprofit that helps bring low-cost, reliable, and clinically tested ventilators to market.  I know lots of groups are working on this problem, so I thought I’d talk about it briefly.</p>



<p>First, like many groups, we’re designing our own ventilators.  Although designing ventilators and bringing them to market at scale poses unique challenges, particularly in an environment where supply chains are strained, this is <em>much </em>easier than it must have been to build iron lungs in the early part of the 20th century, when Zoom conferencing wasn’t yet invented.  When it comes to the ventilators we’re producing, we’re focused on safety and clinical validation rather than speed to market.  We are not the farthest along here, but we’ve made good progress.</p>



<p>Second, our nonprofit is helping other groups produce safe and reliable ventilators by doing direct consultations with them and also by producing <a href="https://591654b2-a393-4da6-9d87-f168fb514898.filesusr.com/ugd/9fa1d3_9f8fa025b877468e91b8ba575c054815.pdf">whitepapers</a> to help them think through the issues at hand (h/t to Harvey Hawes, Abdullah Saleh, and our friends at <a href="https://icchange.ca/">ICChange</a>).</p>



<p>Third, we’re working to increase the manufacturing capacity for currently approved ventilators.</p>



<p>The current shortage of ventilators is a symptom of a greater underlying problem: namely, the world is not good at recognizing healthcare crises early and responding to them quickly.  While our nonprofit helps bring more ventilators to market, we are also trying to solve this greater underlying problem.  I look at our work in ventilator-land as a first step towards our ultimate goal of making medical devices cheaper and more available through an open-source nonprofit model.</p>



<p>I am writing this post as a call to action to you, dear <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> reader, to get involved.</p>



<p>You don’t have to be an engineer, pulmonologist, virologist, or epidemiologist to help us, although those skillsets are of course helpful and if you are we’d love to have you.  If you have experience in data science and modeling, supply chain and manufacturing, public health, finance, operations, community management, or anything else a rapidly scaling organization needs, you can help us too. </p>



<p>We are a group of 700+ volunteers and growing rapidly.  If you’d like to help, we’d love to have you.  If you might be interested in volunteering, click <a href="https://airtoall.org/community/">here</a>.  Donors click <a href="https://airtoall.org/donate/">here</a>.  Everyone else, please email me at <a href="mailto:steven@airtoall.org">steven@airtoall.org</a> and include a clear subject line so I can direct you to the right person.</p></div>
