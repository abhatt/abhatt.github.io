<div class="content">
Multipoint evaluation is the computational task of evaluating a polynomial given as a list of coefficients at a given set of inputs. Besides being a natural and fundamental question in computer algebra on its own, fast algorithms for this problem is also closely related to fast algorithms for other natural algebraic questions like polynomial factorization and modular composition. And while \emph{nearly linear time} algorithms have been known for the univariate instance of multipoint evaluation  for close to five decades due to a work of Borodin and Moenck \cite{BM74}, fast algorithms for the multivariate version have been much harder to come by. In a significant improvement to the state of art for this problem, Umans \cite{Umans08} and Kedlaya \&amp; Umans \cite{Kedlaya11} gave nearly linear time algorithms for this problem over field of small characteristic and over all finite fields respectively, provided that the number of variables $n$ is at most $d^{o(1)}$ where the degree of the input polynomial in every variable is less than $d$. They also stated the question of designing fast algorithms for the large variable case (i.e. $n \notin d^{o(1)}$) as an open problem. 

In this work, we show that there is a deterministic algorithm for multivariate multipoint evaluation over a field $\F_{q}$ of characteristic $p$ which evaluates an $n$-variate polynomial of degree less than $d$ in each variable on $N$ inputs in time $$\left((N + d^n)^{1 + o(1)}\poly(\log q, d, p, n)\right) \, ,$$ provided that $p$ is at most $d^{o(1)}$, and $q$ is at most $(\exp(\exp(\exp(\cdots (\exp(d)))))$, where the height of this tower of exponentials is fixed. When the number of variables is large (e.g. $n \notin d^{o(1)}$), this is the first {nearly linear} time algorithm for this problem over any (large enough) field.

Our algorithm is based on elementary algebraic ideas and this algebraic structure naturally leads to the following two independently interesting applications.

\begin{itemize}
\item We  show that there is an \emph{algebraic} data structure for univariate polynomial evaluation with nearly linear space complexity and sublinear time complexity over finite fields of small characteristic and quasipolynomially bounded size. This  provides a counterexample to a conjecture of Milterson \cite{M95} who conjectured that over small finite fields, any algebraic data structure for polynomial evaluation using  polynomial space must have linear query complexity. 

 \item We also show that over finite fields of small characteristic and quasipolynomially bounded size,  Vandermonde matrices are not rigid enough to  yield size-depth tradeoffs for linear circuits via the current quantitative bounds in Valiant's program \cite{Valiant1977}. More precisely, for every fixed prime $p$, we show that for every constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$, and large enough $n$, the rank of any $n \times n$ Vandermonde matrix $V$ over the field $\F_{p^a}$ can be reduced to $
   \left(n/\exp(\Omega(\poly(\epsilon)\sqrt{\log n}))\right) $ by changing at most $n^{\Theta(\epsilon)}$ entries in every row of $V$, provided $a \leq \poly(\log n)$. Prior to this work, similar upper bounds on rigidity were known only for special Vandermonde matrices. For instance, the Discrete Fourier Transform matrices and Vandermonde matrices with generators in a geometric progression \cite{DL20}.

<div class="content">
<p>Back in March of 2019 <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/03/scooped.html">I wrote</a></p><blockquote><p>I was also going to post about Yann LeCun's Facebook rant about stodgy CS departments but then Yann goes ahead and wins a Turing award with Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio for their work on machine learning. I knew Yann from when we worked together at NEC Research in the early 2000's and let's just congratulate him and the others and let them bask in glory for truly transforming how we think of computing today. I'll get back to his post soon enough.</p></blockquote><p>So not that soon. Yann's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10152719972317143&amp;id=722677142">post</a> was from 2015 where he went after "stodgy" CS departments naming Yale, Harvard, Princeton and Chicago.</p><blockquote><p>CS is a quickly evolving field.  Because of excess conservatism, these departments have repeatedly missed important trends in CS and related field, such as Data Science. They seem to view CS as meaning strictly theory, crypto, systems and programming  languages, what some have called "core CS", paying lip service to graphics, vision, machine learning, AI, HCI, robotics, etc. But these areas are the ones that have been expanding the fastest in the last decades, particularly machine learning and computer vision in the last decade....It is quite common, and somewhat natural, that newer areas (eg ML) be looked down upon by members of older, more established areas (eg Theory and Systems). After all, scientists are professional skeptics. But in a fast evolving disciplines like CS and now Data Science, an excessive aversion to risk and change is a recipe for failure.</p></blockquote><p>We've seen some changes since. Yale's Statistics Department is now <a href="https://statistics.yale.edu/">Statistics and Data Science</a>. The University of Chicago has a new Data Science <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/new-college-data-science-major-foundations-insight-impact">undergrad major</a> and <a href="https://cdac.uchicago.edu/insights/introducing-the-uchicago-data-science-institute/">institute</a>.</p><p>I wonder if that's the future. CS doesn't really change that much, at least not quickly. Data science, and perhaps cybersecurity, evolve as separate fields which only have limited intersection with traditional CS. The CS degree itself just focuses on those interested in how the machines work and the theory behind them. We're busy trying to figure this out at Illinois Tech as are most other schools. And what about augmented/virtual reality and the metaverse, quantum computing, fintech, social networks, human and social factors and so on? How do you choose which bets to make? </p><p>Most of all, universities, traditionally slowly moving machines, need to far more agile even in fields outside computing since the digital transformation is affecting everything. How do you plan degrees when the computing landscape when students graduate is different from when they start? </p></div>

approaches consist in scanning all quadruples of the graph or using fast matrix

this paper, we propose and evaluate an approach that uses a hierarchy of
distance-k dominating sets to reduce the search space. This technique, compared
to the previous best practical algorithms, enables us to compute the
hyperbolicity of graphs with unprecedented size (up to a million nodes) and
speeds up the computation of previously attainable graphs by up to 3 orders of

23.

(5G), the diverse forms of collaboration and extensive data in academic social
networks constructed by 5G papers make the management and analysis of academic
social networks increasingly challenging. Despite the particular success
achieved by representation learning in analyzing academic and social networks,
most present presentation learning models focus on maintaining the first-order
and second-order similarity of nodes. They rarely possess similar structural
characteristics of spatial independence in the network. This paper proposes a
Low-order Network representation Learning Model (LNLM) based on Non-negative
Matrix Factorization (NMF) to solve these problems. The model uses the random
walk method to extract low-order features of nodes and map multiple components
to a low-dimensional space, effectively maintaining the internal correlation
between members. This paper verifies the performance of this model, conducts
comparative experiments on four test datasets and four real network datasets
through downstream tasks such as multi-label classification, clustering, and
link prediction. Comparing eight mainstream network representation learning
models shows that the proposed model can significantly improve the detection
efficiency and learning methods and effectively extract local and low-order
features of the network.

problems, closely related to central problems in complexity theory, that can be
formulated in terms of the asymptotic growth of the size of the maximum
independent sets in powers of a fixed small (directed or undirected)
hypergraph, also called the Shannon capacity. An important instance of this is
the corner problem studied in the context of multiparty communication
complexity in the Number On the Forehead (NOF) model. Versions of this problem
and the NOF connection have seen much interest (and progress) in recent works
of Linial, Pitassi and Shraibman (ITCS 2019) and Linial and Shraibman (CCC
2021).
</p>
<p>We introduce and study a general algebraic method for lower bounding the
Shannon capacity of directed hypergraphs via combinatorial degenerations, a
combinatorial kind of "approximation" of subgraphs that originates from the
study of matrix multiplication in algebraic complexity theory (and which play
an important role there) but which we use in a novel way.
</p>
<p>Using the combinatorial degeneration method, we make progress on the corner
problem by explicitly constructing a corner-free subset in $F_2^n \times F_2^n$
of size $\Omega(3.39^n/poly(n))$, which improves the previous lower bound
$\Omega(2.82^n)$ of Linial, Pitassi and Shraibman (ITCS 2019) and which gets us
closer to the best upper bound $4^{n - o(n)}$. Our new construction of
corner-free sets implies an improved NOF protocol for the Eval problem. In the
Eval problem over a group $G$, three players need to determine whether their
inputs $x_1, x_2, x_3 \in G$ sum to zero. We find that the NOF communication
complexity of the Eval problem over $F_2^n$ is at most $0.24n + O(\log n)$,
which improves the previous upper bound $0.5n + O(\log n)$.

$\ell$ in the arrangement $\mathcal{A}(L)$ of $L$ is the set of faces of
$\mathcal{A}(L)$ whose closure intersects $\ell$. It is known that the
combinatorial size of $Z(\ell)$ is $O(n)$. Given $L$ and $\ell$, computing
$Z(\ell)$ is a fundamental problem. Linear-time algorithms exist for computing
$Z(\ell)$ if $\mathcal{A}(L)$ has already been built, but building
$\mathcal{A}(L)$ takes $O(n^2)$ time. On the other hand, $O(n\log n)$-time
algorithms are also known for computing $Z(\ell)$ without relying on
$\mathcal{A}(L)$, but these algorithms are relatively complicated. In this
paper, we present a simple algorithm that can compute $Z(\ell)$ in $O(n\log n)$

$\ell$ and the lines of $L$ is known, the algorithm runs in $O(n)$ time. A big
advantage of our algorithm, which mainly involves a Graham's scan style
procedure, is its simplicity.

We are given
capacitated nodes and an online sequence of jobs, each with a release time and
a demand to be routed between two nodes. A schedule specifies which jobs are
routed in each step, guaranteeing that the total demand on a node in any step
is at most its capacity. A key metric in this scenario is response time: the
time between a job's release and its completion. Prior work shows no
un-augmented algorithm is competitive for average response time, and that a
constant factor competitive ratio is achievable with augmentation exceeding 2
(Dinitz-Moseley Infocom 2020). For maximum response time, the best known result
is a 2-competitive algorithm with a augmentation 4 (Jahanjou et al SPAA 2020).
We improve these bounds under various response time objectives. We show that,
without resource augmentation, the best competitive ratio for maximum response
time is $\Omega(n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes. Our Proportional
Allocation algorithm uses $(1+\varepsilon)$ resource augmentation to achieve a
$(1/\varepsilon)$-competitive ratio in the setting with general demands and
capacities, and splittable jobs. Our Batch Decomposition algorithm is
$2$-competitive (resp., optimal) for maximum response time using resource
augmentation 2 (resp., 4) in the setting with unit demands and capacities, and
unsplittable jobs. We also derive bounds for the simultaneous approximation of
average and maximum response time metrics.

(unsplittable) Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) in general metrics.
In CVRP, introduced by Dantzig and Ramser (1959), we are given a set of points
(clients) $V$ together with a depot $r$ in a metric space, with each $v\in V$
having a demand $d_v&gt;0$, and a vehicle of bounded capacity $Q$. The goal is to
find a minimum cost collection of tours for the vehicle, each starting and
ending at the depot, such that each client is visited at least once and the
total demands of the clients in each tour is at most $Q$. In the unsplittable
variant we study, the demand of a node must be served entirely by one tour. We
present two approximation algorithms for unsplittable CVRP: a combinatorial
$(\alpha+1.75)$-approximation, where $\alpha$ is the approximation factor for
the Traveling Salesman Problem, and an approximation algorithm based on LP
rounding with approximation guarantee $\alpha+\ln(2) + \delta \approx 3.194 +
\delta$ in $n^{O(1/\delta)}$ time. Both approximations can further be improved
by a small amount when combined with recent work by Blauth, Traub, and Vygen
(2021), who obtained an $(\alpha + 2\cdot (1 -\epsilon))$-approximation for
unsplittable CVRP for some constant $\epsilon$ depending on $\alpha$ ($\epsilon
&gt; 1/3000$ for $\alpha = 1.5$).

efficient probabilistic tests of membership. Tensor codes provide a simple
family of combinatorial constructions of locally testable codes that generalize
the family of Reed-Muller codes. The natural test for tensor codes, the
axis-parallel line vs. point test, plays an essential role in constructions of
probabilistically checkable proofs.

<p>We analyze the axis-parallel line vs. point test as a two-prover game and
show that the test is sound against quantum provers sharing entanglement. Our
result implies the quantum-soundness of the low individual degree test, which
is an essential component of the MIP* = RE theorem. Our proof also generalizes
to the infinite-dimensional commuting-operator model of quantum provers.

problem of Set Cover within a factor of ln(n), and it was recently proven that
this approximation ratio is optimal unless P = NP. This optimality result is
the product of many advances in characterizations of NP, in terms of
interactive proof systems and probabilistically checkable proofs (PCP), and
improvements to the analyses thereof. However, as a result, it is difficult to
extract the development of Set Cover approximation bounds from the greater
scope of proof system analysis. This paper attempts to present a chronological
progression of results on lower-bounding the approximation ratio of Set Cover.
We analyze a series of proofs of progressively better bounds and unify the
results under similar terminologies and frameworks to provide an accurate
comparison of proof techniques and their results. We also treat many
preliminary results as black-boxes to better focus our analysis on the core
reductions to Set Cover instances. The result is alternative versions of
several hardness proofs, beginning with initial inapproximability results and
culminating in a version of the proof that ln(n) is a tight lower bound.

<p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/l/Lin:Tianyi.html">Tianyi Lin</a>, Michael. I. Jordan <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.08093">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>We propose and analyze a new dynamical system with \textit{a closed-loop
control law} in a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, aiming to shed light on the
acceleration phenomenon for \textit{monotone inclusion} problems, which unifies
a broad class of optimization, saddle point and variational inequality (VI)
problems under a single framework. Given an operator $A: \mathcal{H}
\rightrightarrows \mathcal{H}$ that is maximal monotone, we study a closed-loop
control system that is governed by the operator $I - (I + \lambda(t)A)^{-1}$
where $\lambda(\cdot)$ is tuned by the resolution of the algebraic equation
$\lambda(t)\|(I + \lambda(t)A)^{-1}x(t) - x(t)\|^{p-1} = \theta$ for some
$\theta \in (0, 1)$. Our first contribution is to prove the existence and
uniqueness of a global solution via the Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem. We present a
Lyapunov function that allows for establishing the weak convergence of
trajectories and strong convergence results under additional conditions. We
establish a global ergodic rate of $O(t^{-(p+1)/2})$ in terms of a gap function
and a global pointwise rate of $O(t^{-p/2})$ in terms of a residue function.
Local linear convergence is established in terms of a distance function under
an error bound condition. Further, we provide an algorithmic framework based on
implicit discretization of our system in a Euclidean setting, generalizing the
large-step HPE framework of~\citet{Monteiro-2012-Iteration}. While the
discrete-time analysis is a simplification and generalization of the previous
analysis for bounded domain, it is motivated by the aforementioned
continuous-time analysis, illustrating the fundamental role that the
closed-loop control plays in acceleration in monotone inclusion. A highlight of
our analysis is set of new results concerning $p$-th order tensor algorithms
for monotone inclusion problems, which complement the recent analysis for
saddle point and VI problems.

adversarially chosen queries arrive and must be assigned a label online. Unlike
traditional bounds which seek to minimize the misclassification rate, we
minimize the total distance from each query to the region corresponding to its
correct label. When the true labels are determined via a nearest neighbor
partition -- i.e. the label of a point is given by which of $k$ centers it is
closest to in Euclidean distance -- we show that one can achieve a loss that is
independent of the total number of queries. We complement this result by
showing that learning general convex sets requires an almost linear loss per
query. Our results build off of regret guarantees for the geometric problem of
contextual search. In addition, we develop a novel reduction technique from
multiclass classification to binary classification which may be of independent
interest.

Euler calculus. Lebesgue integration gives access to well-studied kernels and
to regularity results, while Euler calculus conveys topological information and
allows for compatibility with operations on constructible functions. We conduct
a systematic study of such transforms and introduce two new ones: the
Euler-Fourier and Euler-Laplace transforms. We show that the first has a left
inverse and that the second provides a satisfactory generalization of Govc and
Hepworth's persistent magnitude to constructible sheaves, in particular to
multi-parameter persistent modules. Finally, we prove index-theoretic formulae
expressing a wide class of hybrid transforms as generalized Euler integral
transforms. This yields expectation formulae for transforms of constructible
functions associated to (sub)level-sets persistence of random Gaussian
filtrations.

<p><strong>About IBM’s new <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/127-qubit-quantum-processor-eagle">127-qubit superconducting chip</a>:</strong> As I <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2297583-ibm-creates-largest-ever-superconducting-quantum-computer/">told <em>New Scientist</em></a>, I look forward to seeing the actual details!  As far as I could see, the marketing materials that IBM released yesterday take a lot of words to say absolutely nothing about what, to experts, is the single most important piece of information: namely, <em>what are the gate fidelities?</em>  How deep of a quantum circuit can they apply?  How have they benchmarked the chip?  Right now, all I have to go on is a <a href="https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/services?services=systems&amp;order=qubits%20DESC&amp;view=table&amp;system=ibm_washington">stats page</a> for the new chip, <s>which reports its average CNOT error as 0.9388—in other words, close to 1, or terrible! (But see also a <a href="https://twitter.com/decodoku/status/1460622008916627456?s=21">tweet by James Wootton</a>, which explains that such numbers are often highly misleading when a new chip is first rolled out.)  Does anyone here have more information?</s>  <strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (11/17):</span></strong> As of this morning, the average CNOT error has been updated to 2%.  Thanks to multiple commenters for letting me know!</p>



<p><strong>About the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14502">new simulation</a> of Google’s 53-qubit Sycamore chip in 5 minutes on a Sunway supercomputer (see also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01066">here</a>):</strong> This is an exciting step forward on the classical validation of quantum supremacy experiments, and—ironically, what currently amounts to almost the same thing—on the classical <em>spoofing</em> of those experiments.  Congratulations to the team in China that achieved this!  But there are two crucial things to understand.  First, “5 minutes” refers to the time needed to calculate a <em>single</em> amplitude (or perhaps, several correlated amplitudes) using tensor network contraction.  It doesn’t refer to the time needed to generate millions of <em>independent</em> noisy samples, which is what Google’s Sycamore chip does in 3 minutes.  For the latter task, more like a week still seems to be needed on the supercomputer.  (I’m grateful to Chu Guo, a coauthor of the new work who spoke in UT Austin’s weekly quantum Zoom meeting, for clarifying this point.)  Second, the Sunway supercomputer has parallel processing power equivalent to approximately ten million of your laptop.  Thus, even if we agreed that Google no longer had quantum supremacy as measured by time, it would still have quantum supremacy as measured by carbon footprint!  (And this despite the fact that the quantum computer itself requires a noisy, closet-sized dilution fridge.)  Even so, for me the new work underscores the point that quantum supremacy is not yet a done deal.  Over the next few years, I hope that Google and USTC, as well as any new entrants to this race (IBM? IonQ? Harvard? Rigetti?), will push forward with more qubits and, even more importantly, better gate fidelities leading to higher Linear Cross-Entropy scores.  Meanwhile, we theorists should try to do our part by inventing new and better protocols with which to demonstrate near-term quantum supremacy—<em>especially</em> protocols for which the classical verification is easier.</p>



<p><strong>About the new anti-woke <a href="https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/we-cant-wait-for-universities-to">University of Austin</a> (UATX):</strong> In general, I’m extremely happy for people to experiment with new and different institutions, and of course I’m happy for more intellectual activity in my adopted city of Austin.  And, as <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers will know, I’m probably more sympathetic than most to the reality of the problem that UATX is trying to solve—living, as we do, in an era when one academic after another has been cancelled for ideas that a mere decade ago would’ve been considered unexceptional, moderate, center-left.  Having said all that, I wish I could feel more optimistic about UATX’s prospects.  I found its <a href="https://www.uaustin.org/">website</a> heavy on free-speech rhetoric but frustratingly light on what the new university is actually going to <em>do</em>: what courses it will offer, who will teach them, where the campus will be, etc. etc.  Arguably this is all excusable for a university still in ramp-up mode, but had I been in their shoes, I might have held off on the public launch until I had at least some sample content to offer.  Certainly, the fact that Steven Pinker has <a href="https://www.uaustin.org/news/uatx-statement-about-robert-zimmer-and-steven-pinker">quit UATX’s advisory board</a> is a discouraging sign.  If UATX asks me to get involved—to lecture there, to give them advice about their CS program, etc.—I’ll consider it as I would any other request.  So far, though, they haven’t.</p>



<p><strong>About the Association for Mathematical Research:</strong> Last month, some colleagues invited me to join a brand-new society called the <a href="https://amathr.org/">Association for Mathematical Research</a>.  Many of the other founders (Joel Hass, Abigail Thompson, Colin Adams, Richard Borcherds, Jeff Cheeger, Pavel Etingof, Tom Hales, Jeff Lagarias, Mark Lackenby, Cliff Taubes, …) were brilliant mathematicians who I admired, they seemed like they could use a bit of theoretical computer science representation, there was no time commitment, maybe they’d eventually do something good, so I figured why not?  Alas, to say that AMR has proved unpopular on Twitter would be an understatement: it’s received the same contemptuous reception that UATX has.  The argument seems to be: starting a new mathematical society, even an avowedly diverse and apolitical one, is really just an implicit claim that the existing societies, like the <a href="https://www.maa.org/">Mathematical Association of America (MAA)</a>  and the <a href="https://www.ams.org/home/page">American Mathematical Society (AMS)</a>, have been co-opted by woke true-believers.  But that’s paranoid and insane!  I mean, it’s not as if an <a href="https://blogs.ams.org/inclusionexclusion/">AMS blog</a> has called for the <a href="https://blogs.ams.org/inclusionexclusion/2017/05/11/get-out-the-way/#more-772">mass resignation</a> of white male mathematicians to make room for the marginalized, or the boycott of Israeli universities, or the abolition of the criminal justice system <font size="-3"><em>(what to do about Kyle Rittenhouse though?)</em></font>.  Still, even though claims of that sort of co-option are obviously far-out, rabid fantasies, yeah, I did decide to give a new organization the benefit of the doubt.  AMR might well fail or languish in obscurity, just like UATX might.  On the other hand, the barriers to making a positive difference for the intellectual world, the world I love, the world under constant threat from the self-certain ideologues of every side, do strike me as orders of magnitude smaller for a new professional society than they do for a new university.</p></div>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Classic models of communication in economics typically assume agents can communicate any message.  However, many important communications, such as those in newspapers or politicians’ speeches, use data to convey information.  In this talk, we explore how the reliance on data impacts communication.  In our model, there are two Bayesian agents (a sender and a receiver) who wish to communicate. The receiver must take an action whose payoff depends on their personal preferences and an unknown state of the world. The sender has access to a collection of data points correlated with the state of the world and can send exactly one of these to the receiver in order to influence her choice of action. Importantly, the sender’s personal preferences may differ from the receiver’s, which affects the sender’s strategic choice of what to send. We show that in a Nash equilibrium even a small difference in preferences can lead to a significant bias in the communicated datum. This can significantly reduce informativeness of the communication, leading to substantial utility loss for both sides. One implication is informational homophily: a receiver can rationally prefer to obtain data from a poorly-informed sender with aligned preferences, rather than a knowledgeable expert whose preferences may differ from her own.  </p>

A PAC learning model involves two worst-case requirements: a learner must learn all functions in a class on all example distributions. However, basing the hardness of learning on NP-hardness has remained a key challenge for decades. In fact, recent progress in computational complexity suggests the possibility that a weaker assumption might be sufficient for worst-case learning than the feasibility of worst-case algorithms for NP problems.

In this study, we investigate whether these worst-case requirements for learning are satisfied on the basis of only average-case assumptions in order to understand the nature of learning. First, we construct a strong worst-case learner based on the assumption that DistNP $\subseteq$ AvgP, i.e., in Heuristica. Our learner agnostically learns all polynomial-size circuits on all unknown P/poly-samplable distributions in polynomial time, where the complexity of learning depends on the complexity of sampling examples. Second, we study the limitation of relativizing constructions of learners based on average-case heuristic algorithms. Specifically, we construct a powerful oracle such that DistPH $\subseteq$ AvgP, i.e., every problem in PH is easy on average, whereas UP $\cap$ coUP and PAC learning on almost-uniform distributions are hard even for $2^{n/\omega(\log n)}$-time algorithms in the relativized world, which improves the oracle separation presented by Impagliazzo (CCC 2011). The core concept of our improvements is the consideration of a switching lemma on a large alphabet, which may be of independent interest. The lower bound on the time complexity is nearly optimal because Hirahara (STOC 2021) showed that DistPH $\subseteq$ AvgP implies that PH can be solved in time $2^{O(n / \log n)}$ under any relativized world.</div>

Let $\Pi$ be a protocol over the $n$-party broadcast channel, where in each round, a pre-specified party broadcasts a symbol to all other parties. We wish to design a scheme that takes such a protocol $\Pi$ as input and outputs a noise resilient protocol $\Pi'$ that simulates $\Pi$ over the noisy broadcast channel, where each received symbol is flipped with a fixed constant probability, independently. What is the minimum overhead in the number of rounds that is incurred by any such simulation scheme?

A classical result by Gallager from the 80's shows that non-interactive $T$-round protocols, where the bit communicated in every round is independent of the communication history, can be converted to noise resilient ones with only an $\mathcal{O}(\log \log T)$ multiplicative overhead in the number of rounds. Can the same be proved for any protocol? Or, are there protocols whose simulation requires an $\Omega(\log T)$ overhead (which always suffices)? 

We answer both the above questions in the negative: We give a simulation scheme with an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log T})$ overhead for every protocol and channel alphabet. We also prove an (almost) matching lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{\log T})$ on the overhead required to simulate the pointer chasing protocol with $T=n$ and polynomial alphabet.</div>

<div class="content">
For a complexity class $C$ and language $L$, a constructive separation of $L \notin C$ gives an efficient algorithm (also called a refuter) to find counterexamples (bad inputs) for every $C$-algorithm attempting to decide $L$. We study the questions: Which lower bounds can be made constructive? What are the consequences of constructive separations? We build a case that  ``constructiveness'' serves as a dividing line between many weak lower bounds we know how to prove, and strong lower bounds against $P$, $ZPP$, and $BPP$. Put another way, constructiveness is the opposite of a complexity barrier: it is a property we want lower bounds to have. Our results fall into three broad categories.
		
1. For many separations, making them constructive would imply breakthrough lower bounds. Our first set of results shows that, for many well-known lower bounds against streaming algorithms, one-tape Turing machines, and query complexity, as well as lower bounds for the Minimum Circuit Size Problem, making these lower bounds constructive would imply breakthrough separations ranging from $EXP \neq BPP$ to even $P \neq NP$. 

2. Most conjectured uniform separations can be made constructive. Our second set of results shows that for most major open problems in lower bounds against $P$, $ZPP$, and $BPP$, including $P \neq NP$, $P \neq PSPACE$, $P \neq PP$, $ZPP \neq EXP$, and $BPP \neq NEXP$, any proof of the separation would further imply a constructive separation. Our results generalize earlier results for $P \neq NP$ [Gutfreund, Shaltiel, and Ta-Shma, CCC 2005] and $BPP \neq NEXP$ [Dolev, Fandina and Gutfreund, CIAC 2013]. Thus any proof of these strong lower bounds must also yield a constructive version, compared to many weak lower bounds we currently know.
		
3. Some separations cannot be made constructive. Our third set of results shows that certain complexity separations cannot be made constructive. We observe that for all super-polynomially growing functions $t$, there are no constructive separations for detecting high $t$-time Kolmogorov complexity (a task which is known to be not in $P$) from any complexity class, unconditionally. We also show that under plausible conjectures, there are languages in $NP - P$ for which there are no constructive separations from any complexity class.</div>

<div class="content">
<p> I posted on <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/07/when-did-math-get-so-hard.html">When did Math get so hard?</a> a commenter pointed out that one can also ask </p><p><br /></p><p><i>When did Computer Science Theory Get so Hard?</i></p><p>For the Math-question I could only speculate. For CS- I WAS THERE! When I was in Grad School one could learn all of Complexity theory in a year-long course (a hard one, but still!). The main tools were logic and combinatorics. No Fourier Transforms over finite fields. I am NOT going to say</p><p><i>Those were the good old days.</i></p><p>I will say that it was easier to make a contribution without knowing much. Oddly enough, it is MORE common for ugrads and grad students to publish NOW then it was THEN, so that may be a pair of ducks.</p><p><b>Random Thoughts on This Question</b></p><p>1) The Graph Minor Theorem was when P lost its innocence. Before the GMT most (though not all)  problems in P had easy-to-understand  algorithms using algorithmic paradigms (e.g., Dynamic  Programming) and maybe some combinatorics. Computational Number Theory used.... Number Theory (duh), but I don't think it was hard number theory. One exception was Miller's Primality test which needed to assume the Extended Riemann Hypothesis- but you didn't have to understand ERH to use it. </p><p>1.5) GMT again. This did not only give hard-deep-math algorithms to get problems in P. It  also pointed to  how hard proving P NE NP would be--- to rule out something like a GMT-type result to get SAT in P seems rather hard. </p><p>2) Oracle Constructions were fairly easy diagonalizations. It was bummed out that I never had to use an infinite injury priority argument. That is, I knew some complicated recursion theory, but it was never used. </p><p>2.5) Oracles again. Dana Angluin had a paper which used some complicated combinatorics to construct an oracle, see <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304397580900274?via%3Dihub">here</a>. Later Andy Yao showed that there is an oracle A such that  PH^A NE  PSPACE^A. You might know that result better as</p><p><i>Constant depth circuits for parity must have exponential size. </i></p><p>I think we now care about circuits more than oracles, see my post <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2015/04/the-new-oracle-result-new-circuit.html">here</a> about that issue. Anyway, oracle results since then have used hard combinatorial and other math arguments. </p><p>3) The PCP result was a leap forward for difficulty. I don't know which paper to pick as THE Leap since there were several. And papers after that were also rather difficult.  </p><p>4) I had a blog post <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/04/do-any-np-reductions-use-deep.html#comment-form">here</a> where I asked if REDUCTIONS ever use hard math. Some of the comments are relevant here:</p><p>Stella Biderman: The deepest part of the original PCP theorem is the invention of the VC paradigm in the 1990's.</p><p>Eldar: Fourier Theory was introduced to CS with Hastad's Optimal Approximation results. Today it might not be considered deep, but I recall when it was.</p><p>Also there are Algebraic Geometry codes which use downright arcane mathematics...</p><p>Hermann Gruber refers to Comp Topology and Comp Geometry and points to the result that 3-manifold knot genus is NP-complete, see <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/509907.510016">here</a>.</p><p>Anonymous (they leave many comments) points to the deep math reductions in arithmetic versions of P/NP classes, and Mulmuley's work (Geometric Complexity Theory).</p><p>Timothy Chow points out that `deep' could mean several things and points to a math overflow post on the issue of depth, <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/139607/what-are-some-deep-theorems-and-why-are-they-considered-deep">here</a>.</p><p>Marzio De Biasi points out that even back in 1978 there was a poly reduction that required a good amount of number theory: the NPC of the Diophantine binary quad equation</p><p>ax^2 + by + c = 0 </p><p>by Manders and Adelman, see <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022000078900442?via%3Dihub">here</a>.</p><p>(Bill Comment) I tend to think this is an outlier- for the most part, CS theory back in the 1970's did not hard math. </p><p>4) Private Info Retrieval (PIR). k databases each have the same n-bit string and cannot talk to each other. a server wants the ith bit and (in the info-theoretic case) wants the DBs to know NOTHING about the question i. </p><p>Easy results (to understand) 2-server, n^{1/3}. <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/TOPICS/pir/first.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>Hard results: 2-server n^{O(\sqrt{loglogn/log n)},  <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~zdvir/papers/DvirGopi14.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>(I have a website on PIR, not maintained,  <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/TOPICS/pir/pir.html">here</a>.)</p><p>5) Babai's algorithm for GI in quasi-poly time used hard math. </p><p>6) If I knew more CS theory I am sure I would have more papers listed.</p><p>But now its your turn: </p><p>When did you realize Gee, <b>CS theory is harder than (a) you thought, (b) it used to be.</b></p><p><b><br /></b></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>This week my student Daniel Frishberg posted our new preprint “Rapid mixing of the hardcore Glauber dynamics and other Markov chains in bounded-treewidth graphs”, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03898">arXiv:2111.03898</a>. Despite the somewhat-technical title and content, it’s on an easy-to-explain problem, of generating random combinatorial objects (like independent sets in graphs) using random walks. Start with an undirected graph and an empty subset of its vertices, and then repeatedly choose a random vertex, flipping whether it is in or out of the subset whenever the resulting subset remains independent. How many of these steps does it take until the resulting random distribution on independent sets is nearly uniform?</p>

<p>In general, this can take exponentially many steps, but our paper proves that in graphs of bounded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treewidth">treewidth</a> it is only polynomial. Our proof’s exponent depends on the treewidth, but maybe a better proof can get the dependence on treewidth out of the exponent and into the constant factor of the polynomial instead. However, if all you want to do is generate random independent sets, this is not the right way to do it. The point of the paper is less about fast algorithms and more about the connectivity of the space of independent sets. So if you do want a fast algorithm for random generation, what should you do?</p>

<p>This is, unfortunately, an area where some care is required and much of the literature does not take the required care. Problematic issues include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What is the model of computation for arithmetic operations? Much of the literature for the design and analysis of graph algorithms assumes without much attention that all arithmetic operations take unit time. This is a reasonable assumption for small numbers (of at most polynomial magnitude), as occur in many algorithms including the random walk above. In those cases it is a close match to the kind of operation that can be done in a single instruction on a modern CPU. It is not a reasonable assumption for counting algorithms dealing with numbers of exponential magnitude. Counting is an important subproblem for exact random generation, so we need large numbers. Typically, the number of independent sets is linear in the input size, the number of bits required to store this number is linear, and the amount of time needed to perform a single operation on a number this large should again be assumed to involve a bignum-package subroutine. The slow steps are multiplications, which can by <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.4007/annals.2021.193.2.4">recent results of Harvey and van der Hoeven</a> be assumed to take \(O(n\log n)\) time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the model for generating random numbers? If random numbers are generated as bits, this only allows the direct generation of random choices with probabilities that are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyadic_rational">dyadic rational</a>. For independent sets, we need other probabilities. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_sampling">Rejection sampling</a> leads to an algorithm whose running time is itself a random variable, so we need to use expected time or high-probability bounds instead of worst-case time analysis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How is the input presented? For the random-walk method, it is just a graph, but for other algorithms taking advantage of low treewidth we need a good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_decomposition">tree decomposition</a>, and finding one is nontrivial. We should either state explicitly that a tree decomposition is given and that its width rather than the graph width controls the algorithm’s runtime, or factor in the time to find a decomposition and the width of decomposition that we find.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>With that all said, how might we go about computing a random independent set for a given \(n\)-vertex graph of treewidth \(w\), achieving the best theoretical performance?</p>

<p>First, we should find an approximate tree decomposition. There are many known algorithms for this problem, but I think the right choice is the one from the recent paper “An improvement of Reed’s treewidth approximation”, Belbasi and Fürer, WALCOM 2021, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03105">arXiv:2010.03105</a>. It finds a tree decomposition of width at most \(5w\), in time \(O(2^{8.8w}n\log n)\). There are other algorithms with a linear dependence on \(n\), but much worse dependence on \(w\), and the \(n\log n\) part of the bound will be dominated by later steps. We can also bootstrap this decomposition, using dynamic programming on it to find a better decomposition, but I think this is too expensive for the savings it produces.</p>

<p>Second, we should count independent sets. Root the tree decomposition, so that we can talk about the subtree descending from any bag and the subgraph of the given graph that it corresponds to. Then for each bag of the decomposition (in bottom-up order), and each independent subset of the bag, we want to count the number of independent sets in the corresponding subgraph that intersect the bag in the given subset. These independent sets are formed by combining choices of independent sets in child nodes. Therefore, we need to find the numbers of independent sets in each child node that are consistent with the choice of subset at the parent, and multiply them together. Each subset of a bag contributes to exactly one such computation at its parent, so the total number of arithmetic operations for this computation is the product of the number of bags and the number of subsets per bag. With bignum arithmetic, the total time for computing all of these counts is \(O(2^{5w}n^2\log n)\). Our new preprint cites a paper for this subproblem that isn’t sufficiently careful about bignum arithmetic, but still somehow ends up with a slower cubic total time bound; I think they’re just being sloppy and overcounting somehow.</p>

<p>Third, we can then reverse the counting process and step downward through the tree decomposition choosing how the random independent set intersects each bag. When we do this for a bag, we already know the intersection of the independent set with the parent bag. Therefore, all we have to do is choose among the subsets of the child bag that are consistent with that already-made choice, using probabilities that are proportional to the numbers of independent sets that can be formed for each consistent subset. We know these numbers because we already computed them in the second stage. So it’s just a single random choice per bag, which (because it involves bignum probabilities that are not dyadic rational) can reasonably be assumed to take a random amount of time whose expectation is linear. For the overall algorithm, the total expected time is \(O(n^2)\). Also, this stage of the algorithm can be repeated over and over, generating new random independent sets, without having to generate new tree decompositions or new counts.</p>

<p>Putting it all together, it appears that the total time for randomly generating independent sets, using dynamic programming on the tree decomposition to count these sets, and assuming fast bignum arithmetic, is \(O(2^{O(w)}n^2\log n)\) for the preprocessing stages of the algorithm, and then \(O(n^2)\) for each successive generated set.</p>

<ul><li>Union Twist, 1158 Beacon Street in Newton Centre/Four Corners, has been unanimously approved by the City Council for its Special Permit. Union Twist plans to demolish the current building on the site consisting of a dry cleaner and restaurant and build a new 2,300-square foot, one story retail building with 22 on-site parking spaces. For at least the first six months of operation, there will be an appointment only requirement for customers at the store. As their Special Permit has been approved, they can move forward with their state Cannabis Control Commission (CCC) licensing approval process.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Garden Remedies, Newton’s first adult-use retail marijuana store, opened at 697 Washington Street in Newtonville more than two years ago in May 2019. Since opening, Garden Remedies has sold to customers by appointment only. The request from Garden Remedies to amend its current Special Permit to remove the appointment only condition for their retail shop was approved by the City Council Land Use Committee. (The vote was 5-0, with three abstentions.) The full City Council will vote on lifting the appointment only condition at their meeting this Monday, Nov. 15.</li></ul>

We further the study of supercritical tradeoffs in proof and circuit complexity, which is a type of tradeoff between complexity parameters where restricting one complexity parameter forces another to exceed its worst-case upper bound. In particular, we prove a new family of supercritical tradeoffs between depth and size for Resolution, Res(k), and Cutting Planes proofs. For each of these proof systems we construct, for each c &lt;= n^{1-epsilon}, a formula with n^{O(c)} clauses and n variables that has a proof of size n^{O(c)} but in which any proof of size no more than roughly exponential in n^{1-epsilon}/c must necessarily have depth approximately n^c. By setting c = o(n^{1-epsilon}) we therefore obtain exponential lower bounds on proof depth; this far exceeds the trivial worst-case upper bound of n. In doing so we give a simplified proof of a supercritical depth/width tradeoff for tree-like Resolution from [Razborov16]. Finally, we outline several conjectures that would imply similar supercritical tradeoffs between size and depth in circuit complexity via lifting theorems.</div>

Statistics of small subgraph counts such as triangles, four-cycles, and $s$-$t$ paths of short lengths reveal important structural properties of the underlying graph. These problems have been widely studied in social network analysis. In most relevant applications, the graphs are not only massive but also change dynamically over time. Most of these problems become hard in the dynamic setting when considering the worst case. In this paper, we ask whether the question of small subgraph counting over dynamic graphs is hard also in the average case.

We consider the simplest possible average case model where the updates follow an \ErdRen~graph: each update selects a pair of vertices $(u,v)$ uniformly at random and flips the existence of the edge $(u,v)$. 
We develop new lower bounds and matching algorithms in this model for counting four-cycles, counting triangles through a specified point $s$, or a random queried point, and $st$ paths of length $3$, $4$ and $5$. Our results indicate while computing $st$ paths of length $3$, and $4$ are easy in the average case with $O(1)$ update time (note that they are hard in the worst case), it becomes hard when considering $st$ paths of length $5$.

 We introduce new techniques which allow us to get average-case hardness for these graph problems from the worst-case hardness of the Online Matrix vector problem (OMv). Our techniques rely on recent advances in fine-grained average-case complexity. Our techniques advance this literature, giving the ability to prove new lower bounds on average-case dynamic algorithms.</div>

In this paper, we show how one may (efficiently) construct two types of extremal combinatorial objects whose existence was previously conjectural.
   
(*) Panchromatic Graphs: For fixed integer k, a k-panchromatic graph is, roughly speaking, a balanced bipartite graph with one partition class equipartitioned into k colour classes in which the common neighbourhoods of panchromatic k-sets of vertices are much larger than those of k-sets that repeat a colour. The question of their existence was raised by Karthik and Manurangsi [Combinatorica 2020].

(*) Threshold Graphs: For fixed integer k, a k-threshold graph is, roughly speaking, a balanced bipartite graph in which the common neighbourhoods of k-sets of vertices on one side are much larger than those of (k+1)-sets. The question of their existence was raised by Lin [JACM 2018].

Concretely, we provide probability distributions over graphs from which we can efficiently sample these objects in near linear time. These probability distributions are defined via varieties cut out by (carefully chosen) random polynomials, and the analysis of these constructions relies on machinery from algebraic geometry (such as the Lang–Weil estimate, for example). The technical tools developed to accomplish this might be of independent interest.

As applications of our constructions, we show the following conditional time lower bounds on the parameterized set intersection problem where, given a collection of n sets over universe [n] and a parameter k, the goal is to find k sets with the largest intersection.

(*) Assuming ETH, for any computable function F, no $n^{o(k)}$-time algorithm can approximate the parameterized set intersection problem up to factor F(k). This improves considerably on the previously best-known result under ETH due to Lin [JACM 2018], who ruled out any $n^{o(\sqrt{k})}$ time approximation algorithm for this problem.

(*) Assuming SETH, for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and any computable function F, no $n^{k-\varepsilon}$-time algorithm can approximate the parameterized set intersection problem up to factor F(k). No result of comparable strength was previously known under SETH, even for solving this problem exactly.</div>

Kathleen Booth, Cicely Popplewell, Grace Hopper, and Jean Sammet were four pioneers of the field of Programming Languages. They are credited for (co-)creating the first assembly language, programming manual, compiler, and widest-use language (COBOL), the last alongside Mary Hawes and Gertrude Tierney. Popplewell’s name heads the proceedings of the 1962 <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/IFIP">IFIP</a> conference, while Sammet wrote a defining textbook of the field, <em>Programming Languages: History and Fundamentals</em>, in 1969. </p>
<p>
Today Ken and I wonder why the 56-person strong programming committee for the 2022 Principles of Programming Languages conference has only six women.</p>
<p>
If you were asked to name <b>a</b> <em>principle</em> of programming languages, there’s a good chance you’d think of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">Liskov substitution principle</a>, which is named for Barbara Liskov. Of all fields of computing, we would hope that this would be the leader toward gender balance. It is true that across the board in computer science, we are struggling to get over 20% female representation. But we should be doing better than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B6%2F56+%3D+10.714...%5C%25%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{6/56 = 10.714...\%}" class="latex" /> now.	</p>

<p></p><p>
I have always enjoyed the POPL conference. I recall being there ages ago—I was there in 1980 on a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262331842_Theoretical_and_empirical_studies_on_using_program_mutation_to_test_the_functional_correctness_of_programs">paper</a>, “Theoretical and Empirical Studies on Using Program Mutation to Test the Functional Correctness of Programs,” with Timothy Budd, Richard DeMillo, and Frederick Sayward.</p>
<p>
I had planned to do a long post on POPL 2022. This POPL is planned to be a real in-person conference for this coming 2022—not virtual. But I was upset to say the least by the above ratio. </p>
<p>
Ken and I were similarly stopped the week before Halloween. We had intended a post saluting those who aggregate theory of computing blogs and including a list of over <b>50</b> active blogs. We stopped it because, as noted at the end of the <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/11/01/quantum-trick-or-treat/">post</a> that Ken wrote instead, one has to stretch to reach even <b>4</b> mathematics/theory blogs by women. </p>
<p>
Counts of the most recent FOCS and STOC program committees give slightly better percentages. Slightly. For STOC 2022 we count 7 women out of 46, giving This is </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B7%7D%7B46%7D+%3D+0.152...+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \frac{7}{46} = 0.152... " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This is just a notch better. FOCS 2021 (meeting in February 2022) manages to improve both the numerator and the denominator: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B8%7D%7B35%7D+%3D+0.229...+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \frac{8}{35} = 0.229... " class="latex" /></p>
<p>That’s double POPL, and over 20%. But it is still single-digits on a fairly large committee. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Planting a Field </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We’ve led off this post with pioneers of generations back. What about 20–30 years back? That seems to be the time frame alluded to in this statement by Valerie King—whom both of us have known since the late 1980s—in the first-year <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1834336&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">report</a> to NSF of the inaugural <a href="https://sigact.org/tcswomen/">TCS Women meeting</a> in 2018:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “I chaired the STOC program committee last year [<a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2017/">2017</a>], and while there were plenty of women on the committee, what a disappointment it was [in 2017] to see rooms full of men with only a sprinkling of woman in sight. I remember a time when there were more women at FOCS and STOC and It’s hard not to wonder what’s happened, and to want to fix this problem. I think it can lead to a downward spiral, the fewer the women, the more women who do come fill uncomfortable and the fewer that come next time. </em></p><em>
</em><p><em>
Thanks to efforts of Barna [Saha], Sofya [Raskhodnikova] and Virginia [Vassilevska Williams], STOC 2018 seemed different. As I looked around the conference rooms, I actually saw women and it felt good.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
So we wondered if we could take a snapshot of POPL 20 years ago. I (Ken writing this part) counted out the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mleone/language-people.html">“Language People”</a> list that is linked from Wikipedia’s own shorter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_language_researchers">list</a> of programming language researchers. The longer, former list was compiled circa 2000 by Mark Leone, whom I knew as a student in a theory course I taught once in Cornell’s summer session, and who now works at NVIDIA. </p>
<p>
I count <b>319</b> names. I noticed Susan Horwitz, for whom we wrote a <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2014/12/02/susan-horwitz-1955-2014/">memorial</a> in 2014. I did not check whether others are still living, as I viewed this as a generation-ago snapshot. The list is not perfect—it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLU_(programming_language)">CLU</a>-lessly omits Liskov—but it serves the purpose. I included Horwitz in my quick count of women: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++17.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  17. " class="latex" /></p>
<p>That makes a ratio of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B17%2F319+%3D+0.05329...%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{17/319 = 0.05329...}" class="latex" /> Just barely over 5%. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Even with Ken’s little experiment, I cannot understand how the low ratio could be possible with POPL. Here are the <a href="https://sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Diversity/">goals</a> for POPL. Gender equity is in the list, but is seventh. Hmmm. </p>
<p></p><p><br />

<div class="content">
Consider a homogeneous degree $d$ polynomial $f = T_1 + \cdots + T_s$, $T_i = g_i(\ell_{i,1}, \ldots, \ell_{i, m})$ where $g_i$'s are homogeneous $m$-variate degree $d$ polynomials and $\ell_{i,j}$'s are linear polynomials in $n$ variables. We design a (randomized) learning algorithm that given black-box access to $f$, computes black-boxes for the $T_i$'s. The running time of the algorithm is $\text{poly}(n, m, d, s)$ and the algorithm works under some \emph{non-degeneracy} conditions on the linear forms and the $g_i$'s, and some additional technical assumptions $n \ge (md)^2, s \le n^{ d/4} $. The non-degeneracy conditions on $\ell_{i,j}$'s constitute non-membership in a variety, and hence are satisfied when the coefficients of $\ell_{i,j}$'s are chosen uniformly and randomly from a large enough set. The conditions on $g_i$'s are satisfied for random polynomials and also for natural polynomials common in the study of arithmetic complexity like determinant, permanent, elementary symmetric polynomial, iterated matrix multiplication. A particularly appealing algorithmic corollary is the following: Given black-box access to an $f = \mbox{Det}_{r}(L^{(1)}) + \ldots + \mbox{Det}_{r}(L^{(s)})$, where $L^{(k)} = (\ell_{i,j}^{(k)})_{i,j}$ with $\ell_{i,j}^{(k)}$'s being linear forms in $n$ variables chosen randomly, there is an algorithm which in time $\poly(n, r)$ outputs matrices $(M^{(k)})_k$ of linear forms \text{s.t.} there exists a permutation $\pi: [s] \rightarrow [s]$ with $\mbox{Det}_{r}(M^{(k)}) = \mbox{Det}_{r}(L^{(\pi(k))})$.
    
    Our work follows the works of Kayal-Saha(STOC'19) and Garg-Kayal-Saha(FOCS'20) which use lower bound methods in arithmetic complexity to design average case learning algorithms. It also vastly generalizes the result in \cite{Kayal-Saha'19} about learning depth-three circuits, which is a special case where each $g_i$ is just a monomial. At the core of our algorithm is the partial derivative method which can be used to prove lower bounds for generalized depth-three circuits. To apply the general framework in \cite{Kayal-Saha'19, Garg-Kayal-Saha'20}, we need to establish that the non-degeneracy conditions arising out of applying the framework with the partial derivative method are satisfied in the random case. We develop simple but general and powerful tools to establish this, which might be useful in designing average case learning algorithms for other arithmetic circuit models.</div>
