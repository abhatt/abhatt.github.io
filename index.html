<p> As you know, the website for out for a few days, as Lance explained <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/07/technical-difficulties.html">here</a>.</p><p>When I first could not get to the this blog  my thought was</p><p><i>OH, I must have changed some setting by accident. When Lance gets back (he was on vacation) he'll know how to fix it. Bad timing that it happened when he was gone, though prob not an accident- with him on vacation I was at the site more often and had more of a chance to screw things up. AND Lance will tell me what I did and I'll know to not do it again.

average-case, i.e., their objective is to find a policy that maximizes the
expected utility over a known distribution of realizations. However, a policy
that has a good average-case performance may have very poor performance under
the worst-case realization. In this study, we propose to study two variants of
adaptive submodular optimization problems, namely, worst-case adaptive
submodular maximization and robust submodular maximization. The first problem
aims to find a policy that maximizes the worst-case utility and the latter one
aims to find a policy, if any, that achieves both near optimal average-case
utility and worst-case utility simultaneously. We introduce a new class of
stochastic functions, called \emph{worst-case submodular function}. For the
worst-case adaptive submodular maximization problem subject to a $p$-system
constraint, we develop an adaptive worst-case greedy policy that achieves a
$\frac{1}{p+1}$ approximation ratio against the optimal worst-case utility if
the utility function is worst-case submodular. For the robust adaptive
submodular maximization problem subject to a cardinality constraint, if the
utility function is both worst-case submodular and adaptive submodular, we
develop a hybrid adaptive policy that achieves an approximation close to
$1-e^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ under both worst case setting and average case setting
simultaneously. We also describe several applications of our theoretical
results, including pool-base active learning, stochastic submodular set cover
and adaptive viral marketing.

cryptology, complexity and coding theory. In this paper, we connect the tools
from cryptology and complexity theory in the domain of Boolean functions with
low polynomial degree and high sensitivity. It is well known that the
polynomial degree of of a Boolean function and its resiliency are directly
connected. Using this connection we analyze the polynomial degree-sensitivity
values through the lens of resiliency, demonstrating existence and
non-existence results of functions with low polynomial degree and high
sensitivity on small number of variables (upto 10). In this process, borrowing
an idea from complexity theory, we show that one can implement resilient
Boolean functions on a large number of variables with linear size and
logarithmic depth. Finally, we extend the notion of sensitivity to higher order
and note that the existing construction idea of Nisan and Szegedy (1994) can
provide only constant higher order sensitivity when aiming for polynomial
degree of $n-\omega(1)$. In this direction, we present a construction with low
($n-\omega(1)$) polynomial degree and super-constant $\omega(1)$ order
sensitivity exploiting Maiorana-McFarland constructions, that we borrow from
construction of resilient functions. The questions we raise identify novel
combinatorial problems in the domain of Boolean functions.

(MDPs) that is simple to implement and boasts strong theoretical convergence
guarantees. However, the computational cost of value iteration quickly becomes
infeasible as the size of the state space increases. Various methods have been
proposed to overcome this issue for value iteration in large state and action
space MDPs, often at the price, however, of generalizability and algorithmic
simplicity. In this paper, we propose an intuitive algorithm for solving MDPs
that reduces the cost of value iteration updates by dynamically grouping
together states with similar cost-to-go values. We also prove that our
algorithm converges almost surely to within \(2\varepsilon / (1 - \gamma)\) of
the true optimal value in the \(\ell^\infty\) norm, where \(\gamma\) is the
discount factor and aggregated states differ by at most \(\varepsilon\).
Numerical experiments on a variety of simulated environments confirm the
robustness of our algorithm and its ability to solve MDPs with much cheaper
updates especially as the scale of the MDP problem increases.

restriction is that the circuits which take a matrix input are unchanged by a
permutation applied simultaneously to the rows and columns of the matrix. Under
such restrictions we have polynomial-size circuits for computing the
determinant but no subexponential size circuits for the permanent. Here, we
consider a more stringent symmetry requirement, namely that the circuits are
unchanged by arbitrary even permutations applied separately to rows and
columns, and prove an exponential lower bound even for circuits computing the
determinant. The result requires substantial new machinery. We develop a
general framework for proving lower bounds for symmetric circuits with
restricted symmetries, based on a new support theorem and new two-player
restricted bijection games. These are applied to the determinant problem with a
novel construction of matrices that are bi-adjacency matrices of graphs based
on the CFI construction. Our general framework opens the way to exploring a
variety of symmetry restrictions and studying trade-offs between symmetry and
other resources used by arithmetic circuits.

The influence of a set of variables on a Boolean function has three separate definitions in the literature, the first due to Ben-Or and Linial (1989), the second due to Fischer et al. (2002) and Blais (2009) and the third due to Tal (2017). The goal of the present work is to carry out a comprehensive study of the notion of influence of a set of variables on a Boolean function. To this end, we introduce a           definition of this notion using the auto-correlation function. A modification of the definition leads to the notion of pseudo-influence. Somewhat surprisingly, it turns out that the auto-correlation based definition of influence is equivalent to the definition introduced by Fischer et al. (2002) and Blais (2009) and the notion of pseudo-influence is equivalent to the definition of influence considered by Tal (2017). Extensive analysis of influence and pseduo-influence as well as the Ben-Or and Linial notion of influence is carried out and the relations between these notions are established.</div>

We analyze the Fourier growth, i.e. the $L_1$ Fourier weight at level $k$ (denoted $L_{1,k}$), of various well-studied classes of "structured" $\mathbb{F}_2$-polynomials. This study is motivated by applications in pseudorandomness, in particular recent results and conjectures due to [CHHL19,CHLT19,CGLSS20] which show that upper bounds on Fourier growth (even at level $k=2$) give unconditional pseudorandom generators.

  Our main structural results on Fourier growth are as follows:

  - We show that any symmetric degree-$d$ $\mathbb{F}_2$-polynomial $p$ has $L_{1,k}(p) \le \Pr[p=1] \cdot O(d)^k$, and this is tight for any constant $k$. This quadratically strengthens an earlier bound that was implicit in [RSV13].

  - We show that any read-$\Delta$ degree-$d$ $\mathbb{F}_2$-polynomial $p$ has $L_{1,k}(p) \le \Pr[p=1] \cdot (k \Delta d)^{O(k)}$.

  - We establish a composition theorem which gives $L_{1,k}$ bounds on disjoint compositions of functions that are closed under restrictions and admit $L_{1,k}$ bounds.

  Finally, we apply the above structural results to obtain new unconditional pseudorandom generators and new correlation bounds for various classes of $\mathbb{F}_2$-polynomials.</div>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072421_weinberg_closecrop-1030x580.jpg" alt="Steven Weinberg sitting in front of a chalkboard covered in equations" /></figure></div>



<p>Steven Weinberg was, perhaps, the last truly towering figure of 20th-century physics.  In 1967, he wrote a <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.19.1264">3-page paper</a> saying in effect that as far as he could see, two of the four fundamental forces of the universe—namely, electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force—had actually been the same force until a tiny fraction of a second after the Big Bang, when a broken symmetry caused them to decouple.  Strangely, he had developed the math underlying this idea for the strong nuclear force, and it didn’t work there, but it <em>did</em> seem to work for the weak force and electromagnetism.  Steve noted that, if true, this would require the existence of two force-carrying particles that hadn’t yet been seen — the W and Z bosons — and would <em>also </em>require the existence of the famous Higgs boson.</p>



<p>By 1979, enough of this picture had been confirmed by experiment that Steve shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Sheldon Glashow—Steve’s former high-school classmate—as well as with Abdus Salam, both of whom had separately developed pieces of the same puzzle.  As arguably the central architect of what we now call the Standard Model of elementary particles, Steve was in the ultra-rarefied class where, had he <em>not</em> won the Nobel Prize, it would’ve been a stain on the prize rather than on him.</p>



<p>Steve once recounted in my hearing that Richard Feynman initially heaped scorn on the electroweak proposal.  Late one night, however, Steve was woken up by a phone call.  It was Feynman.  “I believe your theory now,” Feynman announced.  “Why?” Steve asked.  Feynman, being Feynman, gave some idiosyncratic reason that he’d worked out for himself.</p>



<p>It used to happen more often that someone would put forward a bold new proposal about the most fundamental laws of nature … and then the experimentalists would <em>actually go out and confirm it</em>.  Besides with the Standard Model, though, there’s approximately <em>one</em> other time that that’s happened in the living memory of most of today’s physicists.  Namely, when astronomers discovered in 1998 that the expansion of the universe was accelerating, apparently due to a dark energy that behaved like Einstein’s long-ago-rejected cosmological constant.  Very few had expected such a result.  There was one prominent exception, though: Steve Weinberg had <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.2607">written in 1987</a> that he saw no reason why the cosmological constant shouldn’t take a nonzero value that was still tiny enough to be consistent with galaxy formation and so forth.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>In his long and illustrious career, one of the <em>least</em> important things Steve did, six years ago, was to play a major role in recruiting me and my wife Dana to UT Austin.  The first time I met Steve, his first question to me was “have we met before?  you look familiar.”  It turns out that he’d met my dad, Steve Aaronson, way back in the 1970s, when my dad (then a young science writer) had interviewed Weinberg for a magazine article.  I was astonished that Weinberg would remember such a thing across decades.</p>



<p>Steve was then gracious enough to take me, Dana, and both of my parents out to dinner in Austin as part of my and Dana’s recruiting trip.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/weinberg3.jpg"><img width="422" alt="" src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/weinberg3.jpg" class="wp-image-5618" height="317" /></a></figure></div>



<p>We talked, among other things, about Telluride House at Cornell, where Steve had lived as an undergrad in the early 1950s and where I’d lived as an undergrad almost half a century later.  Steve said that, while he loved the intellectual atmosphere at Telluride, he tried to have as little to do as possible with the “self-government” aspect, since he found the political squabbles that convulsed many of the humanities majors there to be a waste of time.  I burst out laughing, because … well, imagine you got to have dinner with James Clerk Maxwell, and he opened up about some ridiculously specific pet peeve from his college years, and it was <em>your</em> ridiculously specific pet peeve from <em>your</em> college years.</p>



<p>(Steve claimed to us, not entirely convincingly, that he was a mediocre student at Cornell, more interesting in “necking” with his fellow student and future wife Louise than in studying physics.)</p>



<p>After Dana and I came to Austin, Steve was kind enough to invite me to the high-energy theoretical physics lunches, where I chatted with him and the other members of his group every week (or better yet, simply listened).  I’d usually walk to the faculty club ten minutes early.  Steve, having arrived by car, would be sitting alone in an armchair, reading a newspaper, while he waited for the other physicists to arrive by foot.  No matter how scorching the Texas sun, Steve would <em>always</em> be wearing a suit (usually a tan one) and a necktie, his walking-cane by his side.  I, typically in ratty shorts and t-shirt, would sit in the armchair next to him, and we’d talk—about the latest developments in quantum computing and information (Steve, a perpetual student, would pepper me with questions), or his recent work on nonlinear modifications of quantum mechanics, or his memories of Cambridge, MA, or climate change or the anti-Israel protests in Austin or whatever else.  These conversations, brief and inconsequential as they probably were to him, were highlights of my week. </p>



<p>There was, of course, something a little melancholy about getting to know such a great man only in the twilight of his life.  To be clear, Steve Weinberg in his mid-to-late 80s was <em>far</em> more cogent, articulate, and quick to understand what was said to him than just about anyone you’d ever met in their prime.  But then, after a short conversation, he’d have to leave for a nap.  Steve was as clear-eyed and direct about his age and impending mortality as he was about everything else.  “Scott!” he once greeted me.  “I just saw the announcement for your physics colloquium about quantum supremacy.  I hope I’m still alive next month to attend it.”</p>



<p>(As it happens, the colloquium in question was on November 9, 2016, the day we learned that Trump would become president.  I offered to postpone the talk, since no one could concentrate on physics on such a day.  While several of the physicists agreed that that was the right call, Steve convinced me to go ahead with the following message: “I sympathize, but I do want to hear you … There is some virtue in just plowing on.”)</p>



<p>I sometimes felt, as well, like I was speaking with Steve across a cultural chasm even greater than the half-century that separated us in age.  Steve enjoyed nothing more than to discourse at length, in his booming New-York-accented baritone, about opera, or ballet, or obscure corners of 18th-century history.  It would be easy to feel like a total philistine by comparison … and I did.  Steve also told me that he never reads blogs or other social media, since he’s unable believe any written work is “real” unless it’s published, ideally on paper.  I could only envy such an attitude.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>If you <em>did</em> try to judge by the social media that he never read, you might conclude that Steve would be remembered by the wider world less for any of his epochal contributions to physics than for a single viral quote of his:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil — that takes religion.</p></blockquote>



<p>I can testify that Steve fully lived his atheism.  Four years ago, I invited him (along with many other UT colleagues) to the <em>brit milah</em> of my newborn son Daniel.  Steve said he’d be happy to come over our house another time (and I’m happy to say that he did a year later), but not to witness any body parts being cut.</p>



<p>Despite his hostility to Judaism—along with every other religion—Steve was a vociferous supporter of the state of Israel, almost to the point of making me look like Edward Said or Noam Chomsky.  For Steve, Zionism was not in spite of his liberal, universalist Enlightenment ideals but because of them.</p>



<p>Anyway, there’s no need even to wonder whether Steve had any sort of deathbed conversion.  He’d laugh at the thought.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>In 2016, Steve published <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Explain-World-Discovery-Modern-Science/dp/0062346660"><em>To Explain the World</em></a>, a history of human progress in physics and astronomy from the ancient Greeks to Newton (when, Steve says, the scientific ethos reached the form that it still basically has today).  It’s unlike any other history-of-science book that I’ve read.  Of course I’d read other books about Aristarchus and Ptolemy and so forth, but I’d never read a modern writer treating them not as historical subjects, but as <em>professional colleagues merely separated in time.</em>  Again and again, Steve would redo ancient calculations, finding errors that had escaped historical notice; he’d remark on how Eratosthenes or Kepler could’ve done better with the data available to them; he’d grade the ancients by how much of modern physics and cosmology they’d correctly anticipated.</p>



<p><em>To Explain the World</em> was savaged in reviews by professional science historians.  Apparently, Steve had committed the unforgivable sin of “Whig history”: that is, judging past natural philosophers by the standards of today.  Steve clung to the naïve, debunked, scientistic notions that there’s such a thing as “actual right answers” about how the universe works; that we today are, at any rate, much closer to those right answers than the ancients were; and that we can <em>judge</em> the ancients by how close they got to the right answers that we now know.</p>



<p>As I read the sneering reviews, I kept thinking: so suppose Archimedes, Copernicus, and all the rest were brought back from the dead.  Who would they rather talk to: historians seeking to explore every facet of their misconceptions, like anthropologists with a paleolithic tribe; or Steve Weinberg, who’d want to bring them up to speed as quickly as possible so they could continue the joint quest?</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>When it comes to the foundations of quantum mechanics, Steve <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/01/19/trouble-with-quantum-mechanics/">took the view</a> that <em>no</em> existing interpretation is satisfactory, although the Many-Worlds Interpretation is perhaps the least bad of the bunch.  Steve felt that our reaction to this state of affairs should be to <em>test quantum mechanics more precisely</em>—for example, by looking for tiny nonlinearities in the Schrödinger equation, or other signs that QM itself is only a limit of some more all-encompassing theory.  This is, to put it mildly, not a widely-held view among high-energy physicists—but it provided a fascinating glimpse into how Steve’s mind works.</p>



<p>Here was, empirically, the most successful theoretical physicist alive, and again and again, his response to conceptual confusion was not to ruminate more about basic principles but to <em>ask for more data</em> or <em>do a more detailed calculation</em>.  He never, ever let go of a short tether to the actual testable consequences of whatever was being talked about, or future experiments that might change the situation.</p>



<p>(Steve worked on string theory in the early 1980s, and he remained engaged with it for the rest of his life, for example by recruiting the string theorists Jacques Distler and Willy Fischler to UT Austin.  But he later soured on the prospects for getting testable consequences out of string theory within a reasonable timeframe.  And he once complained to me that the papers he’d read about “It from Qubit,” AdS/CFT, and the black hole information problem had had “too many words and not enough equations.”)</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>Steve was, famously, about as hardcore a reductionist as has ever existed on earth.  He was a reductionist not just in the usual sense that he believed there <em>are</em> fundamental laws of physics, from which, together with the initial conditions, everything that happens in our universe can be calculated in principle (if not in practice), at least probabilistically.  He was a reductionist in the stronger sense that he thought the quest to discover the fundamental laws of the universe had a special pride of place among all human endeavors—a place not shared by the many sciences devoted to the study of complex emergent behavior, interesting and important though they might be.</p>



<p>This came through clearly in Steve’s <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2002/10/24/is-the-universe-a-computer/">critical review</a> of Stephen Wolfram’s <em>A New Kind of Science</em>, where Steve (Weinberg, that is) articulated his views of why “free-floating” theories of complex behavior can’t take the place of a reductionistic description of our actual universe.  (Of course, I was <em>also</em> highly critical of <em>A New Kind of Science</em> in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206089">my review</a>, but for somewhat different reasons than Steve was.)  Steve’s reductionism was also clearly expressed in his testimony to Congress in support of continued funding for the Superconducting Supercollider.  (Famously, Phil Anderson testified <em>against</em> the SSC, arguing that the money would better be spent on condensed-matter physics and other sciences of emergent behavior.  The result: Congress did cancel the SSC, and it redirected precisely zero of the money to other sciences.  But at least Steve lived to see the LHC dramatically confirm the existence of the Higgs boson, as the SSC would have.)</p>



<p>I, of course, have devoted my career to theoretical computer science, which you might broadly call a “science of emergent behavior”: it tries to figure out the ultimate possibilities and limits of computation, taking the underlying laws of physics as given.  Quantum computing, in particular, takes as its input a physical theory that was already known by 1926, and studies what can be done with it.  So you might expect me to disagree passionately with Weinberg on reductionism versus holism.</p>



<p>In reality, I have a hard time pinpointing any substantive difference.  Mostly I see a difference in <em>opportunities</em>: Steve saw a golden chance to contribute something to the millennia-old quest to discover the fundamental laws of nature, at the tail end of the heroic era of particle physics that culminated in what we now call the Standard Model.  He was brilliant enough to seize that chance.  I didn’t see a similar chance: possibly because it no longer existed; almost certainly because, even if it did, I wouldn’t have had the right mind for it.  I found a different chance, to work at the intersection of physics and computer science that was finally kicking into high gear at the end of the 20th century.  Interestingly, while I came to that intersection from the CS side, quite a few who were originally trained as high-energy physicists ended up there as well—including a star PhD student of Steve Weinberg’s named John Preskill.</p>



<p>Despite his reductionism, Steve was as curious and enthusiastic about quantum computation as he was about a hundred other topics beyond particle physics—he even ended his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lectures-Quantum-Mechanics-Steven-Weinberg/dp/1107028728">quantum mechanics textbook</a> with a chapter about Shor’s factoring algorithm.  Having said that, a central <em>reason</em> for his enthusiasm about QC was that he clearly saw how demanding a test it would be of quantum mechanics itself—and as I mentioned earlier, Steve was open to the possibility that quantum mechanics might not be exactly true.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>It would be an understatement to call Steve “left-of-center.”  He believed in higher taxes on rich people like himself to service a robust social safety net.  When Trump won, Steve remarked to me that most of the disgusting and outrageous things Trump would do could be reversed in a generation or so—but not the aggressive climate change denial; that actually <em>could</em> matter on the scale of centuries.  Steve made the news in Austin for <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2016/01/27/the-brief/">openly defying</a> the Texas law forcing public universities to allow concealed carry on campus: he said that, regardless of what the law said, firearms would not be welcome in <em>his</em> classroom.  (Louise, Steve’s wife for 67 years and a professor at UT Austin’s law school, also wrote perhaps the <a href="https://law.utexas.edu/faculty/publications/2002-When-Courts-Decide-Elections-The-Constitutionality-of-Bush-v-Gore">definitive scholarly takedown</a> of the shameful <em>Bush vs. Gore</em> Supreme Court decision, which installed George W. Bush as president.)</p>



<p>All the same, during the “science wars” of the 1990s, Steve was <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1996/08/08/sokals-hoax/">scathing</a> about the academic left’s postmodernist streak and deeply sympathetic to what Alan Sokal had done with his <em>Social Text </em>hoax.  Steve also once told me that, when he (like other UT faculty) was required to write a statement about what he would do to advance Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, he submitted just a single sentence: “I will seek the best candidates, without regard to race or sex.”  I remarked that he might be one of the only academics who could get away with that.</p>



<p>I confess that, for the past five years, knowing Steve was a greater source of psychological strength for me than, from a rational standpoint, it probably should have been.  Regular readers will know that I’ve spent months of my life agonizing over various nasty things people have said me about on Twitter and Reddit—that I’m a sexist white male douchebag, a clueless techbro STEMlord, a neoliberal Zionist shill, and I forget what else.</p>



<p>But I lately <em>have</em> had a secret emotional weapon that helped somewhat: namely, the certainty that Steven Weinberg had more intellectual power in a single toenail clipping than these Twitter-attackers had collectively experienced over the course of their lives.  It’s like, have you heard the joke where two rabbis are arguing some point of Talmud, and then God speaks from a booming thundercloud to declare that the first rabbi is right, and then the second rabbi says “OK fine, now it’s 2 against 1?”  For the W and Z bosons and Higgs boson that <em>you</em> predicted to turn up at the particle accelerator is not <em>exactly</em> God declaring from a thundercloud that the way your mind works is aligned with the way the world actually is—Steve, of course, would wince at the suggestion—but it’s about the closest thing available in this universe.  My secret emotional weapon was that I knew the man who’d experienced this, arguably more than any of the 7.6 billion other living humans, and not only did that man not sneer at me, but by some freakish coincidence, he seemed to have reached roughly the same views as I had on &gt;95% of controversial questions where we both had strong opinions.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>My final conversations with Steve Weinberg were about a laptop.  When covid started in March 2020, Steve and Louise, being in their late 80s, naturally didn’t want to take chances, and rigorously sheltered at home.  But an issue emerged: Steve couldn’t install Zoom on his paleolithic computer, and so couldn’t participate in the virtual meetings of his own group, nor could he do Zoom calls with his daughter and granddaughter.  While as a <em>theoretical</em> computer scientist, I don’t normally volunteer myself as tech support staff, I decided that an exception was more than warranted in this case.  The quickest solution was to configure one of my own old laptops with everything Steve needed and bring it over to his house.</p>



<p>Later, Steve emailed me to say that, while the laptop had worked great and been a lifesaver, he’s finally bought his own laptop, so I should come by to pick mine up.  I delayed and delayed with that, but finally decided I should do it before leaving Austin at the beginning of this summer.  So I emailed Steve to tell him I’d be coming.  He replied to me asking Louise to leave the laptop on the porch — but the email was addressed only to me, not her.</p>



<p>At that moment, I knew something had changed: only a year before, incredibly, <em>I’d</em> been more senile and out-of-it as a 39-year-old than Steve had been as an 87-year-old.  What I didn’t know at the time was that Steve had sent that email from the hospital when he was close to death.  It was the last I heard from him.</p>



<p>(Once I learned what was going on, I did send a get-well note, which I hope Steve saw, saying that I hoped he appreciated that I <em>wasn’t</em> praying for him.)</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>Besides the quote about good people, bad people, and religion, the other quote of Steve’s that he never managed to live down came from the last pages of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-Three-Minutes-Modern-Universe/dp/0465024378"><em>The First Three Minutes</em></a>, his classic 1970s popularization of big-bang cosmology:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The more the universe seems comprehensible, the more it also seems pointless.</p></blockquote>



<p>In the 1993 epilogue, Steve tempered this with some more hopeful words, nearly as famous:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The effort to understand the universe is one of the very few things which lifts human life a little above the level of farce and gives it some of the grace of tragedy.</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s not my purpose here to resolve the question of whether life or the universe have a point.  What I can say is that, even in his last years, Steve never for a nanosecond <em>acted</em> as if life was pointless.  He already had all the material comforts and academic renown anyone could possibly want.  He could have spent all day in his swimming pool, or listening to operas.  Instead, he continued publishing textbooks—a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lectures-Quantum-Mechanics-Steven-Weinberg/dp/1107028728">quantum mechanics textbook</a> in 2012, an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lectures-Astrophysics-Steven-Weinberg/dp/1108415075">astrophysics textbook</a> in 2019, and a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1108841767/?tag=pfamazon01-20">“Foundations of Modern Physics” textbook</a> in 2021 (!).  As recently as this year, he continued <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/hep-th?searchtype=author&amp;query=Weinberg%2C+Steven">writing papers</a>—and not just “great man reminiscing” papers, but hardcore technical papers.  He continued writing with nearly unmatched lucidity for a general audience, in the <em>New York Review of Books</em> and elsewhere.  And I can attest that he continued peppering visiting speakers with questions about stellar evolution or whatever else they were experts on—because, more likely than not, he had redone some calculation himself and gotten a subtly different result from what was in the textbooks.</p>



<p>If God exists, I can’t believe He or She would find nothing more interesting to do with Steve than to torture him for his unbelief.  More likely, I think, God is right now talking to Steve the same way Steve talked to Aristarchus in <em>To Explain the World</em>: “yes, you were close about the origin of neutrino masses, but here’s the part you were missing…”  While, of course, Steve is redoing God’s calculation to be sure.</p>

Merge Resolution (MRes [Beyersdorff et al. J. Autom. Reason.'2021] ) is a refutational proof system for quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). Each line of MRes consists of clauses with only existential literals, together with information of countermodels stored as merge maps. As a result, MRes has strategy extraction by design. The QRAT [Heule et al. J. Autom. Reason.'2017] proof system was designed to capture QBF preprocessing. QRAT can simulate both the expansion-based proof system $\forall$Exp+Res and CDCL-based QBF proof system LD-Q-Res. 

A family of false QBFs called SquaredEquality formulas were introduced in [Beyersdorff et al. J. Autom. Reason.'2021] and shown to be easy for MRes but need exponential size proofs in Q-Res, QU-Res, CP+$\forall$red, $\forall$Exp+Res, IR-calc and reductionless LD-Q-Res. As a result none of these systems can simulate MRes. In this paper, we show a short QRAT refutation of the SquaredEquality formulas. We further show that QRAT strictly p-simulates MRes. 
Besides highlighting the power of QRAT system, this work also presents the first simulation result for MRes.</div>

This blog stopped working, a P v NP paper was published on the ACM Transactions of Computing website and my personal emails were getting marked as spam. All is better, I hope.</p><p>Years ago I donated the URL computationalcomplexity.org to the <a href="https://www.computationalcomplexity.org/">Computational Complexity Conference</a>, coincidentally held this past week, with the condition that I could continue to use the "blog" subdomain for this blog.

<p>I recently finished my qualifying exam for which I surveyed worst-case to average-case reductions for problems in NP. As part of my survey, I reviewed recent results on average-case hardness in P (a.k.a. average-case fine-grained hardness). I would like to give an overview of some of these results in a series of blog posts, and I want to start by giving some motivations.</p>



<p><strong>Why do we care about average-case fine-grained hardness?</strong></p>



<p>(i) We hope to explain why we are struggling to find faster algorithms for problems in P such as DNA sequencing even for some random large datasets.</p>



<p>(ii) Average-case hard problems in P is useful to cryptography. For example, constructing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function">one-way functions</a> (i.e., functions that are easy to compute but hard to invert) based on worst-case complexity assumptions such as NP <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnot%5Csubseteq&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\not\subseteq" class="latex" /> BPP has been a long-standing open question. In this context, “easy” means polynomial-time computable. If we consider “easy” to be computable in time like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E%7B100%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="O(n^{100})" class="latex" /> instead, then a natural alternative question is whether we can construct such one-way functions based on worst-case fine-grained complexity assumptions. Another example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work">proof of work</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-48071-4_10">[DN92]</a>. When a miner tries to mine the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a>, the miner is asked to solve a random puzzle, that is average-case hard but still tractable, and then the miner needs to prove they have indeed solved the puzzle through efficient protocols. An interesting and more recent follow-up is proof of useful work <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/203.pdf">[BRSV17b]</a>, which proposes that instead of wasting computing power on a random puzzle that comes from nowhere, we can first reduce a computational task of practical interest to multiple random puzzles and then ask the miner to solve those puzzles.</p>



<p>The most common approach for proving average-case fine-grained hardness is arguably worst-case to average-case reduction, i.e., reducing an arbitrary instance to a number of random instances of which the distribution is polynomial-time sampable. Before I give concrete examples, I want to describe a general recipe for designing such worst-case to average-case reductions. (Some reader might notice that the step 3 of the recipe is same as the argument for proving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_self-reducibility#Permanent_of_a_matrix">computing permanent is self-reducible</a> <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/New-Directions-In-Testing-Lipton/fb2eba4d69bdab34c2d240380d4370be2feeacb9">[L91]</a>, which essentially uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_decodable_code#The_Reed%E2%80%93Muller_code">local decoding for Reed-Muller codes</a>.)</p>

(This step can be replaced by decoding algorithms for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction">Reed-Solomon codes</a> to handle larger errors of average-case solver.)</li><li>(The above steps already show that evaluating <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f_{L}" class="latex" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d+1" class="latex" /> uniformly random inputs is as hard as solving <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="L" class="latex" /> for worst-case input.) If we want to show <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="L" class="latex" /> itself is average-case fine-grained hard, it suffices to give a reduction from computing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7BL%7D%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f_{L}(x)" class="latex" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cin%5Cmathbf%7BF%7D_%7Bp%7D%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x\in\mathbf{F}_{p}^n" class="latex" /> back to solving <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="L" class="latex" />.</li></ol>



<p>Notice that the above general recipe reduces a worst-case instance to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d+1" class="latex" /> random instances at the step 3, and thus, we want <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d" class="latex" /> to be small (like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7Bo%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n^{o(1)}" class="latex" />) such that it does not blow up the total runtime significantly. Typically, the step 4 would also blow up the runtime, and sometimes it depends on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d" class="latex" />. For all the problems (or the techniques) in this series, I will explicitly quantify the runtime blow-up in the step 4 (if there is any) and explain how small we want <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d" class="latex" /> to be (if the blow-up depends on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d" class="latex" />).</p>



<p>Now let us go through a concrete example. Consider one of the flagship problems in fine-grained complexity — orthogonal vector problem (OV): Given <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%3D%5C%7Bx_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X=\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}" class="latex" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y%3D%5C%7By_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cy_n%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Y=\{y_1,\dots,y_n\}" class="latex" />, where each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i%2Cy_i%5Cin%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5E%7Bd%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x_i,y_i\in\{0,1\}^{d'}" class="latex" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%27%5Cin%5Comega%28%5Clog+n%29%5Ccap+n%5E%7Bo%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d'\in\omega(\log n)\cap n^{o(1)}" class="latex" />, decide if there are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i%2Cy_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x_i,y_j" class="latex" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+x_i%2Cy_j%5Crangle%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\langle x_i,y_j\rangle=0" class="latex" />. It is known OV has no sub-quadratic algorithm assuming strong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_time_hypothesis">exponential-time hypothesis</a> (SETH) <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-27836-8_101">[W05]</a>, and there is a generalization of OV called <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" />-OV problem that has no <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E%7Bk-o%281%29%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="O(n^{k-o(1)})" class="latex" /> algorithm under the same assumption <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3300150.3300158">[W18]</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Polynomial evaluation.</strong> Given an OV instance <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%2CY&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X,Y" class="latex" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%27%3Dn%5E%7Bo%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d'=n^{o(1)}" class="latex" />, we construct a degree-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2d%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="2d'" class="latex" /> polynomial <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7B%5Ctextrm%7BOV%7D%7D%28X%2CY%29%3A%3D%5Csum_%7Bi%2Cj%5Cin%5Bn%5D%7D%5Cprod_%7Bt%5Cin%5Bd%27%5D%7D%281-x_%7Bi%2Ct%7Dy_%7Bi%2Ct%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f_{\textrm{OV}}(X,Y):=\sum_{i,j\in[n]}\prod_{t\in[d']}(1-x_{i,t}y_{i,t})" class="latex" /> over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BF%7D_%7Bp%7D%5E%7B2nd%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbf{F}_{p}^{2nd'}" class="latex" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%3En%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="p&gt;n^2" class="latex" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bi%2Ct%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x_{i,t}" class="latex" /> denotes the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" />-th coordinate of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i%5Cin+X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x_i\in X" class="latex" />. Observe that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7B%5Ctextrm%7BOV%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f_{\textrm{OV}}" class="latex" /> simply enumerates all the pairs of vectors and counts the number of orthogonal pairs for the OV instance, and obviously counting is at least as hard as decision. Using the aforementioned general recipe, it follows immediately that evaluating <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7B%5Ctextrm%7BOV%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f_{\textrm{OV}}" class="latex" /> requires <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E%7B2-o%281%29%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="O(n^{2-o(1)})" class="latex" /> time for average case assuming randomized version of SETH. This result was shown in <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/202.pdf">[BRSV17a]</a>, and analogously, they constructed a polynomial for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" />-OV, which implies an average-case time hierarchy assuming randomized SETH.</p>



<p>However, the polynomial evaluation problem is algebraic. Next, let us consider a natural combinatorial problem — counting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" />-cliques in an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" />-vertices graph (for simplicity, think of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" /> as a large constant). This problem has worst-case complexity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B%5CTheta%28t%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n^{\Theta(t)}" class="latex" /> assuming ETH <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82508832.pdf">[CHKX06]</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Counting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" />-cliques.</strong> It was first shown in <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/R2/gc.pdf">[GR18]</a> that there is an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cwidetilde%7BO%7D%28n%5E2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\widetilde{O}(n^2)" class="latex" />-time reduction from counting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" />-cliques in any graph to counting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" />-cliques with error probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3C%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="&lt;\frac{1}{4}" class="latex" /> in some polynomial-time sampable random graph. The proof also follows our general recipe. First, we construct a degree-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbinom%7Bt%7D%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\binom{t}{2}" class="latex" /> polynomial <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7Bt%5Ctextrm%7B-clique%7D%7D%28X%29%3A%3D%5Csum_%7B%5Ctextrm%7Bsize-%7Dt%5C%2C+T%5Csubseteq+%5Bn%5D%7D%5Cprod_%7Bi%3Cj%5Cin+T%7D+X_%7Bi%2Cj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f_{t\textrm{-clique}}(X):=\sum_{\textrm{size-}t\, T\subseteq [n]}\prod_{i&lt;j\in T} X_{i,j}" class="latex" /> over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BF%7D_%7Bp%7D%5E%7Bn%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbf{F}_{p}^{n^2}" class="latex" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%3En%5Et&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="p&gt;n^t" class="latex" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> is the adjacency matrix. Observe that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7Bt%5Ctextrm%7B-clique%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f_{t\textrm{-clique}}" class="latex" /> counts <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" />-cliques by enumerating each size-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" /> subset of vertices and checking whether it is a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" />-clique. It remains to work out the step 4 of the general recipe. This was done by a gadget reduction, that runs in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cwidetilde%7BO%7D%28p%5E%7Bt%5E2%7Dn%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\widetilde{O}(p^{t^2}n)" class="latex" /> time, from evaluating <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7Bt%5Ctextrm%7B-clique%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f_{t\textrm{-clique}}" class="latex" /> on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y%5Cin%5Cmathbf%7BF%7D_%7Bp%7D%5E%7Bn%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Y\in\mathbf{F}_{p}^{n^2}" class="latex" /> to counting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" />-cliques in an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cwidetilde%7BO%7D%28p%5E%7Bt%5E2%7Dn%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\widetilde{O}(p^{t^2}n)" class="latex" />-vertices graph <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/R2/gc.pdf">[GR18]</a>.</p>



<p>Although this gadget reduction is nice, I will not explain it here, because later works <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08247">[BBB19,</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06591">DLW20]</a> show that if the polynomial constructed at the step 2 has certain structure, then there is a general technique to reduce evaluating this polynomial back to the original problem (at the cost of requiring smaller error probability of average-case solver), which I will discuss in the next post. Finally, let me point out an issue in the previous paragraph — <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" /> is too large for the gadget reduction to be useful! We need <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%3En%5Et&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="p&gt;n^t" class="latex" /> (note <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5Et&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n^t" class="latex" /> is a trivial upper bound of the number of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" />-cliques) such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%7Bt%5Ctextrm%7B-clique%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f_{t\textrm{-clique}}" class="latex" /> indeed outputs the number of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="t" class="latex" />-cliques, but the gadget reduction takes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cwidetilde%7BO%7D%28p%5E%7Bt%5E2%7Dn%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\widetilde{O}(p^{t^2}n)" class="latex" /> time, and moreover, we do not know how to find a prime <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3En%5Et&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="&gt;n^t" class="latex" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cwidetilde%7BO%7D%28n%5E2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\widetilde{O}(n^2)" class="latex" /> time. This issue was handled in <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/R2/gc.pdf">[GR18]</a> using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem">Chinese remainder theorem</a>. Specifically, we choose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28t%5Clog+n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="O(t\log n)" class="latex" /> many distinct primes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="p_i" class="latex" />‘s upper bounded by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28t%5Clog+n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="O(t\log n)" class="latex" /> whose product is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3En%5Et&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="&gt;n^t" class="latex" /> (the existence of such primes follows from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem">asymptotic distribution of the prime numbers</a>).

(We can use Chinese remaindering with errors <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/18.850672">[GRS99]</a> to handle larger error probability.)</p>



<p>Hopefully, the above examples give you a flavor of worst-case to average-case reductions for fine-grained hard problems. As promised, in the next post, I will continue to discuss the new technique in  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08247">[BBB19,</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06591">DLW20]</a>, which automatizes the step 4 of the general recipe by requiring more structural properties for the polynomial constructed in the step 2 of the general recipe.</p>

<p class="justify-text">Integrals appear everywhere in all scientific fields, and their numerical computation is an active area of research. In the playbook of approximation techniques, my personal favorite is “la méthode de Laplace”, a must-know for students that like to cut integrals into pieces, that comes with lots of applications.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We will be concerned with integrals of the form $$I(t) =  \int_K h(x) e^{ \, – \, t f(x) } dx, $$ where \(K\) is compact (bounded and closed) subset of \(\mathbb{R}^d\), and \(h\) and \(f\) are two real-valued functions defined on \(K\) such that the integral is well defined for large enough \(t \in \mathbb{R}\). The goal is to obtain an asymptotic equivalent when \(t\) tends to infinity.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Within machine learning, as explained below, this is useful where computing and approximating integrals is important. This thus comes up naturally in Bayesian inference where \(t\) will be the number of observations in a statistical model. But let’s start with presenting this neat asymptotic result that Laplace discovered for a particular one-dimensional case in 1774 [<a href="http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k77596b/f32">1</a>].</p>



<h2>Laplace approximation</h2>



<p>Let’s first state the main result. Assume that:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>\(h\) is continuous on \(K\) and that \(f\) is twice continuously differentiable on \(K\).</li><li>\(f\) has a strict global minimizer \(x_\ast\) on \(K\), which is in the interior of \(K\), where the gradient \(f^\prime(x_\ast)\) is thus equal to zero, and where the Hessian \(f^{\prime \prime}(x_\ast)\) is a positive definite matrix (it is always positive semi-definite because \(x_\ast\) is a local minimizer of \(f\)); moreover, \(h(x_\ast) \neq 0\).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">Then, as \(t\) tends to infinity, we have the following asymptotic equivalent: $$ I(t) \sim \frac{h(x_\ast)}{\sqrt{ \det f^{\prime \prime}(x_\ast) }} \Big( \frac{2\pi}{t}\Big)^{d/2}  e^{ \, – \, t f(x_\ast) }.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Where does it come from?</strong> The idea is quite simple: for \(t&gt;0\), the exponential term \(e^{ \, – \, t f(x) }\) is largest when \(x\) is equal to the minimizer \(x_\ast\). Hence only contributions close to \(x_\ast\) will count in the integral. Then we can do Taylor expansions of the two functions around \(x_\ast\), as \(h(x) \approx h(x_\ast)\) and \(f(x) \approx f(x_\ast) + \frac{1}{2} ( x – x_\ast)^\top f^{\prime \prime}(x_\ast) (x-x_\ast)\), and approximate \(I(t)\) as $$ I(t) \approx \int_K h(x_\ast) \exp\Big[ – t f(x_\ast) \ – \frac{t}{2} ( x – x_\ast)^\top f^{\prime \prime}(x_\ast) (x-x_\ast)\Big] dx.$$ We can then make a change of variable \(y = \sqrt{t} f^{\prime \prime}(x_\ast)^{1/2}( x – x_\ast)\) (where \(f^{\prime \prime}(x_\ast)^{1/2}\) is the positive square root of \(f^{\prime \prime}(x_\ast)\)), to get, with the Jacobian of the transformation leading to the term \(  (\det f^{\prime \prime}(x_\ast) )^{1/2} t^{d/2} \): $$I(t) \approx \frac{ h(x_\ast) e^{ \, – \, t f(x_\ast) }}{( \det f^{\prime \prime}(x_\ast) )^{1/2}t^{d/2} } \int_{\sqrt{t}f^{\prime \prime}(x_\ast)^{1/2}( K \ – x_\ast)} \!\!\! \exp\big[ – \frac{1}{2} y^\top  y  \big] dy.$$ Since \(x_\ast\) is in the interior of \(K\), when \(t\) tends to infinity, the set \(\sqrt{t} f^{\prime \prime}(x_\ast)^{1/2} ( K \ – x_\ast)\) tends to \(\mathbb{R}^d\) (see illustration below), and we obtain the usual Gaussian integral that leads to the normalizing constant of the Gaussian distribution, which is equal to \((2\pi)^{d/2} \).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="544" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Klaplace-1024x288.png" class="wp-image-6263" height="153" />Left: set \(K\) with \(x_\ast\) in its interior. Right: set \(\sqrt{t} f^{\prime \prime}(x_\ast)^{1/2} ( K \ – x_\ast)\), which is a translated (by \(x_\ast\)), tilted (by \(f^{\prime\prime}(x_\ast)\)) and scaled (by \(\sqrt{t}\)) version of \(K\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Formal proof.</strong> Let’s first make our life simpler: without loss of generality, we may assume that \(f(x_\ast) = 0\) (by subtracting the minimal value), that \(f^{\prime \prime}(x_\ast) = I\) (by a change of variable whose Jacobian is the square root of \(f^{\prime \prime}(x_\ast)\), leading to the determinant term), and that \(x_\ast = 0\). With the dominated convergence theorem (which was unfortunately unknown to me when I first learned about the method in high school, forcing students to cut integrals into multiple pieces), the proof sketch above is almost exact. We simply need a simple argument, based on the existence of a continuous function \(g: K \to \mathbb{R}\) such that $$ g(x) = \frac{f(x) } {\|  x  \|^2}$$ for \(x \neq 0\) and \(g(0) = \frac{1}{2}\) (here \(\| \! \cdot \! \|\) denotes the standard Euclidean norm). The function \(g\) is trivially defined and continuous on \(K \backslash \{0\}\), the value and continuity at zero is a simple consequence of the Taylor expansion $$ f(x) = f(0) + f^\prime(0)^\top x + \frac{1}{2} x^\top f^{\prime\prime}(0)x + o( \| x\|^2) = \frac{1}{2} \| x\|^2 + o( \| x\|^2). $$</p>



<p class="justify-text">We may then use the same change of variable as above to get the <em>equality</em>: $$I(t) =  \frac{ 1 }{ t^{d/2}  }  \int_{\sqrt{t}  K } h\big( \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}  y\big) \exp\big[ – \frac{1}{2} y^\top y \cdot g\big(  \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}} y\big) \big] dy.$$ We can write the integral part of the expression above as $$J(t) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} a(y,t) dy, $$ with $$a(y,t) = 1_{ y \in \sqrt{t} K } h\big(  \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}}  y\big)\exp\big[ – \frac{1}{2} y^\top y \cdot g\big( \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}} y\big) \big].$$ We have for all \(t&gt;0\) and \(y \in \mathbb{R}^d\), \(|a(y,t)| \leqslant \max_{z \in K} | h(z)| \exp\Big[ – \| y\|^2 \cdot \min_{ z \in K } g(z) \Big]\), which is integrable because \(h\) is continuous on the compact set \(K\) and thus bounded, and \(g\) is strictly positive on \(K\) (since \(f\) is strictly positive except at zero as \(0\) is a strict global minimum), and by continuity, its minimal value is strictly positive. Thus by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominated_convergence_theorem">dominated convergence theorem</a>: $$\lim_{t \to +\infty} J(t) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \big( \lim_{t \to +\infty} a(y,t) \big) dy = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\exp\big[ – \frac{1}{2} y^\top y \big] dy = ( 2\pi)^{d/2}.$$ This leads to the desired result since \(I(t) = J(t) / t^{d/2}\).</p>



<h2>Classical examples</h2>



<p>Two cute examples are often mentioned as applications (adapted from [2]).</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation">Stirling’s formula</a></strong>. We have, by definition of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function">Gamma function</a> \(\Gamma\), and the change of variable \(u = tx\):<br />$$\Gamma(1+t) = \int_0^\infty \!\! e^{-u} u^{t} du = \int_0^\infty \!\! e^{-tx}t^t x^t t dx = t^{t+1} \int_0^\infty \!\! e^{-t(x-\log x)} dx.$$ Since \(x \mapsto x\, – \log x\) is minimized at \(x=1\) with second derivative equal to \(1\), we get: $$\Gamma(1+t) \sim t^{t+1} e^{-t} \sqrt{2\pi / t} = \big( \frac{t}{e} \big)^t \sqrt{ 2\pi t}.,$$ which is exactly Stirling’s formula, often used when \(t\) is an integer, and then, \(\Gamma(1+t) = t!\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Convergence of \(L_p\)-norms to the \(L_\infty\)-norm.</strong> We consider the \(L_p\)-norm of a positive twice continuously differentiable function on the compact set \(K\), with a unique global maximizer at \(x_\ast\) in the interior of \(K\). Then we can write its \(L_p\)-norm \(\|g\|_p\) through $$\| g\|_p^p = \int_K g(x)^p dx = \int_K e^{ p \log g(x)} dx.$$ The function \(f: x \mapsto\  – \log g(x)\) has gradient \(f^\prime(x) = \ – \frac{1}{g(x)}g^\prime(x)\) and Hessian \(f^{\prime\prime}(x)=\  – \frac{1}{g(x)} g^{\prime\prime}(x) + \frac{1}{g(x)^2} g^\prime(x) g^\prime(x)^\top .\) At \(x_\ast\), we get \(f^{\prime\prime}(x_\ast) = \ – \frac{1}{g(x_\ast)} g^{\prime \prime}(x_\ast)\). Thus, using Laplace’s method, we have: $$ \|g\|_p^p =  \frac{A}{p^{d/2}} g(x_\ast)^p (1 + o(1) ),$$ with \(\displaystyle A = \frac{(2\pi g(x_\ast))^{d/2}}{(\det (-g^{\prime\prime}(x_\ast)))^{1/2}}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Taking the power \(1/p\), we get: $$ \|g\|_p = \exp \big( \frac{1}{p} \log \|g\|_p^p\big) =  \exp \Big( \frac{1}{p} \log A \ – \frac{d}{2p} \log p +   \log g(x_\ast) + o(1/p) \Big).$$ This leads to, using \(\exp(u) = 1+u + o(u)\) around zero: $$ \| g\|_p = g(x_\ast) \Big( 1 – \frac{d}{2p} \log p + \frac{1}{p} \log A + o(1/p) \Big) = g(x_\ast) \Big( 1 – \frac{d}{2p} \log p + O(1/p) \Big).$$ A surprising fact is that the second-order term does not depend on anything but \(g(x_\ast)\) (beyond \(p\) and \(d\)). Note that this applies also to continuous log-sum-exp functions.</p>



<h2>Applications in Bayesian inference</h2>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out that Laplace’s motivation in deriving this general technique for approximating integrals was exactly Bayesian inference, which he in fact essentially re-discovered and extended (see an interesting account <a href="https://ebrary.net/118879/history/laplaces_bayesian_analysis_1774_1781">here</a>). Let me now explain how Laplace’s method applies.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We consider a parameterized family of probability distributions with density \(p(x|\theta)\) with respect to some base measure \(\mu\) on \(x \in \mathcal{X}\), with \(\theta \in \Theta \subset \mathbb{R}^d\) a set of parameters. </p>



<p class="justify-text">As a running example (the one from Laplace in 1774), we consider the classical Bernoulli distribution for \(x \in \mathcal{X} = \{0,1\}\), and densities with respect to the counting measure, that is, the parameter \(\theta \in [0,1]\) is the probability that \(x=1\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>From frequentist to Bayesian inference. </strong>We are given \(n\) independent and identically distributed observations \(x_1,\dots,x_n \in \mathcal{X}\), from an unknown probability distribution \(q(x)\). One classical goal of statistical inference is to find the parameter \(\theta \in \Theta\) so that \(p(\cdot| \theta)\) is as close to \(q\) as possible.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In the frequentist framework, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation">maximum likelihood estimation</a> amounts to maximizing $$ \sum_{i=1}^n \log p(x_i | \theta)$$ with respect to \(\theta \in \Theta\). It comes with a series of guarantees, in particular (but not only) when \(q = p(\cdot | \theta)\) for a certain \(\theta \in \Theta\). For our running example, the maximum likelihood estimator \(\hat{\theta}_{\rm ML} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i\) is the frequency of non-zero outcomes.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In the Bayesian framework, the data are assumed to be generated by a certain \(\theta\), but now with \(\theta\) itself random with some prior probability density \(p(\theta)\) (with respect to the Lebesgue measure). Statistical inference typically does not lead to a point estimator (like the maximum likelihood estimator), but to the full posterior distribution of the parameter \(\theta\) given the observations \(x_1,\dots,x_n\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The celebrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem">Bayes’ rule</a> states that the posterior density \(p(\theta | x_1,\dots,x_n)\) can be written as: $$p(\theta | x_1,\dots,x_n) = \frac{ p(\theta) \prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i|\theta) }{p(x_1,\dots,x_n)},$$ where \(p(x_1,\dots,x_n)\) is the marginal density of the data (once the parameter has been marginalized out).</p>



<p class="justify-text">If pressured, a Bayesian will end up giving you a point estimate, but a true Bayesian will not give away the maximum a posteriori estimate (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_a_posteriori_estimation#Limitations">here</a> for some reasons why), but if you give him or her a loss function (e.g., the square loss), he or she will give away (reluctantly) the estimate that minimizes the posterior risk (e.g., the posterior mean for the square loss).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Bernoulli and Beta distributions. </strong>In our running Bernoulli example for coin tossing, it is standard to put a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior">conjugate prior</a> on \(\theta \in [0,1]\), which is here a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution">Beta distribution</a> with parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), that is, $$p(\theta) = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha) \Gamma(\beta)} \theta^{\alpha-1} ( 1- \theta)^{\beta-1}.$$ The posterior distribution is then also a Beta distribution with parameters \(\alpha + \sum_{i=1}^n x_i\) and \(\beta + \sum_{i=1}^n ( 1- x_i)\). The posterior mean is $$\mathbb{E} [ \theta | x_1,\dots,x_n ] = \frac{\alpha+ \sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n + \alpha + \beta},$$ and corresponds to having pre-observed \(\alpha\) ones and \(\beta\) zeroes (this is sometimes referred to as Laplace smoothing). However, it is rarely possible to compute the posterior distribution in closed form, hence the need for approximations.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Laplace approximation. </strong>Thus, in Bayesian inference, integrals of the form $$ \int_{\Theta} h(\theta) p(\theta) \prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i|\theta) d\theta$$ for some function \(h: \Theta \to \mathbb{R}\), are needed. For example, computing the marginal likelihood corresponds to \(h=1\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">By taking logarithms, we can write $$\int_{\Theta} h(\theta) p(\theta) \prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i|\theta) d\theta = \int_{\Theta} h(\theta) \exp\Big(  \log p(\theta) + \sum_{i=1}^n \log p(x_i|\theta) \Big) d\theta, $$ and with \(f_n(\theta) = \ – \frac{1}{n} \log p(\theta) \ – \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \log p(x_i|\theta),\) we have an integral in Laplace form, that is, $$\int_{\Theta} h(\theta) \exp( -n f_n(\theta))d\theta,$$ with a function \(f_n\) that now varies with \(n\). This simple variation does not matter as because of the law of large numbers, when \(n\) is large, \(f_n(\theta)\) tends to a fixed function \(\mathbb{E} \big[ \log p(x|\theta) \big]\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">The Laplace approximation thus requires to compute the minimizer of \(f_n(\theta)\), which is exactly the maximum a posteriori estimate \(\hat{\theta}_{\rm MAP}\), and use the approximation: $$ \int_{\Theta} h(\theta) \exp( -n f_n(\theta))d\theta \approx (2\pi / n)^{d/2} \frac{h( \hat{\theta}_{\rm MAP})}{(\det f_n^{\prime \prime}( \hat{\theta}_{\rm MAP}))^{1/2}} \exp( – n f_n( \hat{\theta}_{\rm MAP})).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Gaussian posterior approximation.</strong> Note that the Laplace approximation exactly corresponds to approximating the log-posterior density by a quadratic form and thus approximating the posterior by a Gaussian distribution with mean \(\hat{\theta}_{\rm MAP}\) and covariance matrix \(\frac{1}{n} f_n^{\prime \prime}( \hat{\theta}_{\rm MAP})^{-1}\). Note that Laplace’s method gives one natural example of such Gaussian approximation and that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Bayesian_methods">variational inference</a> can be used to find better ones.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Example.</strong> We consider the Laplace approximation of a Beta random variable, that is a Gaussian with mean at the mode of the original density and variance equal to the inverse of the second derivative of the log-density. Below, the mean \(\alpha / (\alpha +\beta)\) is set to a constant, while the variance shrinks due to an increasing \(\alpha+\beta\) (which corresponds to the number of observations in the Bayesian interpretation above).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img width="598" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/plot_beta-3.gif" class="wp-image-6335" height="248" />Left: densities. Right: negative log-densities translated so that they have matched first two derivatives at their minimum.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We see above, that for large variances (small \(\alpha +\beta\)), the Gaussian approximation is not tight, while it becomes tighter as the mass gets concentrated around the mode.</p>



<h2>Extensions</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>High-order expansion.</strong> The approximation is based on Taylor expansions of the functions \(h\) (order \(0\)) and \(f\) (order \(2\)). In order to obtain extra terms of the form \(t^{d/2+\nu}\), for \(\nu\) a positive integer, we need higher-order derivatives of \(h\) and \(f\). In more than one dimension, that quickly gets complicated (see, e.g., [3, 4]).</p>



<p class="justify-text">One particular case which is interesting in one dimension is \(h(x) \sim A ( x- x_\ast)^\alpha\), and \(f(x)-f(x_\ast) = B|x-x_\ast|^{\beta}\). Note that \(\alpha=0\) and \(\beta=2\) corresponds to the regular case. A short calculation gives the equivalent \(I(t) \sim \frac{2}{2+\beta}  \frac{A \Gamma\big( \frac{\alpha+1}{\beta} \big)}{(tB)^{\frac{\alpha+1}{\beta}}}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_phase_approximation">Stationary phase approximation</a>.</strong> We can also consider integrals of the form $$I(t) = \int_K h(x) \exp( – i t f(x) ) dx,$$ where \(i\) is the usual square root of \(-1\). Here, the main contribution also comes from vectors \(x\) where the gradient of \(f\) is zero. This can be further extended to more general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_steepest_descent">complex integrals</a>.</p>



<h2>When Napoléon meets Laplace and Lagrange</h2>



<p class="justify-text">As a conclusion, I cannot resist mentioning a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace#I_had_no_need_of_that_hypothesis">classical (potentially not totally authentic) anecdote</a> about encounters between Laplace and Lagrange, two mathematical heroes of mine, and Napoléon, as described in [<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/31246/31246-pdf.pdf">5</a>, page 343]:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote justify-text"><p>Laplace went in state to beg Napoleon to accept a copy of his work, and the following account of the interview is well authenticated, and so characteristic of all the parties concerned that I quote it in full. Someone had told Napoleon that the book contained no mention of the name of God; Napoleon, who was fond of putting embarrassing questions, received it with the remark, “M. Laplace, they tell me you have written this large book on the system of the universe, and have never even mentioned its Creator.” Laplace, who, though the most supple of politicians, was as stiff as a martyr on every point of his philosophy, drew himself up and answered bluntly, “Je n’avais pas besoin de cette hypothèse-là.” Napoleon, greatly amused, told this reply to Lagrange, who exclaimed, “Ah! c’est une belle hypothèse; ça explique beaucoup de choses.”</p><cite>W.

The classic Impagliazzo--Nisan--Wigderson (INW) psesudorandom generator (PRG) (STOC `94) for space-bounded computation uses a seed of length $O(\log n \cdot \log(nwd/\varepsilon))$ to fool ordered branching programs of length $n$, width $w$, and alphabet size $d$ to within error $\varepsilon$. A series of works have shown that the analysis of the INW generator can be improved for the class of $\textit{permutation}$ branching programs or the more general $\textit{regular}$ branching programs, improving the $O(\log^2 n)$ dependence on the length $n$ to $O(\log n)$ or $\tilde{O}(\log n)$.  However, when also considering the dependence on the other parameters, these analyses still fall short of the optimal PRG seed length $O(\log(nwd/\varepsilon))$.
    
    In this paper, we prove that any ``spectral analysis'' of the INW generator requires seed length $$\Omega\left(\log n\cdot \log\log(\min\{n,d\})+\log n\cdot \log(w/\varepsilon)+\log d\right)$$ to fool ordered permutation branching programs of length $n$, width $w$, and alphabet size $d$ to within error $\varepsilon$.  By ``spectral analysis'' we mean an analysis of the INW generator that relies only on the spectral expansion of the graphs used to construct the generator; this encompasses all prior analyses of the INW generator.  Our lower bound matches the upper bound of Braverman--Rao--Raz--Yehudayoff (FOCS 2010, SICOMP 2014) for regular branching programs of alphabet size $d=2$ except for a gap between their $O(\log n \cdot \log\log n)$ term and our $O(\log n \cdot \log\log \min\{n,d\})$ term.  It also matches the upper bounds of Koucky--Nimbhorkar--Pudlak (STOC 2011), De (CCC 2011), and Steinke (ECCC 2012) for constant-width ($w=O(1)$) permutation branching programs of alphabet size $d=2$ to within a constant factor.  
    
    To fool permutation branching programs in the stronger measure of $\textit{spectral norm}$, we prove that any spectral analysis of the INW generator requires a seed of length $\Omega(\log n\cdot \log\log n+\log n\cdot\log(1/\varepsilon)+\log d)$ when the width is at least polynomial in $n$ ($w=n^{\Omega(1)}$), matching the recent upper bound of Hoza--Pyne--Vadhan (ITCS `21) to within a constant factor.</div>

We introduce a new graph parameter called linear upper maximum induced
matching width \textsc{lu-mim width}, denoted for a graph $G$ by $lu(G)$.
We prove that the smallest size of the \textsc{obdd} for $\varphi$,
the monotone 2-\textsc{cnf} corresponding to $G$, is sandwiched 
between $2^{lu(G)}$ and $n^{O(lu(G))}$. 
The upper bound is based on a combinatorial statement that might 
be of an independent interest.
We show that the bounds in terms of this parameter are best possible.

The new parameter is closely related to two existing parameters:
linear maximum induced matching width (\textsc{lmim width}) and linear symmetric induced matching width 
(\textsc{lsim width}). We prove that \textsc{lu-mim width} lies strictly in between these two
parameters, being dominated by \textsc{lsim width} and dominating \textsc{lmim width}.
We conclude that neither of the two existing parameters can be used instead of \textsc{lu-mim width}
to characterize the size of \textsc{obdd}s for monotone $2$-\textsc{cnf}s and this justifies introduction
of the new parameter.</div>

Recently, there has been exciting progress in understanding the complexity of distributions. Here, the goal is to quantify the resources required to generate (or sample) a distribution. Proving lower bounds in this new setting is more challenging than in the classical setting, and has yielded interesting new techniques and surprising applications. In this work, we initiate a study of the complexity of sampling with limited memory, and prove small-space analogs of several results previously known only for sampling in AC$^0$.

1. We exhibit an explicit boolean function $b:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ that cannot be computed by width $2^{\Omega(n)}$ read-once branching programs (ROBPs), even on average, but such that $(\mathbf{U}_n,b(\mathbf{U}_n))$ can be exactly sampled by ROBPs of width $O(n)$.

2. We exhibit an explicit boolean function $b:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ such that any distribution sampled by an ROBP of width $2^{\Omega(n)}$ has statistical distance $\frac{1}{2}-2^{-\Omega(n)}$ from $(\mathbf{U}_n,b(\mathbf{U}_n))$. We show that any such $b$ witnesses exponentially small correlation bounds against ROBPs, and we extend these results to hold for the unknown-order setting.

3. We show that any distribution sampled by an ROBP of width $2^{\Omega(n)}$ has statistical distance $1-2^{-\Omega(n)}$ from any distribution that is uniform over a good code. More generally, we obtain sampling lower bounds for any list decodable code, which are nearly tight. Using a known connection, we also obtain data structure lower bounds for storing codewords.

Along the way, we prove a direct product theorem and several equivalence theorems. These tools offer a generic method to construct distributions with strong sampling lower bounds, and translate these lower bounds into correlation bounds against ROBPs. As an application of our direct product theorem, we show a strong complexity separation between sampling with AC$^0$ circuits and sampling with ROBPs.</div>

Andrey Bulatov, Martin Dyer and David Richerby, and Jin-Yi Cai and Xi Chen are the authors of three papers awarded the 2021 Gödel Prize. The citations by the <a href="https://sigact.org/prizes/gödel/citation2021.html">ACM</a> and <a href="https://eatcs.org/index.php/component/content/article/1-news/2885-2021-05-07-21-20-13">EATCS</a> say clearly that the papers not the people win the prize, but our “blog invariant” is to show photos of people at the top, so there they are.</p>
<p>
Today we congratulate the people—not the papers—and tell some of the technical story behind this richly deserved award.</p>
<p>
Dick and I have intended to write about this since the prize was announced in early May. Travel and personal events have slowed the blog, plus in my case, June was by far the most pressing month of the “chess cheating pandemic” since chess moved online, and that carried into July. The award to our friend Jin-Yi—who has been a faculty colleague of both of us—is the “something else about UW Madison on our mind” that was mentioned in the June 20 <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/06/20/the-shape-of-this-summer/">post</a>, during which chess cases arrived in real time. I am thankful that this month, to judge by the weekly roundups of games by <a href="https://en.chessbase.com/">ChessBase</a> and <a href="https://theweekinchess.com/">The Week in Chess</a>, most major tournaments are back to being played in-person—where the yearly volume of cases coming to my attention has been on either side of ten, rather than in middle triple digits.</p>
<p>
That the papers win the award calls something else to mind: We can no longer point to an “original manuscript” with papers being electronic. Perhaps the continued rise of <em>non-fungible tokens</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFTs</a>) will restore this distinction. Tim Berners-Lee recently <a href="https://www.cnn.com/style/article/tim-berners-lee-nft-auction/index.html">created</a> and auctioned off an NFT of his original code for the World Wide Web. This may be done to prize-winning papers in the future. Then the prize money could create an inherent base value, such as we discussed for “semi-fungible tokens” at the end of this <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/04/01/computer-science-gets-noted/">post</a>, so that the prize really would go to the papers. </p>

The famous 1975 <a href="https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/2272652">theorem</a> of Richard Ladner showed that if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP+%5Cneq+P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{NP \neq P}}" class="latex" /> then plenty of intermediate languages exist, but no problem in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BS%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathcal{S}}" class="latex" /> can be among them.

<p></p><p><br />
Here <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%28C_j%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\alpha(C_j)}" class="latex" /> means the ordered tuple of values <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%28x_i%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\alpha(x_i)}" class="latex" /> of the variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x_i}" class="latex" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{C_j}" class="latex" />. If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CGamma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\Gamma}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{D}" class="latex" /> are considered part of the instance—where they must be finite—the problem is <em>uniform</em>, but if they are fixed (and possibly infinite), it is <em>nonuniform</em>. For a simple analogy: for every fixed context-free grammar <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" />, its language <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%28G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{L(G)}" class="latex" /> belongs to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" />, but a much stronger fact is that the uniform acceptance problem <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA_%7BCFG%7D+%3D+%5C%7B%5Clangle+G%2Cx%5Crangle%3A+x+%5Cin+L%28G%29%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A_{CFG} = \{\langle G,x\rangle: x \in L(G)\}}" class="latex" /> also belongs to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" />. Another relaxation is to allow different domains <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{D_i}" class="latex" /> for different variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x_i}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>
In the Boolean case, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{D}" class="latex" /> is fixed to be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\{0,1\}}" class="latex" />. We can now say what Schaefer and Creignou-Hermann proved. Schaefer showed that every nonuniform Boolean CSP with finite <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CGamma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\Gamma}" class="latex" /> is either in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" />-complete. He showed the former holds only when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CGamma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\Gamma}" class="latex" /> falls into one of six explicit cases, where which case is also decidable in polynomial time given <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CGamma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\Gamma}" class="latex" />. Creignou and Hermann gave a similar result for Boolean #CSP but with a smaller list of cases—because there are cases where the decision problem is in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" /> but the counting problem remains <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{\#P}}" class="latex" />-complete. A simple such case is where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CGamma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\Gamma}" class="latex" /> has only the relation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR+%3D+%5C%7B%281%2C0%29%2C%280%2C1%29%2C%281%2C1%29%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{R = \{(1,0),(0,1),(1,1)\}}" class="latex" />, which defines monotone <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathrm%7B2SAT%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathrm{2SAT}}" class="latex" />.</p>

</p><p></p><h2> Extending the Reach </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Also in the 1990s, Tomás Feder and Moshe Vardi wrote <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/167088.167245">two</a> <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S0097539794266766?journalCode=smjcat">papers</a> on extending Schaefer’s dichotomy to a wider class of problems. To quote the first sentence of the latter’s abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> This paper starts with the project of finding a large subclass of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" /> which exhibits a dichotomy. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The first step was to go to larger domains <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{D}" class="latex" />. For example, consider <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD+%3D+%5C%7B1%2C2%2C3%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{D = \{1,2,3\}}" class="latex" />. Take <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR+%3D+%5C%7B%281%2C2%29%2C%282%2C3%29%2C%281%2C3%29%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{R = \{(1,2),(2,3),(1,3)\}}" class="latex" />, which is simply the relation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cneq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\neq}" class="latex" /> on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{D}" class="latex" />. Given an undirected graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" />, its edges become the tuples. The resulting CSP is satisfiable if and only if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> is 3-colorable. Of course, this is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" />-complete. Feder and Vardi arrived at this by going down from large subclasses of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" /> defined by logic in which Ladner-type constructions can still be expressed, so that dichotomy does <em>not</em> hold. When they imposed all of their conditions, they were left with nonuniform CSPs, and conjectured dichotomy for their decision problems.</p>
<p>
The corresponding question for counting problems was solved <a href="https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~abulatov/papers/counting-acm.pdf">first</a>, by Bulatov. Dyer and Richerby <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.3879.pdf">followed</a> by simplifying Bulatov’s proof in a way that also allows deciding whether a given finite <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%5CGamma%2CD%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{(\Gamma,D)}" class="latex" /> falls into one of the polynomial-time cases (assuming <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P+%5Cneq+P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{\#P \neq P}}" class="latex" /> to begin with). The latter task runs in polynomial time with an oracle for testing what they call <em>strong balance</em>, which in turn polynomial-time mapping-reduces to Graph Isomorphism—so by Laci Babai’s celebrated theorem they can decide in time quasi-polynomial in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%5CGamma%7C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{|\Gamma|}" class="latex" /> whether it is a hard or easy case.</p>
<p>
Finally—and not awarded any of this prize money—a 2017 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03021">paper</a> by Bulatov proved dichotomy for the decision case of nonuniform CSPs. Independently, so did a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01914">paper</a> by Dmitriy Zhuk. We will explore just a few of the underlying ideas in the next section. </p>

<p>which are generally called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_function_(statistical_mechanics)">partition functions</a>.

Thus, the dichotomy theorems that Jin-Yi and Xi have obtained for complex weighted CSPs take matters into the quantum realm.

</p><p></p><h2> Some of the Ideas </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
One key idea can be approached as generalizing a familiar feature of linear algebra. Suppose we take some number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\ell}" class="latex" /> of vectors of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> that belong to a linear subspace <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" />. We can arrange them into an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell+%5Ctimes+k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\ell \times k}" class="latex" /> matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" />. Now let us multiply <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> on the left by a row vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%3D+%28a_1%2C%5Cdots%2Ca_%5Cell%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{a = (a_1,\dots,a_\ell)}" class="latex" />. Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BaM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{aM}" class="latex" /> is another vector of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />. This vector belongs to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" /> because it is just a linear combination of our <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\ell}" class="latex" />-many vectors in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>
The insight for abstraction is that we can regard <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{a}" class="latex" /> as having been applied individually to each of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> columns of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" />. We got one new <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />-tuple from this application, but it still belonged to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" />. So now, let us consider “multiplying” <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> on the left by an arbitrary <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\ell}" class="latex" />-ary function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bh%28x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_%5Cell%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{h(x_1,\dots,x_\ell)}" class="latex" />, so that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BhM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{hM}" class="latex" /> is always a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />-tuple. And let us relax <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" /> to be any (finite) set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR+%5Csubseteq+D%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{R \subseteq D^k}" class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{D}" class="latex" /> is our (finite) domain. </p>

For <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD+%3D+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{D = \{0,1\}}" class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%2B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{+}" class="latex" /> is the same as exclusive-or, it has the property that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bh%28x%2Cy%2Cy%29+%3D+h%28y%2Cy%2Cx%29+%3D+x%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{h(x,y,y) = h(y,y,x) = x}" class="latex" />. This property is named for Anatoly Maltsev, who used it long before any of this complexity work began. It turned out to be a key to demarcating the easy cases for the dichotomy in higher dimensions. Affine relations were already the lone easy case in Creignou-Hermann for Boolean #CSP, while we can now crisply state Schaefer’s original dichotomy for decision CSP: affine, majority-of-3, <em>and</em>, <em>or</em>, plus two trivial cases where the all-zero or all-one assignment always works, are the polymorphisms that characterize the SAT-like problems in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>
A second basic idea is to re-cast the counting problems as ones of counting <em>homomorphisms</em> between relational structures. For instance, let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> be any graph and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_r%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{K_r}" class="latex" /> the complete graph on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" /> nodes. A homomorphism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bh%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{h}" class="latex" /> has the property that when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28u%2Cv%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{(u,v)}" class="latex" /> is an edge of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28h%28u%29%2Ch%28v%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{(h(u),h(v)}" class="latex" /> is an edge of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_r%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{K_r}" class="latex" />—in particular, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bh%28u%29+%5Cneq+h%28v%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{h(u) \neq h(v)}" class="latex" />. This is possible if and only if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" />-colorable. This approach was greatly enhanced in a 1998 <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.40.2693">paper</a> by Peter Jeavons and its follow-ups with other authors. It was particularly useful to the decidability part of Dyer and Richerby’s paper.</p>
<p>
A third idea used by Cai and Chen originated in a 2010 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.5659.pdf">paper</a> of theirs with Pinyan Lu for the case of non-negative weights. It is to stratify the sum in (<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/feed/#partitionfn">1</a>) over all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt+%5Cleq+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{t \leq n}" class="latex" /> by mapping </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f%28a_1%2C%5Cdots%2Ca_t%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7B%5Calpha%3A+%5Calpha%28x_1%29%3Da_1%2C%5Cdots%2C%5Calpha%28x_t%29%3Da_t%7D+%5C%3B%5C%3B%5C%3B+%5Cprod_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5Em+w%28%5Calpha%28C_j%29%2CR_j%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  f(a_1,\dots,a_t) = \sum_{\alpha: \alpha(x_1)=a_1,\dots,\alpha(x_t)=a_t} \;\;\; \prod_{j=1}^m w(\alpha(C_j),R_j). " class="latex" /></p>
<p>With <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt+%3D+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{t = n}" class="latex" /> this is just a single evaluation; with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{t=0}" class="latex" /> this is the original function. They create an oracle that either evaluates the whole sum or allows progressing from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{t-1}" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{t}" class="latex" />. They create a matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%5E%7Bt-1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{d^{t-1}}" class="latex" /> rows for the possible fixed parts <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cvec%7Ba%7D+%3D+%28a_1%2C%5Cdots%2Ca_%7Bt-1%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\vec{a} = (a_1,\dots,a_{t-1})}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{d}" class="latex" /> columns for the possible choices of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba_t+%3D+%5Calpha%28x_t%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{a_t = \alpha(x_t)}" class="latex" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd+%3D+%7CD%7C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{d = |D|}" class="latex" />. The entries are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%5B%5Cvec%7Ba%7D%2Cc%5D+%3D+f%28a_1%2C%5Cdots%2Ca_%7Bt-1%7D%2Cc%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M[\vec{a},c] = f(a_1,\dots,a_{t-1},c)}" class="latex" />, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%5B%5Cvec%7Ba%7D%2C%5Ccdot%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M[\vec{a},\cdot]}" class="latex" /> stands for the row vector over all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc+%5Cin+D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c \in D}" class="latex" />. The oracle, given <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cvec%7Ba%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\vec{a}}" class="latex" />, returns the multiple of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%5B%5Cvec%7Ba%7D%2C%5Ccdot%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M[\vec{a},\cdot]}" class="latex" /> that normalizes the first non-zero entry to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1}" class="latex" />, or the all-zero vector if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%5B%5Cvec%7Ba%7D%2C%5Ccdot%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M[\vec{a},\cdot]}" class="latex" /> is all zero. </p>
<p>
A big extra challenge in the complex-weights case is how to handle cancellations, as begun in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4728">paper</a> by Cai, Chen, and Lu. Implementing the oracle efficiently requires the Maltsev property, a kind of “proto-unitarity” condition on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> (under which <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> has at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{d}" class="latex" /> pairwise linearly independent rows and every two such rows are orthogonal), and a third property they call the “Type Partition” condition to avert blowup in the number of queries. Whether the classification they get is decidable remains open.</p>
<p>
Here is where we say to go to the papers for details, but we hope we have expressed ideas and their motivation as a guide. We have a little more to say about interpretation and making further progress on the dichotomy.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Taking Dichotomy Further </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Progress on the counting dichotomy increases the “internal evidence” for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P+%5Cneq+P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{\#P \neq P}}" class="latex" />, which of course is implied by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP+%5Cneq+P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{NP \neq P}}" class="latex" />. To paraphrase how our blogging friends Scott and Lance and Bill have often put it:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Why would all this finely filigreed structure with sharp demarcation between hard and easy cases exist if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%5Cneq+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}" class="latex" /> were a false illusion? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
At the very least, this puts the onus on a believer in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" /> to give an alternative explanation of how such structure could arise. </p>
<p>
It strikes us, however, that this also puts a squeeze on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BBQP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{BQP}}" class="latex" /> under the conventional wisdom that it is intermediate between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{\#P}}" class="latex" />, without being <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" />-hard in particular. This is not in technical conflict with the Cai-Chen dichotomy because exactly computing the acceptance probabilities of a class of quantum circuits (on inputs built into the circuits) can be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{\#P}}" class="latex" />-complete while the circuits use only a gap in probabilities to solve problems that are easy or intermediate. But we suspect that this still limits possible ways to capture <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BBQP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{BQP}}" class="latex" /> “naturally” by descriptive logic.</p>
<p>
The prize paper with Chen is just one part of a long-term project by Jin-Yi and co-workers on classifying counting problems and showing where dichotomy applies. A 2010 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0803">paper</a> of Jin-Yi with Lu and Sangxia Huang bridged from #CSP and a subcase of counting homomorphisms between graphs to a wider kind of sum-over-products formula originally called a <b>holant</b> <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jyc/papers/LAA-journalversion.pdf">here</a>. Recent progress on dichotomy for holants is represented by this FOCS 2020 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07906">paper</a> with Shuai Shao. This is also both directly relevant to quantum computation and maps out progress that is still out there to make. The paper has a one-page prologue that summons characters from legendary fantasy (and <em>Star Wars</em>) to conquer quantum issues.</p>

<div class="content">
Recently, Forbes, Kumar and Saptharishi [CCC, 2016] proved that there exists an explicit $d^{O(1)}$-variate and degree $d$ polynomial $P_{d} \in VNP$ such that if any depth four circuit $C$ of bounded formal degree $d$ which computes a polynomial of bounded individual degree $O(1)$, that is functionally equivalent to $P_d$, then $C$ must have size $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{d}\log{d})}$.

The motivation for their work comes from Boolean Circuit Complexity. Based on a characterization for $ACC^0$ circuits by Yao [FOCS, 1985] and Beigel and Tarui [CC, 1994], Forbes, Kumar and Saptharishi [CCC, 2016] observed that functions in $ACC^0$ can also be computed by algebraic $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuits (i.e., circuits of the form -- sums of powers of polynomials) of $2^{\log^{O(1)}n}$ size. Thus they argued that a $2^{\omega(\log^{O(1)}{n})}$ "functional" lower bound for an explicit polynomial $Q$ against $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuits would imply a lower bound for the "corresponding Boolean function" of $Q$ against non-uniform $ACC^0$. In their work, they ask if their lower bound be extended to $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuits.

In this paper, for large integers $n$ and $d$ such that $\Omega(\log^2{n})\leq d\leq n^{0.01}$, we show that any $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuit of bounded individual degree at most $O(\frac{d}{k^2})$ that functionally computes Iterated Matrix Multiplication polynomial $IMM_{n,d}$ ($\in VP$) over $\{0,1\}^{n^2d}$ must have size $n^{\Omega(k)}$. Since Iterated Matrix Multiplication $IMM_{n,d}$ over $\{0,1\}^{n^2d}$ is functionally in $GapL$, improvement of the afore mentioned lower bound to hold for quasipolynomially large values of individual degree would imply a fine-grained separation of $ACC^0$ from $GapL$.

For the sake of completeness, we also show a syntactic size lower bound against any $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuit computing $IMM_{n,d}$ (for the same regime of $d$) which is tight over large fields. Like Forbes, Kumar and Saptharishi [CCC, 2016], we too prove lower bounds against circuits of bounded formal degree which functionally compute $IMM_{n,d}$, for a slightly larger range of individual degree.</div>

<p>Alright everyone:</p>



<ol><li>Victor Galitski has an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/quantum-computing-hype-bad-science-victor-galitski-1c?trk=public_post-content_share-article_title">impassioned rant against out-of-control quantum computing hype</a>, which I enjoyed and enthusiastically recommend, although I wished Galitski had engaged a bit more with the strongest arguments for optimism (e.g., the recent sampling-based supremacy experiments, the extrapolations that show gate fidelities crossing the fault-tolerance threshold within the next decade).  Even if I’ve been saying similar things on this blog for 15 years, I clearly haven’t been doing so in a style that works for everyone.  Quantum information needs as many people as possible who will tell the truth as best they see it, unencumbered by any competing interests, and has nothing legitimate to fear from that.  The modern intersection of quantum theory and computer science has raised profound scientific questions that will be with us for decades to come.  It’s a lily that need not be gilded with hype.<br /></li><li>Last month Limaye, Srinivasan, and Tavenas posted <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/081/">an exciting preprint to ECCC</a>, which apparently proves the first (slightly) superpolynomial lower bound on the size of constant-depth arithmetic circuits, over fields of characteristic 0.  Assuming it’s correct, this is another small victory in the generations-long war against the P vs. NP problem.<br /></li><li>I’m grateful to the Texas Democratic legislators who fled the state to prevent the legislature, a couple miles from my house, having a quorum to enact new voting restrictions, and who thereby drew national attention to the enormity of what’s at stake.  It should go without saying that, if a minority gets to rule indefinitely by forcing through laws to suppress the votes of a majority that would otherwise unseat it, thereby giving itself the power to force through more such laws, etc., then we no longer live in a democracy but in a banana republic.  And there’s no symmetry to the situation: no matter how terrified you (or I) might feel about wokeists and their denunciation campaigns, the Democrats have no comparable effort to suppress Republican votes.  Alas, I don’t know of any solutions beyond the obvious one, of trying to deal the conspiracy-addled grievance party crushing defeats in 2022 and 2024.<br /></li><li><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Added:</span></strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEYUt1tJlck">Here’s the video</a> of my recent Astral Codex Ten ask-me-anything session.</li></ol>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />Throughout the last few decades, we have witnessed unprecedented growth of machine learning. Originally a topic formalized by a small group of computer scientists, machine learning now impacts many areas: the physical sciences, medicine, commerce, finance, urban planning, and more. The rapid growth of machine learning can be partially attributed to the availability of large amounts of data and the development of powerful computing devices. Another important factor is that machine learning has foundations in many other fields, such as theoretical computer science, algorithms, applied mathematics, statistics, and optimization. </p>



<p>If machine learning is already mathematically rooted in many existing research areas, why do we need a field solely dedicated to learning theory? According to <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~djhsu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daniel Hsu</a>, “Learning theory serves (at least) two purposes: to help make sense of machine learning, and also to explore the capabilities and limitations of learning algorithms.” Besides finding innovative applications for existing tools, learning theorists also provide answers to long-standing problems and ask new fundamental questions. </p>



<p>Modern learning theory goes beyond classical statistical and computer science paradigms by: </p>



<ul><li>developing insights about specific computational models (e.g., neural networks) </li><li>analyzing popular learning algorithms (e.g., stochastic gradient descent)</li><li>taking into account data distributions (e.g., margin bounds or manifold assumptions)</li><li>adding auxiliary goals (e.g., robustness or privacy), and </li><li>rethinking how algorithms interact with and access data (e.g., online or reinforcement learning).</li></ul>



<p>By digging deep into the basic questions, researchers generate new concepts and models that change the way we solve problems and help us understand emerging phenomena.</p>



<p>This article provides a brief overview of three key areas in machine learning theory: new learning paradigms, trustworthy machine learning, and reinforcement learning. We describe the main thrust of each of these areas, as well as point to a few papers from <a href="http://algorithmiclearningtheory.org/alt2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ALT 2021</a> (the 32nd International Conference on Algorithmic Learning Theory) that touch each of these topics. To share a broader view, we also asked experts in the areas to comment on the field and on their recent papers. Needless to say, this article only scratches the surface. At the end, we point to places to learn more about learning theory.</p>



<span id="more-304"></span>



<p><strong>New Machine Learning Paradigms</strong><br />The traditional learning theory framework, probably approximately correct (PAC) learning, defines what it means to learn a ground-truth classifier from a candidate class of possible classifiers. Alongside PAC learning is Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theory, which characterizes the number of samples needed and sufficient to learn a classifier from a given class. The generalization analysis from VC theory is restricted to guarantees that hold independently of the data distribution — that is, even for worst-case distributions. Additionally, the VC/PAC learning paradigm suggests that whenever learning is possible, it can be accomplished by choosing the classifier that minimizes loss on the training data, called the empirical risk minimizer (ERM). </p>



<p>This classical framework unfortunately fails to explain the empirical success of machine learning (ML). “The distribution-free setting, while it comes with the elegant VC theory, turned out to be unsatisfactory,” says Csaba Szepesvári. “Due to the oversimplified setting, the theory could not contribute meaningfully to understanding all kinds of learning methods such as learning with trees, boosting, neural networks, SVMs, or using any other nonparametric methods.” Researchers posit that stronger guarantees should be possible if we leverage natural assumptions about the data distribution, though identifying the right “natural assumptions” is a challenging task. Similarly, understanding which of many possible ERM solutions a learning algorithm chooses may yield better generalization results than those yielded by VC theory. </p>



<p>Methods that provide <em>distribution-specific </em>guarantees aren’t new to learning theory. A canonical example is known as a margin bound, where the test error of a classifier is analyzed in terms of the margin that separates the different prediction categories. In <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/hanneke21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one</a> of the ALT best papers, Steve Hanneke and Aryeh Kontorovich prove generalization guarantees in terms of the size of the margin for two popular classification algorithms: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support vector machines</a> (SVMs) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perceptron</a> algorithm. The authors answer a core open question, showing that SVMs achieve the optimal margin bound!</p>



<p>Further work at ALT uses an assumption that data lies on a low-dimensional manifold to prove guarantees for generative models. Generative models synthesize <em>original</em> samples, such as images or text, that resemble training data, but without copying the data directly. While so-called <em>generative adversarial networks</em> work well in practice, few guarantees exist because it is challenging to statistically formulate the requirement of generating original samples. Nicolas Schreuder, Victor-Emmanuel Brunel, and Arnak S. Dalalyan consider a new framework in their <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/schreuder21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>, in which they guarantee originality by outputting a continuous distribution, which ensures that it is very unlikely to output training examples. If the training data is generated from a low-dimensional manifold, they show that it is possible to learn a good generator, which outputs a smooth transformation of a random point.</p>



<p>In another <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/tosh21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>, Christopher Tosh, Akshay Krishnamurthy, and Daniel Hsu use distributional assumptions to show when unsupervised methods can use unlabeled data to learn useful <em>representations </em>of data. A linear function trained on these representations and some labeled data can then be used for downstream prediction of the labels. The key idea is to look at when data has <em>multiview redundancy (MVR), </em>which arises, for instance, when data is augmented: Under MVR, each data point can be viewed as a pair (<em>X,</em> <em>Z</em>), and the label <em>Y</em> can be predicted almost as well from <em>X</em> or <em>Z</em> as from the full pair. For instance, each pair might be two halves of an article, or two rotations of an image. The authors show how a theoretical approach called <em>landmark embedding </em>can produce a representation that enables low-error linear classification. Additionally, they analyze when the representations are learned implicitly while training a model to predict whether two views <em>X</em> and <em>Z</em> correspond to the same example, which is close to what is done in practice. </p>



<p>Another new paradigm considers how the specific<em> training algorithm</em> affects which of many candidate ERM solutions are chosen. This is called the <em>implicit bias </em>of a training algorithm: If there are multiple equally good solutions, then why does an algorithm choose one over the other? This is particularly relevant when studying neural networks, which are typically<em> overparameterized</em> and can be trained to find many solutions with zero empirical risk. In one <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/ji21a/ji21a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>, Ziwei Ji and Matus Telgarsky characterize the implicit bias of using gradient descent to train a linear classifier with a general loss function. They show that the solution relates to the optimizer of a particular smoothed margin function. While this paper does not yield generalization guarantees, this type of implicit bias analysis can sometimes lead to generalization guarantees via margin bounds.</p>



<p>The goal of this area is to go beyond traditional learning theory paradigms by leveraging distributional and algorithmic properties. But a major open question is designing a more general mathematical theory that exploits such properties. <a href="http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~shaymrn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shay Moran</a> offers a standard for new theory: “I hope that in the next 10 years we will develop more realistic models of learning, but I will insist that they still be mathematically clean.”</p>



<p><strong>Trustworthy ML</strong><br />Machine learning has inspired many new areas and technologies: personalized health care, drug discovery, advertising, résumé screening, credit loans, and more. However, these critical and user-centered applications require a higher standard of testing and verification because mistakes may deeply affect many people. Addressing these challenges has inspired a new field of research centered on making machine learning more trustworthy and reliable, which is the motivation for many of the ALT papers this year as well. An expert in the area, <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~kamalika/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kamalika Chaudhuri</a>, says, “For my field, which is trustworthy ML, the theoretical goal and challenge remains modeling and frameworks.” She elaborates: “Coming up with new conceptual frameworks for learning has always been one of the core challenges in learning theory since its early days, and it is doubly important now.” Researchers have been exploring this direction in many areas, including privacy, data deletion, robustness, fairness, interpretability, and causality. </p>



<p>Several ALT 2021 papers cover questions in privacy. The general goal is to understand how to modify existing learning methods to take into account privacy constraints. One of the <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/wang21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">papers</a>, by Di Wang, Huanyu Zhang, Marco Gaboardi, and Jinhui Xu, considers generalized linear models in a differential privacy model. A central motivation is to understand the role of public, unlabeled data in improving the learnability of these problems in a private setting. Summarizing another direction, <a href="http://www.gautamkamath.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gautam Kamath</a> comments on his <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/aden-ali21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a> with co-authors Ishaq Aden-Ali and Hassan Ashtiani, “This paper focuses on a very simple but surprisingly challenging question: Can we learn a general multivariate Gaussian under the constraint of differential privacy? Prior works focused on restricted settings — for example, with bounded parameters or known covariance. We gave the first finite sample complexity bound for this problem, which evidence suggests is near optimal. The next question is to design a computationally efficient algorithm for this problem.” Another <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/cesar21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a> on privacy, by Mark Cesar and Ryan Rogers, studies the <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">composition</a> of various privacy mechanisms in the context of real-world data analytics pipelines.</p>



<p>Another aspect of respecting user privacy is allowing people to choose to stop sharing their data. Concretely, this means removing their data from data sets and ensuring that existing and future models do not make use of their data in any way. One name for this process is <em>machine unlearning</em>, and the main challenge is removing the data efficiently without retraining all models from scratch. One <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/neel21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>, by Seth Neel, Aaron Roth, and Saeed Sharifi-Malvajerdi, addresses this challenge. They propose ways to strategically update the model by using modified gradient descent methods. They also analyze this approach, and prove new upper and lower bounds for updating models after data deletion with their new optimization algorithm. </p>



<p>Robust methods for machine learning and statistics aim to provide rigorous guarantees in the presence of outliers or adversarially modified data points. The field of robustness has been steadily growing as researchers uncover more and more models where deviations in the data can lead to unexpected and dramatic changes in model behavior. In ALT 2021, a <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/shen21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a> by Jie Shen and Chicheng Zhang covers learning half-spaces nearly optimally even in the presence of malicious noise.</p>



<p>As a final and thought-provoking direction in trustworthy ML, <a href="https://omereingold.wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Omer Reingold</a> points out that we need to better understand “the meaning of individual probabilities/risk scores,” which are common ways that ML systems summarize or justify decisions. Ideally, the output of a model should be something that people can interpret directly and use to potentially modify their future actions. He elaborates that it is important to think about “the individual quantities (which imply important decisions) that ML is trying to approximate” and to answer “what does fitting the parameters of a model on the entire population imply for individuals and subcommunities?” This question brings to the forefront the fact that ML systems affect both individuals and groups of people, which is an important consideration when formulating rigorous definitions of fairness (e.g., see <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-ethical-algorithm-9780190948207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this book</a> or <a href="https://fairmlbook.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this one</a>).</p>



<p><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong><br />Reinforcement learning (RL) is a framework for interactive learning where an agent interacts with an environment, and the agent’s actions govern the rewards it receives from the environment. Part of the motivation for studying RL is that relevant problems are everywhere. Sometimes the agents are autonomous vehicles. Other times, they are programs playing games like chess or go. People interact more and more with ML models, and hence, living our lives is actually being a part of a multiagent game where we, humans, and the ML models are the agents. “The most exciting direction in learning theory of recent years,” says <a href="https://www.ehazan.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elad Hazan</a>, “is adding rigorous theoretical guarantees to reinforcement learning.” </p>



<p>The RL environment is typically modeled as a <em>Markov decision process (MDP)</em>: a set of states, actions, and transition probabilities that determine the next state and reward given the agent’s current state and action. The agent uses a <em>policy</em> to choose its action from each state with the goal of maximizing its cumulative reward over time. A central challenge is balancing<em> exploration</em> (learning about the environment) and <em>exploitation</em> (spending time choosing actions in states where they can collect high rewards).</p>



<p>In the most basic setting, <em>multi-armed bandits</em>, there is a single state, and each action (or “arm”) leads to a stochastic reward. “Here, the theory is quite mature, though interesting problems remain in connection to the limits of how structure can be exploited,” <a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Csaba Szepesvári</a> says. In two works at ALT, by <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/jourdan21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marc Jourdan, Mojmír Mutný, Johannes Kirschner, and Andreas Krause</a> and by <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/cuvelier21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thibaut Cuvelier, Richard Combes, and Eric Gourdin</a>, the authors show that efficient exploration is possible in a <em>combinatorial semi-bandit </em>setting. Here, the agent can choose an allowed <em>set</em> of arms in each step, and it receives a distinct reward for each chosen arm. While the number of action choices for the agent is larger, this more detailed feedback makes the problem tractable.</p>



<p>Beyond the stateless bandit setting, ML theorists are still figuring out how fast agents can learn how to play optimally in MDPs with <em>finite</em> state spaces and action spaces. Recent progress on this front has given lower bounds on the sample complexity required for agents to learn the best policy. In one ALT <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/domingues21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>, the authors give a unified view of lower bounds for three distinct, but related, problems in RL. The hard MDP instances they construct to show lower bounds are based on hard instances for multi-armed bandit problems.</p>



<p>In the more challenging setting where the state space is infinite, a central question is whether the agent can learn from exploring a finite number of states, and generalize<em> </em>to perform well on unknown areas of the environment. For certain MDPs, generalizing is impossible, but some assumptions on the structure of the MDP may enable generalization. “While algorithm independent problem formulations existed and have been studied in the finite case, a quite recent development is to extend these to the case of ‘large’ environments where the use of <em>function approximation </em>techniques becomes crucial for achieving nontrivial results,” explains Csaba Szepesvári. </p>



<p>Function approximation has to do with the optimal <em>action-value function, </em>which captures the long-term reward of playing a certain action from a given state. This function can sometimes be approximated by some simple class of functions. One of the strongest such assumptions is <em>linear realizability, </em>where the optimal action-value function<em> </em>is a linear function of some representation of the action and state. In one of the <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/weisz21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">papers</a> receiving a best paper award in ALT, Gellert Weisz, Philip Amortila, and Csaba Szepesvári show that even under this strong assumption of linear realizability, the agent needs a number of samples exponential in the length of the episode or the dimension of the representation in order to generalize. Looking forward, the goal is to follow the lead of these papers and better understand the landscape of sample complexity: When can we learn models with a polynomial number of samples, and when is an exponential number necessary?</p>



<p>Nearly every offline learning problem can be studied in an interactive setting, where inputs arrive in an online fashion and need to be processed immediately, which is common in many real-world settings. Models for interactive machine learning provide a framework for studying problems and algorithms in this more challenging setting. Beyond the MDP setting, interactive learning spans online learning (e.g., <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/moshkovitz21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no-substitution</a> <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/bhattacharjee21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clustering</a>), nonstochastic control theory (e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12178" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">robust controllers for dynamical systems</a>), <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online convex optimization</a>, and many more domains. </p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />We hope this provides a fairly broad view on some of the topics that people are researching right now in learning theory. Of course, there are many more areas that we don’t have space to describe: theory of deep neural networks, quantum algorithms for machine learning problems, human-centered considerations, learning with strategic agents and multiplayer games, convex/nonconvex optimization, federated and distributed learning algorithms, and many more. In general, as Gautam Kamath observes, “A lot of important questions in learning theory arise through interplay between the theoretical and applied machine learning communities.” To have a greater impact, it is important to collaborate with people doing empirical research, and to learn from the front lines about the most interesting phenomena to explain, or the challenges that do not seem surmountable by combining existing tools.</p>



<p>To learn more and to get more involved, we have listed a variety of resources (blogs, workshops, videos, etc.) that can help you get started in this area. As a final motivation for writing this article, we remark that people in the area are keenly aware that we need more young talent to help uncover truth and contribute groundbreaking ideas. As Gautam Kamath puts it, “There are far more interesting questions in learning theory than there are researchers to solve them.”</p>

<div class="content">
Over finite fields $F_q$ containing a root of unity of smooth order $n$ (smoothness means $n$ is the product of small primes), the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) leads to the fastest known algebraic algorithms for many basic polynomial operations, such as multiplication, division, interpolation and multi-point evaluation. These operations can be computed by constant fan-in arithmetic circuits over $F_q$ of quasi-linear size; specifically, $O(n \log n)$ for multiplication and division, and $O(n \log^2 n)$ for interpolation and evaluation.

However, the same operations over fields with no smooth order root of unity suffer from an asymptotic slowdown, typically due to the need to introduce “synthetic” roots of unity to enable the FFT. The classical algorithm of Schönhage and Strassen incurred a multiplicative slowdown factor of $\log \log n$ on top of the smooth case. Recent remarkable results of Harvey, van der Hoeven and Lecerf dramatically reduced this multiplicative overhead to $\exp(\log^* (n))$.

We introduce a new approach to fast algorithms for polynomial operations over all large finite fields. The key idea is to replace the group of roots of unity with a set of points $L \subset F_q$ suitably related to a well-chosen elliptic curve group over $F_q$ (the set L itself is not a group). The key advantage of this approach is that elliptic curve groups can be of any size in the Hasse–Weil interval $[q + 1 \pm 2\sqrt{q}]$ and thus can have subgroups of large, smooth order, which an FFT-like divide and conquer algorithm can exploit. Compare this with multiplicative subgroups over $F_q$ whose order must divide $q-1$. By analogy, our method extends the standard, multiplicative FFT in a similar way to how Lenstra’s elliptic curve method extended Pollard’s $p-1$ algorithm for factoring integers.

For polynomials represented by their evaluation over subsets of $L$, we show that  multiplication, division, degree-computation, interpolation, evaluation and Reed–Solomon encoding (also known as low-degree extension) with fixed evaluation points can all be computed with arithmetic circuits of size similar to what is achievable with the classical FFTs when the field size $q$ is special. For several problems, this yields the asymptotically smallest known arithmetic circuits even in the standard monomial representation of polynomials.

The efficiency of the classical FFT follows from using the 2-to-1 squaring map to reduce the evaluation set of roots of unity of order $2^k$ to similar groups of size $2^{k?i}$, $i &gt; 0$. Our algorithms operate similarly, using isogenies of elliptic curves with kernel size 2 as 2-to-1 maps to reduce $L$ of size $2^k$ to sets of size $2^{k?i}$ that are, like $L$, suitably related to elliptic curves, albeit different ones.</div>

<p>There are two reasons for the large number of Good Articles in this set. First, I had previously been trying to keep my nominations and reviews in balance, but there were too few nominations to review on topics of interest to me, and the inability to find things to review was preventing me from nominating other articles when they were ready. So I started nominating more often. And second, the Wikipedia Good Articles editors are having a drive this month to clean out old nominations, as they tend to do a couple of times per year.</p>

José Altuve hit a game-winning home run in the bottom of the ninth against the Yankees on Sunday. He thereby reproduced the conditions and the outcome of baseball’s most dramatic cheating accusation of 2019.</p>
<p>
Today, at baseball’s All-Star break, we review this and other social experiments that have quite a bit more data.<br />
<span id="more-18952"></span></p>
<p>
Altuve won the 2019 American League Championship series with a pinch-hit homer in the bottom of the ninth against the Yankees’ closer, Aroldis Chapman. As he approached home plate, he was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTNBnk1dz6g">seen</a> telling his teammates waiting to mob him at the plate not to rip off his jersey in celebration. He subsequently <a href="https://youtu.be/-ryvOya4PoE?t=247">scooted</a> into the corridor behind the dugout, then re-emerged into the on-field celebration. This fed accusations that he had been wired with a buzzer to know what kind of pitch was coming from Chapman, in line with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros_sign_stealing_scandal">sign-stealing</a> by other means from the Astros’ 2017 championship season and 2018 that was proven and punished by Major League Baseball. </p>
<p>
Almost the same scenario was reproduced Sunday: Houston down 7-5 against the Yankees with two out and two on base in the ninth, Altuve up against the Yankees’ closer (Chad Green recently supplanting Chapman). Altuve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHrc6OdYOpo">socked</a> a homer to the same part of the ballpark to complete a shocking six-run comeback. Immediately upon touching home, he had his shirt ripped off to reveal nothing but the top half of his birthday suit. This was the most direct way possible to witness that he could have hit the other homer without illegal information.</p>

I have dealt with chess-cheating cases in which electronic buzzing has been specifically alleged, including the two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borislav_Ivanov#Retirement_from_competitive_chess_and_brief_return_to_chess-related_activities">most</a> prominent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/crosswords/chess/a-master-is-disqualified-over-suspicions-of-cheating.html">cases</a> of 2013.

<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> What is considered a “social proof” of an assertion—especially when there are elements of scientific control and reproduction? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
A simple example is a police lineup. This tries to control for whether a witness has previously seen the accused by including the accused among usually four or five similarly represented people. Picking the right person is considered to prove the previous encounter. Statistically, however, this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{p}" class="latex" />-value</a> of only 0.20 or 0.167, which are not considered significant at even the weakest level of “statistical proof.” Allowing <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug04/lineups">null</a> lineups does not change the statistics much.</p>
<p>
Baseball gives a non-example that surprises me. One of the bad performances that cost Chapman his closer role was losing an 8-4 lead against the Los Angeles Angels on June 30. As a fantasy-baseball player, I’ve regularly observed poor pitching (by the closers on my “fantasy team”) when the lead is too large to earn credit for a coveted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)">save</a>. Does the data reproduce a phenomenon of closers bearing down less when way ahead, with no “save” to gain? A <a href="https://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2014/1/27/5344580/the-closer-mentality-part-1-closers-in-non-save-situations">study</a> after the 2013 season, which cleverly represented performances by the same <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{z}" class="latex" />-scores I use in chess, found none. “Meltdowns” like Chapman’s are offset by cases where closers pitched better. The <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{z}" class="latex" />-scores in the study are all in the range -1.25 to +1.50 anyway, which count as statistically random.</p>
<p>
This study used a reasonably large data set, one that is well-defined and admits controlling factors such as normalizing for game circumstances and the quality of the opposing hitters. At least it is more than the two instances of Altuve. In-between would be an attempt to determine whether certain national soccer teams are consistently worse at penalty-kick tiebreaks. England’s and Italy’s teams brought their long tortured histories together in the tiebreak of Sunday’s European Cup final. The Italians missed two of five kicks, a score that often spells doom, but the English missed three.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Larger Scale </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Dick and I are really interested in “experiments” that have spilled into society, with minimal controls but large data. One sphere of this is cybersecurity. </p>
<p>
It seems to us that only in the past decade have security experts begun formalizing their research as experimental science with repeatability and reproducibility as explicit criteria. The NSA devoted a special 2012 <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/70/documents/resources/everyone/digital-media-center/publications/the-next-wave/TNW-19-2.pdf">issue</a> of their <em>Next Wave</em> series to what they titled as “Developing a blueprint for a science of cybersecurity.” Among the contents are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
An introductory essay by Carl Landwehr titled, “Cybersecurity: From engineering to science.” <p></p>
</li><li>
A linchpin <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~ccpalmer/teaching/cs55/Resources/Papers/TNW_19_2_BlueprintScienceCybersecurity_Schneider.pdf">paper</a> by Fred Schneider titled, “Blueprint for a science of cybersecurity.” <p></p>
</li><li>
A <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maxion/pubs/Maxion12.pdf">paper</a> by Roy Maxion titled, “Making experiments dependable,” which came from a 2011 Springer LNCS <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-24541-1">Festschrift</a>.
</li></ul>
<p>
Maxion’s main example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_dynamics">keystroke biometrics</a>. This covers inferences made from typing style on a computer keyboard or mouse or similar handheld input device. This can be used to verify identity or screen for malfeasant activities. Online chess playing platforms collect data of this nature—okay we could not resist adding chess example. </p>
<p>
Another area is experiments designed to simulate attacks and test defenses against them. Schneider’s paper begins with a contrast between <em>predictive</em> modeling versus <em>reactive</em> handling of them. About the latter, he draws an analogy with health care:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Some health problems are best handled in a reactive manner. We know what to do when somebody breaks a finger, and each year we create a new influenza vaccine in anticipation of the flu season to come. But only after making significant investments in basic medical sciences are we starting to understand the mechanisms by which cancers grow, and a cure seems to require that kind of deep understanding.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
He goes on to outline the kind of scientific foundation that could hopefully underlie a ‘cure’ for intrusion and malware and the like. </p>
<p>
What we have seen happen especially in the past months, however—in both health and security—is uncontrolled experiments with society as the domain. Large-scale ransomware attacks are becoming as frequent as hurricanes and heat waves. And of course, the pandemic. These share with Altuve the property of being one-off instances, but have large data on the receiving end.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Summer Pandemic Update </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The following chart updates our June 20 <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/06/20/the-shape-of-this-summer/">post</a> on the state of the pandemic and its projection for the summer—for Florida and the United Kingdom in particular:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/07/13/socially-reproduced-experiments/flukcases071321/" rel="attachment wp-att-18955"><img width="450" alt="" src="https://i2.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/FLUKCases071321.png?resize=450%2C440&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-18955" height="440" /></a></p>
<p>
The vertical line shows about where the charts were on June 20. The past few days are the first where we can point to a significant rise in Florida, though Missouri had a similar rise last week and it is showing up in some other states.  The charts are taken from the <em>Worldometer</em> coronavirus <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">pages</a>. </p>
<p>
The UK rise looks ghastly. It was a subtext of our previous post to worry that allowing the large dense soccer crowds at London’s Wembley Stadium for the semis and final—and anything similar in baseball—would stoke the rise in our respective countries even more. However, the rate of hospitalizations in the UK has remained largely flat. This Fortune <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/07/08/kids-vulnerable-covid-delta-variant-vaccinated-europe/">article</a> last week is one of several attesting that the new cases are mostly in children or in vaccinated people with enough immunity to contain the “breakthrough” positive. The UK is going ahead with large-scale re-openings later this month, with the portion of those 18 and older who have had one dose approaching 90% and those fully vaccinated coming past 70%. The latter number in relation to the whole population is about 52%.</p>
<p>
The US looks like becoming an experiment in how the local vaccination rate affects the numbers. The rates of those fully vaccinated by state are currently eerily <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/08/politics/electoral-map-vaccine-map-covid-19/index.html">similar</a> to Joe Biden’s vote percentage in the state. One aspect of scientific reproducibility is the size of the simplest classifier of the results. For a presidential vote to have simpler explaining power than any factors of biology or other life circumstances would make a strange experiment indeed.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Dick and I tried to come up with other examples—from computer security in particular—to sustain what has been occupying our thoughts about standards of proof for policy. We would welcome some examples from you, our readers. </p>
<p>
And of course, we have been concerned about the present course of the pandemic amid re-openings since the referenced post last month. In the meantime, if it is your taste, please enjoy the All-Star Game, which Altuve is, ironically, <a href="https://calltothepen.com/2021/07/11/houston-astros-officially-skipping-star-game/">skipping</a>.</p>

We give tight bounds on the degree $\ell$  homogenous parts $f_\ell$ of a bounded function $f$ on the cube. We show that if $f: \{\pm 1\}^n \rightarrow [-1,1]$ has degree $d$, then $\| f_\ell \|_\infty$ is bounded by $d^\ell/\ell!$, and $\| \hat{f}_\ell \|_1$ is bounded by $d^\ell e^{{\ell+1 \choose 2}} n^{\frac{\ell-1}{2}}$. We describe applications to pseudorandomness and learning theory. We use similar methods to generalize the classical Pisier's inequality from convex analysis. Our analysis  involves properties of real-rooted polynomials that may be useful elsewhere.</div>

<div class="content">
<p>A basic and frequent task in data analysis is <em>selection</em> – given a set of options \(\mathcal{Y}\), output the (approximately) best one, where “best” is defined by some loss function \(\ell : \mathcal{Y} \times \mathcal{X}^n \to \mathbb{R}\) and a dataset \(x \in \mathcal{X}^n\). That is, we want to output some \(y \in \mathcal{Y}\) that approximately minimizes \(\ell(y,x)\). Naturally, we are interested in <em>private selection</em> – i.e., the output should be differentially private in terms of the dataset \(x\).
This post discusses algorithms for private selection – in particular, we give an improved privacy analysis of the popular exponential mechanism.</p>

<h2 id="the-exponential-mechanism">The Exponential Mechanism</h2>

<p>The most well-known algorithm for private selection is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_mechanism_(differential_privacy)"><em>exponential mechanism</em></a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCS.2007.66" title="Frank McSherry, Kunal Talwar. Mechanism Design via Differential Privacy. FOCS 2007."><strong>[MT07]</strong></a>. The exponential mechanism \(M : \mathcal{X}^n \to \mathcal{Y} \) is a randomized algorithm given by \[\forall x \in \mathcal{X}^n ~ \forall y \in \mathcal{Y} ~~~~~ \mathbb{P}[M(x) = y] = \frac{\exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta} \ell(y,x))}{\sum_{y’ \in \mathcal{Y}} \exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta} \ell(y’,x)) }, \tag{1}\] where \(\Delta\) is the sensitivity of the loss function \(\ell\) given by \[\Delta = \sup_{x,x’ \in \mathcal{X}^n : d(x,x’) \le 1} \max_{y\in\mathcal{Y}} |\ell(y,x) - \ell(y,x’)|,\tag{2}\] where the supremum is taken over all datasets \(x\) and \(x’\) differing on the data of a single individual (which we denote by \(d(x,x’)\le 1\)).</p>

<p>In terms of utility, we can easily show that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02513" title="Raef Bassily, Kobbi Nissim, Adam Smith, Thomas Steinke, Uri Stemmer, Jonathan Ullman. Algorithmic Stability for Adaptive Data Analysis. STOC 2016."><strong>[BNSSSU16]</strong></a> \[\mathbb{E}[\ell(M(x),x)] \le \min_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} \ell(y,x) + \frac{2\Delta}{\varepsilon} \log |\mathcal{Y}|\] for all \(x \in \mathcal{X}^n\) (and we can also give high probability bounds).</p>

<p>It is easy to show that the exponential mechanism satisfies \(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy.
But there is more to this story! We’re going to look at a more refined privacy analysis.</p>

<h2 id="bounded-range">Bounded Range</h2>

<p>The privacy guarantee of the exponential mechanism is more precisely characterized by <em>bounded range</em>. This was observed and defined by David Durfee and Ryan Rogers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04273" title="David Durfee, Ryan Rogers. Practical Differentially Private Top-k Selection with Pay-what-you-get Composition. NeurIPS 2019"><strong>[DR19]</strong></a> and further analyzed later <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13830" title="Jinshuo Dong, David Durfee, Ryan Rogers. Optimal Differential Privacy Composition for Exponential Mechanisms. ICML 2020."><strong>[DDR20]</strong></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Definition 1 (Bounded Range).</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> 
A randomized algorithm \(M : \mathcal{X}^n \to \mathcal{Y}\) satisfies \(\eta\)-bounded range if, for all pairs of inputs \(x, x’ \in \mathcal{X}^n\) differing only on the data of a single individual, there exists some \(t \in \mathbb{R}\) such that \[\forall y \in \mathcal{Y} ~~~~~ \log\left(\frac{\mathbb{P}[M(x)=y]}{\mathbb{P}[M(x’)=y]}\right) \in [t, t+\eta].\] Here \(t\) may depend on the pair of input datasets \(x,x’\), but not on the output \(y\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To interpret this definition, we <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/flavoursofdelta/">recall the definition of the privacy loss random variable</a>: Define \(f : \mathcal{Y} \to \mathbb{R}\) by \[f(y) = \log\left(\frac{\mathbb{P}[M(x)=y]}{\mathbb{P}[M(x’)=y]}\right).\] Then the privacy loss random variable \(Z \gets \mathsf{PrivLoss}(M(x)\|M(x’))\) is given by \(Z = f(M(x))\).</p>

<p>Pure \(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy is equivalent to demanding that the privacy loss is bounded by \(\varepsilon\) – i.e., \(\mathbb{P}[|Z|\le\varepsilon]=1\). Approximate \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-differential privacy is, roughly, equivalent to demanding that \(\mathbb{P}[Z\le\varepsilon]\ge1-\delta\).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Now \(\eta\)-bounded range is simply demanding that the privacy loss \(Z\) is supported on some interval of length \(\eta\). This interval \([t,t+\eta]\) may depend on the pair \(x,x’\).</p>

<p>Bounded range and pure differential privacy are equivalent up to a factor of 2 in the parameters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Lemma 2 (Bounded Range versus Pure Differential Privacy).</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>\(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy implies \(\eta\)-bounded range with \(\eta \le 2\varepsilon\).</li>
    <li>\(\eta\)-bounded range implies \(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy with \(\varepsilon \le \eta\).</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Proof.</em> The first part of the equivalence follows from the fact that pure \(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy implies the privacy loss is supported on the interval \([-\varepsilon,\varepsilon]\). Thus, if we set \(t=-\varepsilon\) and \(\eta=2\varepsilon\), then \([t,t+\eta] = [-\varepsilon,\varepsilon]\).
The second part follows from the fact that the support of the privacy loss \([t,t+\eta]\) must straddle \(0\). That is, the privacy loss cannot be always positive nor always negative, so \(0 \in [t,t+\eta]\) and, hence, \([t,t+\eta] \subseteq [-\eta,\eta]\). Otherwise \(\forall y ~ f(y)&gt;0\) or \(\forall y ~ f(y)&lt;0\)  would imply \(\forall y ~ \mathbb{P}[M(x)=y]&gt;\mathbb{P}[M(x’)=y]\) or \(\forall y ~ \mathbb{P}[M(x)=y]&lt;\mathbb{P}[M(x’)=y]\), contradicting the fact that \(\sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} \mathbb{P}[M(x)=y] = 1\) and \(\sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} \mathbb{P}[M(x’)=y] = 1\). ∎</p>

<p>OK, back to the exponential mechanism:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Lemma 3 (The Exponential Mechanism is Bounded Range).</strong>
The exponential mechanism (given in Equation 1 above) satisfies \(\varepsilon\)-bounded range .<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Proof.</em>
We have \[e^{f(y)} = \frac{\mathbb{P}[M(x)=y]}{\mathbb{P}[M(x’)=y]} = \frac{\exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta}\ell(y,x))}{\exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta}\ell(y,x’))} \cdot \frac{\sum_{y’} \exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta} \ell(y’,x’))}{\sum_{y’} \exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta} \ell(y’,x))}.\]
Setting \(t = \log\left(\frac{\sum_{y’} \exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta} \ell(y’,x’))}{\sum_{y’} \exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta} \ell(y’,x))}\right) - \frac{\varepsilon}{2}\), we have \[ f(y) = \frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta} (\ell(y,x’)-\ell(y,x)+\Delta) + t.\]
By the definition of sensitivity (given in Equation 2), we have \( 0 \le \ell(y,x’)-\ell(y,x)+\Delta \le 2\Delta\), whence \(t \le f(y) \le t + \varepsilon\). ∎</p>

<p>Bounded range is not really a useful privacy definition on its own. Thus we’re going to relate it to a relaxed version of differential privacy next.</p>

<h2 id="concentrated-differential-privacy">Concentrated Differential Privacy</h2>

<p>Concentrated differential privacy <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02065" title="Mark Bun, Thomas Steinke. Concentrated Differential Privacy: Simplifications, Extensions, and Lower Bounds. TCC 2016."><strong>[BS16]</strong></a> and its variants <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01887" title="Cynthia Dwork, Guy N. Rothblum. Concentrated Differential Privacy. 2016."><strong>[DR16]</strong></a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07476" title="Ilya Mironov. Rényi Differential Privacy. CCS 2017."><strong>[M17]</strong></a> are relaxations of pure differential privacy with many nice properties. In particular, it composes very cleanly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Definition 4 (Concentrated Differential Privacy).</strong>
A randomized algorithm \(M : \mathcal{X}^n \to \mathcal{Y}\) satisfies \(\rho\)-concentrated differential privacy if, for all pairs of inputs \(x, x’ \in \mathcal{X}^n\) differing only on the data of a single individual, 
\[\forall \lambda &gt; 0 ~~~~~ \mathbb{E}[\exp( \lambda Z)] \le \exp(\lambda(\lambda+1)\rho),\tag{3}\]
where \(Z \gets \mathsf{PrivLoss}(M(x)\|M(x’))\) is the privacy loss random variable.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Intuitively, concentrated differential privacy requires that the privacy loss is subgaussian. Specifically, the bound on the moment generating function of \(\rho\)-concentrated differential privacy is tight if the privacy loss \(Z\) follows the distribution \(\mathcal{N}(\rho,2\rho)\). Indeed, the privacy loss random variable of the Gaussian mechanism has such a distribution.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>OK, back to the exponential mechanism:
We know that \(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy implies \(\frac12 \varepsilon^2\)-concentrated differential privacy <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02065" title="Mark Bun, Thomas Steinke. Concentrated Differential Privacy: Simplifications, Extensions, and Lower Bounds. TCC 2016."><strong>[BS16]</strong></a>.
This, of course, applies to the exponential mechaism. A cool fact – that we want to draw more attention to – is that we can do better! 
Specifically, \(\eta\)-bounded range implies \(\frac18 \eta^2\)-concentrated differential privacy <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07223" title="Mark Cesar, Ryan Rogers. Bounding, Concentrating, and Truncating: Unifying Privacy Loss Composition for Data Analytics. ALT 2021."><strong>[CR21]</strong></a>.
What follows is a proof of this fact following that of Mark Cesar and Ryan Rogers, but with some simplification.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 5 (Bounded Range implies Concentrated Differential Privacy).</strong>
If \(M\) is \(\eta\)-bounded range, then it is \(\frac18\eta^2\)-concentrated differentially private.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Proof.</em>
Fix datasets \(x,x’ \in \mathcal{X}^n\) differing on a single individual’s data.
Let \(Z \gets \mathsf{PrivLoss}(M(x)\|M(x’))\) be the privacy loss random variable of the mechanism \(M\) on this pair of datasets.
By the definition of bounded range (Definition 1), there exists some \(t \in \mathbb{R}\) such that \(Z \in [t, t+\eta]\) with probability 1.
Now we employ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoeffding%27s_lemma">Hoeffding’s Lemma</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080%2F01621459.1963.10500830" title="Wassily Hoeffding. Probability inequalities for sums of bounded random variables. JASA 1963."><strong>[H63]</strong></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Lemma 6 (Hoeffding’s Lemma).</strong>
Let \(X\) be a random variable supported on the interval \([a,b]\). Then, for all \(\lambda \in \mathbb{R}\), we have \[\mathbb{E}[\exp(\lambda X)] \le \exp \left( \mathbb{E}[X] \cdot \lambda + \frac{(b-a)^2}{8} \cdot \lambda^2 \right).\]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Applying the lemma to the privacy loss gives \[\forall \lambda \in \mathbb{R} ~~~~~  \mathbb{E}[\exp(\lambda Z)] \le \exp \left( \mathbb{E}[Z] \cdot \lambda + \frac{\eta^2}{8} \cdot \lambda^2 \right).\]
The only remaining thing we need is to show is that \(\mathbb{E}[Z] \le \frac18 \eta^2\).<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>If we set \(\lambda = -1 \), then we get \( \mathbb{E}[\exp( - Z)] \le \exp \left( -\mathbb{E}[Z] + \frac{\eta^2}{8} \right)\), which rearranges to \(\mathbb{E}[Z] \le \frac18 \eta^2 - \log \mathbb{E}[\exp( - Z)]\). 
Now we have \[ \mathbb{E}[\exp( - Z)] \!=\! \sum_y \mathbb{P}[M(x)\!=\!y] \exp(-f(y)) \!=\! \sum_y \mathbb{P}[M(x)\!=\!y]  \!\cdot\! \frac{\mathbb{P}[M(x’)\!=\!y]}{\mathbb{P}[M(x)\!=\!y]} \!=\! 1.\]
∎</p>

<p>This brings us to the TL;DR of this post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Corollary 7.</strong> The exponential mechanism (given by Equation 1) is \(\frac18 \varepsilon^2\)-concentrated differentially private.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is great news. The standard analysis only gives \(\frac12 \varepsilon^2\)-concentrated differential privacy. Constants matter when applying differential privacy, and we save a factor of 4 in the concentrated differential privacy analysis of the exponential mechanism for free with this improved analysis.</p>

<p>Combining Lemma 2 with Theorem 5 also gives a simpler proof of the conversion from pure differential privacy to concentrated differential privacy <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02065" title="Mark Bun, Thomas Steinke. Concentrated Differential Privacy: Simplifications, Extensions, and Lower Bounds. TCC 2016."><strong>[BS16]</strong></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Corollary 8.</strong> \(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy implies \(\frac12 \varepsilon^2\)-concentrated differential privacy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="beyond-the-exponential-mechanism">Beyond the Exponential Mechanism</h2>

<p>The exponential mechanism is not the only algorithm for private selection. A closely-related algorithm is <em>report noisy max/min</em>:<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> Draw independent noise \(\xi_y\) from some distribution for each \(y \in \mathcal{Y}\) then output \[M(x) = \underset{y \in \mathcal{Y}}{\mathrm{argmin}} ~ \ell(y,x) - \xi_y.\]</p>

<p>If the noise distribution is an appropriate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumbel_distribution">Gumbel distribution</a>, then report noisy max is exactly the exponential mechanism. (This equivalence is known as the “Gumbel max trick.”)</p>

<p>We can also use the Laplace distribution or the exponential distribution. Report noisy max with the exponential distribution is equivalent to the <em>permute and flip</em> algorithm <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12603" title="Ryan McKenna, Daniel Sheldon. Permute-and-Flip: A new mechanism for differentially private selection . NeurIPS 2020."><strong>[MS20]</strong></a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07260" title="Zeyu Ding, Daniel Kifer, Sayed M. Saghaian N. E., Thomas Steinke, Yuxin Wang, Yingtai Xiao, Danfeng Zhang. The Permute-and-Flip Mechanism is Identical to Report-Noisy-Max with Exponential Noise. 2021."><strong>[DKSSWXZ21]</strong></a>. However, these algorithms don’t enjoy the same improved bounded range and concentrated differential privacy guarantees as the exponential mechanism.</p>

<p>There are also other variants of the selection problem. For example, in some cases we can assume that only a few options have low loss and the rest of the options have high loss – i.e., there is a gap between the minimum loss and the second-lowest loss (or, more generally, the \(k\)-th lowest loss). In this case there are algorithms that attain better accuracy than the exponential mechanism under relaxed privacy definitions <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2177" title="Kamalika Chaudhuri, Daniel Hsu, Shuang Song. The Large Margin Mechanism for Differentially Private Maximization.

<p>There are a lot of interesting aspects of private selection, including questions for further research! We hope to have further posts about some of these topics.</p>

The concrete question of <i>would you pay $1000 to play</i> might be a paradox since most people would say NO even though the expected value is infinity.  See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox">here</a> for more background.</p><p>Shapley (see <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0022053177901429">here</a>) gives a good reason why you would not  pay $1000 to play the game, and also how much you should pay to play the game (spoiler alert: not much).

<div class="content">
<p>Piecewise-circular curves or, if you like, arc-polygons are a very old topic in mathematics. Archimedes and Pappus studied the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbelos">arbelos</a>, a curved triangle formed from three semicircles, and Hippocrates of Chios found that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lune_of_Hippocrates">lune of Hippocrates</a>, a two-sided figure bounded by a semicircle and a quarter-circle, has the same area as an isosceles right triangle stretched between the same two points. The history of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuleaux_triangle">Reuleaux triangle</a>, bounded by three sixths of circles, stretches back well past Reuleaux to the shapes of of Gothic church windows and its use by Leonardo da Vinci for fortress floor plans and world map projections. But despite their long history and frequent use (for instance in the design of machined parts), there are some basic properties of arc-polygons that seem to have been unexplored so far.</p>

<p>I looked at one of these properties, <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/05/09/arc-triangle-tilings.html">the ability of arc-triangles to tile the plane</a>, in an earlier post. Another of these properties involves the feasible combinations of angles of these shapes. As is well known, in a straight-sided triangle in the plane, the three interior angles always sum to exactly \(\pi\), and any three positive angles summing to \(\pi\) are possible. Let \(T\) be the set of triples of angles \((\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3)\) from triangles, and reinterpret these triples as coordinates of points in Euclidean space. Then \(T\) is itself an equilateral triangle, with corners at the three points \((\pi,0,0)\), \((0,\pi,0)\), and \((0,0\pi)\). (More precisely, it’s the relative interior of this triangle.)</p>

<p>What about arc-triangles? Are their angles similarly constrained? What shape do their triples of angles make? First of all, their angles don’t have a fixed sum (except for the tilers, for which this sum is again \(\pi\)). The arbelos has three interior angles that are all zero, summing to zero. The Reuleux triangle has three angles of \(2\pi/3\), summing to \(2\pi\). <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/05/15/linkage.html">Boscovitch’s cardioid</a>, below, uses three semicircles like the arbelos, but with one interior angle of \(2\pi\) and two others equal to \(\pi\), summing to \(4\pi\). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trefoil">trefoil</a>, a common architectural motif, bulges outward from its three corners, forming interior angles that are much larger, up to \(2\pi\) each for a trefoil made from three \(5/6\)-circle arcs, for a total interior angle of \(6\pi\).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/boscovich.svg" alt="Boscovich's cardioid" /></p>

<p>Nevertheless, for a non-self-crossing arc-triangle, not all combinations of angles are possible. For instance, it’s not possible to have one angle that is zero and two that are \(2\pi\). My new preprint, “Angles of arc-polygons and lombardi drawings of cacti” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03615">arXiv:2107.03615
</a>, with UCI students Daniel Frishberg and Martha Osegueda, to appear at CCCG) proves a precise characterization: beyond the obvious requirement that each angle \(\theta_i\) be in the range \(0\le\theta_i\le 2\pi\), we have only the additional inequalities</p>

\[-\pi &lt; \frac{\pi - \theta_i + \theta_{i+1} - \theta_{i+2}}{2} &lt; \pi\]

<p>where the index arithmetic is done modulo three. The formula in the middle of each of these inequalities is itself an angle, the angle of incidence between one of the circular arcs of the arc-triangle and the circle through its three corners. Where the straight triangles had an equilateral-triangle feasible region, the arc-triangles have a more complicated shape. The obvious constraints \(0\le\theta_i\le 2\pi\) would produce a cubical feasible region \([0,2\pi]^3\), but the additional inequalities above cut off six corners of the cube, leaving a feasible region looking like this:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/feasible-arc-triangles.svg" alt="The feasible region for triples of angles of arc-triangles" /></p>

<p>The motivating application for all of this is graph drawing, and more specifically Lombardi drawing, in which edges are circular arcs meeting at equal angles at each vertex. Using our new understanding of arc-polygons, we prove that every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cactus_graph">cactus graph</a> has a planar Lombardi drawing for its natural embedding (the one in which each cycle of the cactus forms a face) but might not for some other embeddings, including the one below.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/badhat.svg" alt="An embedded cactus that has no planar Lombardi drawing" /></p>

<p>But beyond graph drawing, I think that the long history and many applications of arc-polygons justifies more study of their general properties. For instance, what about arc-polygons with more than three sides? What can their angles be? Our paper has a partial answer, enough to answer the questions we asked in our Lombardi drawing application, but a complete characterization for arc-polygons of more than three sides is still open.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>My student Hadi Khodabandeh had a paper with me on spanners earlier this year at SoCG, in which we showed that <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/02/17/spanners-have-sparse.html">the greedy spanner algorithm for points in the Euclidean plane produces graphs with few crossings and small separators</a>. Now we have another spanner preprint: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15234">“Optimal spanners for unit ball graphs in doubling metrics”, arXiv:2106.15234</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubling_space">Doubling metrics</a> are a generalization of Euclidean spaces. Like Euclidean spaces, they have a dimension, the <em>doubling dimension</em>, but it might not be an integer. Even the doubling dimension of the Euclidean plane itself is \(\log_2 7\approx 2.807355\); this means that every circular disk of radius \(r\) in the plane can be covered by seven closed disks of radius \(r/2\).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/doubling-dim.svg" alt="Seven disks of radius $$r/2$$ cover a single disk of radius $$r$$" /></p>

<p>Analogously, the <em>doubling constant</em> of a metric space (if it exists) is the smallest number \(c\) such that every closed metric ball (the set of points within some radius \(r\) of a fixed point) can be covered by \(c\) balls of half the radius. The <em>doubling dimension</em> is the binary logarithm of the doubling constant. A metric space is a <em>doubling metric</em> or <em>doubling space</em> if it has a doubling constant and doubling dimension. This is true for all Euclidean spaces: for instance, if you cover a ball with a grid of hypercubes, sized small enough that their long diagonal has length at most the radius of the ball, you obtain doubling constant at most \(\lceil 2\sqrt{d}\rceil^d\), although it seems difficult to compute the precise doubling constant in general.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/grid-doubling.svg" alt="Nine disks of radius $$r/2$$ cover a square grid that covers a single disk of radius $$r$$" /></p>

<p>The hyperbolic plane provides a natural example of a space that is not a doubling space: arbitrarily large-radius disks require arbitrarily many half-radius disks to cover them.</p>

<p>Many results in computational geometry can be generalized to doubling metrics, but not always, and sometimes with difficulty. That includes results on spanners, as we consider in our paper. A spanner of a weighted graph is a subgraph whose shortest path distances approximate the distances in the full graph, and often for spanners of metric spaces one uses the complete graph, weighted by the metric distance between each pair of points. But here, we are using a different graph, the unit ball graph. The unit ball graph, for points in a continuous space, has an edge whenever two unit balls centered at two of the points have a nonempty intersection, and it can be extended to discrete point sets by instead including an edge whenever two points are at distance at most 2 (or, as in our paper, distance at most 1; scaling doesn’t really change anything). The weights are the same as in the complete graph. If a spanner accurately approximates all edge weights, it approximates all paths.</p>

<p>The unit ball graph has fewer edges to approximate than the complete graph. But that actually makes it harder to approximate, because by the same token there are fewer edges that can be used in the spanner. Despite that, the greedy spanner algorithm still produces a spanner, but one of its key properties is lost when going from Euclidean to doubling spaces: Euclidean greedy spanners have bounded degree, but greedy spanners in doubling spaces do not. Instead, our paper provides different spanner algorithms that apply to unit ball graphs, approximate paths in these graphs arbitrarily well, have bounded degree, have total weight a constant times that of the minimum spanning tree, and can be constructed efficiently in a distributed model of computing. I think the details are too technical to go into here, so see the paper for more.</p>

<p>In effort to understand implicit regularization in deep learning, a lot of theoretical focus is being directed at matrix factorization, which can be seen as linear neural networks.
This post is based on our <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09972.pdf">recent paper</a> (to appear at ICML 2021), where we take a step towards practical deep learning, by investigating <em>tensor factorization</em> — a model equivalent to a certain type of non-linear neural networks.
It is well known that <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.1393.pdf">most tensor problems are NP-hard</a>, and accordingly, the common sentiment is that working with tensors (in both theory and practice) entails extreme difficulties.
However, by adopting a dynamical systems view, we manage to avoid such difficulties, and establish an implicit regularization towards low <em>tensor rank</em>.
Our results suggest that tensor rank may shed light on generalization in deep learning.</p>

<h2 id="challenge-finding-a-right-measure-of-complexity">Challenge: finding a right measure of complexity</h2>

<p>Overparameterized neural networks are mysteriously able to generalize even when trained without any explicit regularization.
Per conventional wisdom, this generalization stems from an <em>implicit regularization</em> — a tendency of gradient-based optimization to fit training examples with predictors of minimal ‘‘complexity.’’
A major challenge in translating this intuition to provable guarantees is that we lack measures for predictor complexity that are quantitative (admit generalization bounds), and at the same time, capture the essence of natural data (images, audio, text etc.), in the sense that it can be fit with predictors of low complexity.</p>

<h2 id="a-common-testbed-matrix-factorization">A common testbed: matrix factorization</h2>

<p>Without a clear complexity measure for practical neural networks, existing analyses usually focus on simple settings where a notion of complexity is obvious. 
A common example of such a setting is <em>matrix factorization</em> — matrix completion via linear neural networks. 
This model was discussed pretty extensively in previous posts (see <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2019/06/03/trajectories/">one</a> by Sanjeev, <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2019/07/10/trajectories-linear-nets/">one</a> by Nadav and Wei and <a href="https://www.offconvex.org/2020/11/27/reg_dl_not_norm/">another one</a> by Nadav), but for completeness we present it again here.</p>

<p>In <em>matrix completion</em> we’re given a subset of entries from an unknown matrix $W^* \in \mathbb{R}^{d, d’}$, and our goal is to predict the unobserved entries. 
This can be viewed as a supervised learning problem with $2$-dimensional inputs, where the label of the input $( i , j )$ is $( W^* )_{i,j}$.
Under such a viewpoint, the observed entries are the training set, and the average reconstruction error over unobserved entries is the test error, quantifying generalization.
A predictor can then be thought of as a matrix, and a natural notion of complexity is its <em>rank</em>.
Indeed, in many real-world scenarios (a famous example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize">Netflix Prize</a>) one is interested in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.06422.pdf">recovering a low rank matrix from incomplete observations</a>.</p>

<p>A ‘‘deep learning approach’’ to matrix completion is matrix factorization, where the idea is to use a linear neural network (fully connected neural network with no non-linearity), and fit observations via gradient descent (GD). 
This amounts to optimizing the following objective:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
\[
 \min\nolimits_{W_1 , \ldots , W_L} ~ \sum\nolimits_{(i,j) \in observations} \big[ ( W_L \cdots W_1 )_{i , j} - (W^*)_{i,j} \big]^2 ~.
\]
</div>

<p>It is obviously possible to constrain the rank of the produced solution by limiting the shared dimensions of the weight matrices $\{ W_j \}_j$. 
However, from an implicit regularization standpoint, the most interesting case is where rank is unconstrained and the factorization can express any matrix. 
In this case there is no explicit regularization, and the kind of solution we get is determined implicitly by the parameterization and the optimization algorithm.</p>

<p>As it turns out, in practice, matrix factorization with near-zero initialization and small step size tends to accurately recover low rank matrices.
This phenomenon (first identified in <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/file/58191d2a914c6dae66371c9dcdc91b41-Paper.pdf">Gunasekar et al. 2017</a>) manifests some kind of implicit regularization, whose mathematical characterization drew a lot of interest.
It was initially conjectured that matrix factorization implicitly minimizes nuclear norm (<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/file/58191d2a914c6dae66371c9dcdc91b41-Paper.pdf">Gunasekar et al. 2017</a>), but recent evidence points to implicit rank minimization, stemming from incremental learning dynamics (see <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/file/c0c783b5fc0d7d808f1d14a6e9c8280d-Paper.pdf">Arora et al. 2019</a>; <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/file/f21e255f89e0f258accbe4e984eef486-Paper.pdf">Razin &amp; Cohen 2020</a>; <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf/e29b53584bc9017cb15b9394735cd51b56c32446.pdf">Li et al. 2021</a>). 
Today, it seems we have a relatively firm understanding of generalization in matrix factorization.
There is a complexity measure for predictors — matrix rank — by which implicit regularization strives to lower complexity, and the data itself is of low complexity (i.e. can be fit with low complexity). 
Jointly, these two conditions lead to generalization.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-matrix-factorization-tensor-factorization">Beyond matrix factorization: tensor factorization</h2>

<p>Matrix factorization is interesting on its own behalf, but as a theoretical surrogate for deep learning it is limited.
First, it corresponds to <em>linear</em> neural networks, and thus misses the crucial aspect of non-linearity. 
Second, viewing matrix completion as a prediction problem, it doesn’t capture tasks with more than two input variables.
As we now discuss, both of these limitations can be lifted if instead of matrices one considers tensors.</p>

<p>A tensor can be thought of as a multi-dimensional array.
The number of axes in a tensor is called its <em>order</em>.
In the task of <em>tensor completion</em>, a subset of entries from an unknown tensor $\mathcal{W}^* \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1, \ldots, d_N}$ are given, and the goal is to predict the unobserved entries. 
Analogously to how matrix completion can be viewed as a prediction problem over two input variables, order-$N$ tensor completion can be seen as a prediction problem over $N$ input variables (each corresponding to a different axis).
In fact, any multi-dimensional prediction task with discrete inputs and scalar output can be formulated as a tensor completion problem.
Consider for example the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database">MNIST dataset</a>, and for simplicity assume that image pixels hold one of two values, i.e. are either black or white. 
The task of predicting labels for the $28$-by-$28$ binary images can be seen as an order-$784$ (one axis for each pixel) tensor completion problem, where all axes are of length $2$ (corresponding to the number of values a pixel can take). 
For further details on how general prediction tasks map to tensor completion problems see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09972.pdf">our paper</a>.</p>

<br />
<i><b>Figure 2:</b> 
Prediction tasks can be viewed as tensor completion problems. <br />
For example, predicting labels for input images with $3$ pixels, each taking <br />
one of $5$ grayscale values, corresponds to completing a $5 \times 5 \times 5$ tensor.

</div>
<p><br />
Like matrices, tensors can be factorized. 
The most basic scheme for factorizing tensors, named CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP), parameterizes a tensor as a sum of outer products (for information on this scheme, as well as others, see the <a href="http://www.kolda.net/publication/TensorReview.pdf">excellent survey</a> of Kolda and Bader).
In <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09972.pdf">our paper</a> and this post, we use the term <em>tensor factorization</em> to refer to solving tensor completion by fitting observations via GD over CP parameterization, i.e. over the following objective ($\otimes$ here stands for outer product):</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
\[
\min\nolimits_{ \{ \mathbf{w}_r^n \}_{r , n} } \sum\nolimits_{ (i_1 , ... , i_N) \in observations } \big[ \big(  {\textstyle \sum}_{r = 1}^R \mathbf{w}_r^1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{w}_r^N \big)_{i_1 , \ldots , i_N} - (\mathcal{W}^*)_{i_1 , \ldots , i_N} \big]^2 ~.
\]
</div>

<p>The concept of rank naturally extends from matrices to tensors.
The <em>tensor rank</em> of a given tensor $\mathcal{W}$ is defined to be the minimal number of components (i.e. of outer product summands) $R$ required for CP parameterization to express it.
Note that for order-$2$ tensors, i.e. for matrices, this exactly coincides with matrix rank.
We can explicitly constrain the tensor rank of solutions found by tensor factorization via limiting the number of components $R$. 
However, since our interest lies on implicit regularization, we consider the case where $R$ is large enough for any tensor to be expressed.</p>

<p>By now you might be wondering what does tensor factorization have to do with deep learning.
Apparently, as Nadav mentioned in an <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2020/11/27/reg_dl_not_norm/">earlier post</a>, analogously to how matrix factorization is equivalent to matrix completion (two-dimensional prediction) via linear neural networks, tensor factorization is equivalent to tensor completion (multi-dimensional prediction) with a certain type of <em>non-linear</em> neural networks (for the exact details behind the latter equivalence see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09972.pdf">our paper</a>). 
It therefore represents a setting one step closer to practical neural networks.</p>

<p><br />
As a final piece of the analogy between matrix and tensor factorizations, in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06398.pdf">previous paper</a> (described in an <a href="https://www.offconvex.org/2020/11/27/reg_dl_not_norm/">earlier post</a>) Noam and Nadav demonstrated empirically that (similarly to the phenomenon discussed above for matrices) tensor factorization with near-zero initialization and small step size tends to accurately recover low rank tensors.
Our goal in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09972.pdf">current paper</a> was to mathematically explain this finding. 
To avoid the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.1393.pdf">notorious difficulty of tensor problems</a>, we chose to adopt a dynamical systems view, and analyze directly the trajectories induced by GD.</p>

<h2 id="dynamical-analysis-implicit-tensor-rank-minimization">Dynamical analysis: implicit tensor rank minimization</h2>

<p>So what can we say about the implicit regularization in tensor factorization? 
At the core of our analysis is the following dynamical characterization of component norms:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem:</strong>
Running gradient flow (GD with infinitesimal step size) over a tensor factorization with near-zero initialization leads component norms to evolve by:
[ \frac{d}{dt} || \mathbf{w}_r^1 (t) \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{w}_r^N (t) || \propto \color{brown}{|| \mathbf{w}_r^1 (t) \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{w}_r^N (t) ||^{2 - 2/N}} ~,
]
where $\mathbf{w}_r^1 (t), \ldots, \mathbf{w}_r^N (t)$ denote the weight vectors at time $t \geq 0$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the theorem above, component norms evolve at a rate proportional to their size exponentiated by $\color{brown}{2 - 2 / N}$ (recall that $N$ is the order of the tensor to complete).
Consequently, they are subject to a momentum-like effect, by which they move slower when small and faster when large. 
This suggests that when initialized near zero, components tend to remain close to the origin, and then, after passing a critical threshold, quickly grow until convergence. 
Intuitively, these dynamics induce an incremental process where components are learned one after the other, leading to solutions with a few large components and many small ones, i.e. to (approximately) low tensor rank solutions!</p>

<p>We empirically verified the incremental learning of components in many settings. 
Here is a representative example from one of our experiments (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09972.pdf">the paper</a> for more):</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">

<i><b>Figure 4:</b>

</i>
</div>
<p><br />
Using our dynamical characterization of component norms, we were able to prove that with sufficiently small initialization, tensor factorization (approximately) follows a trajectory of rank one tensors for an arbitrary amount of time. 
This leads to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem:</strong>
If tensor completion has a rank one solution, then under certain technical conditions, tensor factorization will reach it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s worth mentioning that, in a way, our results extend to tensor factorization the incremental rank learning dynamics known for matrix factorization (cf. <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/file/c0c783b5fc0d7d808f1d14a6e9c8280d-Paper.pdf">Arora et al. 2019</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09839v1.pdf">Li et al. 2021</a>). 
As typical when transitioning from matrices to tensors, this extension entailed various challenges that necessitated use of different techniques.</p>

<h2 id="tensor-rank-as-measure-of-complexity">Tensor rank as measure of complexity</h2>

<p>Going back to the beginning of the post, recall that a major challenge towards understanding implicit regularization in deep learning is that we lack measures for predictor complexity that capture natural data. 
Now, let us recap what we have seen thus far:
$(1)$ tensor completion is equivalent to multi-dimensional prediction; 
$(2)$ tensor factorization corresponds to solving the prediction task with certain non-linear neural networks; 
and 
$(3)$ the implicit regularization of these non-linear networks, i.e. of tensor factorization, minimizes tensor rank.
Motivated by these findings, we ask the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question:</strong> 
Can tensor rank serve as a measure of predictor complexity?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We empirically explored this prospect by evaluating the extent to which tensor rank captures natural data, i.e. to which natural data can be fit with predictors of low tensor rank.
As testbeds we used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database">MNIST</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist">Fashion-MNIST</a> datasets, comparing the resulting errors against those obtained when fitting two randomized variants: one generated via shuffling labels (‘‘rand label’’), and the other by replacing inputs with noise (‘‘rand image’’).</p>

<p>The following plot, displaying results for Fashion-MNIST (those for MNIST are similar), shows that with predictors of low tensor rank the original data is fit way more accurately than the randomized datasets. 
Specifically, even with tensor rank as low as one the original data is fit relatively well, while the error in fitting random data is close to trivial (variance of the label). 
This suggests that tensor rank as a measure of predictor complexity has potential to capture aspects of natural data! 
Note also that an accurate fit with low tensor rank coincides with low test error, which is not surprising given that low tensor rank predictors can be described with a small number of parameters.</p>

<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding thoughts</h2>

<p>Overall, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09972.pdf">our paper</a> shows that tensor rank captures both the implicit regularization of a certain type of non-linear neural networks, and aspects of natural data. 
In light of this, we believe tensor rank (or more advanced notions such as hierarchical tensor rank) might pave way to explaining both implicit regularization in more practical neural networks, and the properties of real-world data translating this implicit regularization to generalization.</p>
