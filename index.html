distances between their merge trees. Typical tasks include ensemble analysis,
feature tracking and symmetry or periodicity detection. Tree edit distances
represent how one tree can be transformed into another through a sequence of
simple edit operations: relabeling, insertion and deletion of nodes. In this
paper, we present a new set of edit operations working directly on the merge
tree as an geometrical or topological object: the represented operations are
deformation retractions and inverse transformations on merge trees, which
stands in contrast to other methods working on branch decomposition trees. We
present a quartic time algorithm for the new edit distance, which is branch
decomposition-independent and a metric on the set of all merge trees.

that vertices are distinct points, edges are Jordan arcs connecting their
endpoints, and edges intersect at most once (either in a proper crossing or in
a shared endpoint). Simple drawings are generalized twisted if there is a point
$O$ such that every ray emanating from $O$ crosses every edge of the drawing at
most once and there is a ray emanating from $O$ which crosses every edge
exactly once. We show that all generalized twisted drawings of $K_n$ contain
exactly $2n-4$ empty triangles, by this making a substantial step towards
proving the conjecture that this is the case for every simple drawing of $K_n$.

While the
cliques is too stiff to applicate to real cases, the k-plex relaxes the notion
of the clique, allowing each node to miss up to k connections. Although
k-plexes are more flexible than cliques, finding them is more challenging as
their number is greater. In this paper, we aim to detect the k-plex under the
size and time constraints, leveraging the new vision of automated learning
bounding strategy. We introduce the constraint learning concept to learn the
bound strategy from the branch and bound process and develop it into a Mixed
Integer Programming framework. While most of the work is dedicated on learn the
branch strategy in branch and bound-based algorithms, we focus on the learn to
bound strategy which needs to handle the problem that learned strategy might
not examine the feasible solution. We adopted the MILP framework and design a
set of variables relative to the k-plex property as our constraint space to
learn the strategy. The learn to bound strategy learning the original strategy
function also reduces the computation load of the bound process to accelerate
the branch and bound algorithm. Note that the learn to bound concept can apply
to any branch and bound based algorithm with the appropriate framework. We
conduct the experiment on different networks, the results show that our learn
to branch and bound method does accelerate the original branch and bound method
and outperforms other baselines, while also being able to generalize on
different graph properties.

<p><b>Authors: </b>John Rick D. Manzanares, Paul Samuel P. Ignacio <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.05565">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>Network centrality measures are concerned with evaluating the importance of
nodes, paths, or cycles based on directed or reciprocal interactions inherent
within graph structures encoded by vertices and edges. To accommodate
higher-order connections between nodes, Estrada and Ross extended graph-based
centrality measures to simplicial complexes by expanding node centrality to
simplices. We follow this extension but digress in the approach in that we
propose novel centrality measures by considering algebraically-computable
topological signatures of cycles and their homological persistence. We apply
tools from algebraic topology to extract multi-scale signatures within cycle
spaces of weighted graphs by tracking homology generators that persist across a
weight-induced filtration of simplicial complexes built over graphs. We take
these persistent signatures, as well as the merge information of homology
classes along the filtration to design centrality measures that quantify cycle
importance not only via its geometric and topological significance, but also by
its homological influence on other cycles. We also show that these measures are
stable under small perturbations allowed by an appropriate metric.

applications of vehicle routing such as medical emergencies, logistical
operations, and ride-sharing. We study a fundamental generalization of the
Traveling Salesman Problem, namely $L_p$ TSP, where the objective is to
minimize an aggregated measure of the delay in services, quantified by the
Minkowski $p$-norm of the delay vector. We present efficient combinatorial and
Linear Programming algorithms for approximating $L_p$ TSP on general metrics.
We provide several approximation algorithms for the $L_p$ TSP problem,
including $4.27$ &amp; $10.92$-approximation algorithms for single &amp; multi vehicle
$L_2$ TSP, called the Traveling Firefighter Problem. Among other contributions,
we provide an $8$-approximation and a $1.78$ inapproximability for All-Norm TSP
problem, addressing scenarios where one does not know the ideal cost function,
or is seeking simultaneous approximation with respect to any cost function.

[STOC 1999, SIDMA 2003] as a tool to solve partitioning problems. In this
paper, the following result concerning independent sets in graphs having
sparse-dense partitions is presented: if a $n$-vertex graph $G$ admits a
sparse-dense partition concerning classes $\mathcal S$ and $\mathcal D$, where
$\mathcal D$ is a subclass of the complement of $K_t$-free graphs (for some
~$t$), and graphs in $\mathcal S$ can be recognized in polynomial time, then:

<p>enumerate all maximal independent sets of $G$ (or find its maximum) can be
performed in $n^{O(1)}$ time whenever it can be done in polynomial time for

</p>
<p>This result has the following interesting implications:
</p>
<p>A P versus NP-hard dichotomy for Max. Independent Set on graphs whose vertex
set can be partitioned into $k$ independent sets and $\ell$ cliques, so-called
$(k, \ell)$-graphs. concerning the values of $k$ and $\ell$ of $(k,
\ell)$-graphs.
</p>
<p>A P-time algorithm that does not require $(1,\ell)$-partitions for
determining whether a $(1,\ell)$-graph $G$ is well-covered. Well-covered graphs
are graphs in which every maximal independent set has the same cardinality.

<p>The characterization of conflict graph classes for which the conflict version
of a P-time graph problem is still in P assuming such classes. Conflict

algorithms on graphs using their spectral properties. We present a simplified
proof of the result of Feige and Krauthgamer on the performance of the

result of Guruswami and Sinop that shows how to obtain approximation algorithms
for the Minimum Bisection problem on low threshold-rank graphs.
</p>
<p>We study inapproximability results for the SoS hierarchy for general
constraint satisfaction problems and problems involving graph densities such as
the Densest $k$-subgraph problem. We improve the existing inapproximability
results for general constraint satisfaction problems in the case of large
arity, using stronger probabilistic analyses of expansion of random instances.
We examine connections between constraint satisfaction problems and density
problems on graphs. Using them, we obtain new inapproximability results for the
hierarchy for the Densest $k$-subhypergraph problem and the Minimum $p$-Union
problem, which are proven via reductions.
</p>
<p>We also illustrate the relatively new idea of pseudocalibration to construct
integrality gaps for the SoS hierarchy for Maximum Clique and Max $K$-CSP. The
application to Max $K$-CSP that we present is known in the community but has
not been presented before in the literature, to the best of our knowledge.

On behalf of the concurrency theory community, I thank Kim for taking the time to answer my questions. I trust that readers of this blog will enjoy reading Kim's answer as much as I did. <span class="im"></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">Luca</span></b><span lang="EN-US">: You receive the CONCUR ToT Award 2022 for your paper  The Impressive Power of Stopwatches, which appeared at CONCUR 2000. </span>In that article, you showed that timed automata enriched with  stopwatches and unobservable time delays have the same expressive power  of  linear hybrid automata. Could you briefly explain to our readers  what timed automata with stopwatches are? Could  you also tell us how you came to study the question addressed in your  award-winning article? Which of the results in your paper did you find  most surprising or challenging?</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Kim:</b> <span class="im"></span><span lang="EN-US">Well, in timed automata all  clocks grow with rate 1 in all locations of the automata. Thus you can  tell the amount of time that has elapsed since a particular clock was  last reset, e.g. due to an external event of interest.   A stopwatch is a real-valued variable similar to a regular clock.  In  contrast to a clock, a stopwatch will in certain locations grow with  rate 1 and in other locations grow with rate 0, i.e. it is stopped.  As  such, a stopwatch gives you information about  the accumulated time spent in a certain parts of the automata.  </span></p><p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"></span><span lang="EN-US">In modelling schedulability  problems for real-time systems, the use of stopwatches is crucial in  order to adequately capture preemption.   I definitely believe that it  was our shared interest in schedulability that brought  us to study timed automata with stopwatches.  We knew from earlier  results by Alur et al. that properties such as reachability was  undecidable. But what could we do about this? And how much expressive  power would the addition of stopwatches provide?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"></span><span lang="EN-US">In the paper we certainly put the  most emphasis on the latter question, in that we showed that stopwatch  automata and linear hybrid automata accept the same class of timed  languages, and this was at least for me the most  surprising and challenging result.

The voicemail gave me the sad news that Juris Hartmanis, the person who founded computational complexity and brought me into it passed away earlier that day. I messaged Bill and told him to write <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/07/juris-hartmanis-passed-away-on-july-29.html">an obit</a> and I'd follow with something personal when I returned.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div><table cellpadding="0" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sMoKiQvVwB8/VVEMTLT-beI/AAAAAAAA2VQ/LMLeAxFklRg/s1600/GE.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sMoKiQvVwB8/VVEMTLT-beI/AAAAAAAA2VQ/LMLeAxFklRg/s400/GE.jpg" height="281" border="0" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center;" class="tr-caption">Hartmanis and Stearns in 1963</td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div>In November 1962 Hartmanis, working with Richard Stearns at the GE Labs in Schenectady, determined how to use Turing machines to formalize the basic idea to measure resources, like time and memory, as a function of the problem being solved. Their classic Turing-award winning paper <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1965-117-00/S0002-9947-1965-0170805-7/S0002-9947-1965-0170805-7.pdf">On the Computational Complexity of Algorithms</a>, not only gave this formulation but showed that increasing resources increased the problems one can solve.

Juris brought the topics to life and I found my passion. At the beginning of the class, he said the highest grade usually went to an undergrad followed by the grad students in the class. I was a counterexample, as I had the second highest grade. Never did find out who beat me out.</div><div><br /></div><div>In spring of my senior year, 1985, I forgave the traditional senior-slump <i>Wines</i> for graduate complexity with Juris. He focused the course around the <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2003/03/berman-hartmanis-isomorphism.html">isomorphism conjecture</a> he developed with his student Len Berman, which implied P≠NP, and Hartmanis believed using the conjecture might lead to settling P v NP.

<p>Last month saw a flurry of activity in Property Testing. We had thirteen papers!! Without further ado, let us dig in.</p>

<p><strong>Testing of Index-Invariant Properties in the Huge Object Model</strong> (by Sourav Chakraborty, Eldar Fischer, Arijit Ghosh, Gopinath Mishra, and Sayantan Sen)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12514">arXiv</a>) This paper explores a class of distribution testing problems in the Huge Object Model introduced by Goldreich and Ron (see our coverage of the model <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2021/10/news-for-september-2021/">here</a>). A quick refresher of this model: so, suppose you want to test whether a distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) supported over, say the boolean hypercube \(\{0,1\}^n\) has a certain property \(\mathcal{P}\). You pick a string \(x \sim \mathcal{D}\) where the length of \(x\) is \(n\). In situations where \(n\) is really large, you might not want to read all of \(x\) and you may instead want to read only a few bits from it. To this end, Goldreich and Ron formulated a model where you have query access to the strings you sample. The distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) is deemed to be \(\varepsilon\)-far from \(\mathcal{P}\) if \(EMD(\mathcal{D}, \mathcal{P}) \geq \varepsilon\) (here \(EMD\) denotes the earthmover distance with respect to the relative Hamming distance between bitstrings).  In this model, one parameter of interest is the query complexity of your tester.</p>



<p>One of the results in the featured paper above shows the following: Let \(\sf{MONOTONE}\) denote the class of monotone distributions supported over \(\{0,1\}^n\) (a distribution \(D\)  belongs to the class \(\sf{MONOTONE}\) if \(D(x) \leq D(y)\) whenever \(0^n \preceq x \preceq y \preceq 1^n\)). Let \(\mathcal{B}_d\) denote the class of distributions supported over \(\{0,1\}^n\) whose supports have VC dimension at most \(d\). Let \(\mathcal{P} = \sf{MONOTONE} \cap \mathcal{B}_d\). Then, for any \(\varepsilon &gt; 0\), you can test whether a distribution \(\mathcal{D} \in \mathcal{P}\) or whether it is \(\varepsilon\)  far from \(\mathcal{P}\) with query complexity \(poly(1/\varepsilon)\). In fact, the paper shows this for a much richer class \(\mathcal{P}\) which is the class of so-called <em>index-invariant</em> distributions with bounded VC-dimensions. The paper also shows the necessity of both of these conditions for efficient testability. Do check it out!</p>

<p><strong>Identity Testing for High-Dimensional Distributions via Entropy Tensorization</strong> (by Antonio Blanca, Zongchen Chen, Daniel Štefankovič, and Eric Vigoda)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09102">arXiv</a>) </p>



<p>This paper considers a classic in distribution testing. Namely, the problem of testing whether the hidden input distribution \(\pi\) is identical to an explicitly given distribution \(\mu\). Both distributions are supported over a set \(\Omega\). The caveat is \(\Omega\) is some high dimensional set (think \(\Omega = [k]^n\)) and that it has a size that grows exponentially in \(n\). In this case, identity testing has sample complexity \(\Omega(k^{n/2})\) even when \(\mu\) is the uniform distribution. In an attempt to overcome this apparent intractability of identity testing in high dimensions, this paper takes the following route: in addition to the standard sample access to \(\pi\), you also assume access to a <em>stronger sampling oracle</em> from \(\pi\). And now you would like to understand for which class of explicitly given distributions \(\mu\) can you expect algorithms with efficient sample complexity (assuming the algorithm is equipped with this <em>stronger sampling oracle</em>). For any \(i \in [n]\) and \(\omega \in \Omega\), the stronger oracle considered in this work allows you to sample \(x \sim \pi_{\omega(-i)}\) where \(\pi_{\omega(-i)}\) denotes the conditional marginal distribution of \(\pi\) over the \(i\)-th coordinate when the remaining coordinates have been fixed according to \(\omega\).</p>



<p>The paper shows if the known distribution \(\mu\) satisfies some approximate tensorization of entropy criterion, then identity testing with such distributions \(\mu\) can be done with \(\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)\) queries. Thanks to the spectral independence toolkit pioneered by Anari et al, it turns out that the approximate tensorization property holds for a rich class of distributions. (<em>A side note to self</em>: It looks like I am running out of reasons to postpone learning about the new tools like Spectral Independence.)   </p>

<p><strong>Near-Optimal Bounds for Testing Histogram Distributions</strong> (by Clément L. Canonne, Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel M. Kane, and Sihan Liu)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06596">arXiv</a>) Histograms comprise one of the most natural and widely used ways for summarizing some relevant aspects of massive datasets. Let \(\Omega\) denote an \(n\)-element dataset (with elements being \(\{1,2, \ldots, n \}\)). A \(k\)-histogram is a function that is piecewise constant over \(k\) interval pieces. This paper studies the sample complexity of the following fundamental task: given a distribution \(\mathcal{P}\) supported over \(\Omega\), is \(\mathcal{P}\) a \(k\)-histogram or is \(\mathcal{P}\) far from being a \(k\)-histogram. The main result of the paper is a (near) sample optimal algorithm for this problem. Specifically, this paper shows that \(k\)-histogram testing has sample complexity \(\Theta\left(\sqrt{nk}/\varepsilon + k/\varepsilon^2 + \sqrt{n}/\varepsilon^2\right)\).</p>



<p><strong>Comments on “Testing Conditional Independence of Discrete Distributions”</strong> (by Ilmun Kim)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02819">arXiv</a>) Probability is full of subtleties and conditional probability is perhaps the biggest landmine of subtleties in this venerable discipline. The featured paper closely examines some subtleties in Theorem 1.3 of the CDKS18 paper on testing conditional independence of discrete distributions. Essentially, this theorem undertakes the following endeavor: you would like to test whether a bivariate discrete distribution has independent marginals conditioned on values assumed by a third random variable. Theorem 1.3 of CDKS18 asserts that there exists a computationally efficient tester for conditional independence with small sample complexity. The featured paper fixes the sample complexity bound claimed in Theorem 1.3 of CDKS18.</p>

<p><strong>Cryptographic Hardness of Learning Halfspaces with Massart Noise</strong> (by Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel M. Kane, Pasin Manurangsi, and Lisheng Ren)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14266">arXiv</a>) The study of robust supervised learning in high dimensions has seen a lot of impressive progress in the last few years. The paper under review presents sample complexity lower bounds for the task of learning halfspaces in this overarching framework. Let us unpack this paper slowly. So, let us recall the classic task of learning halfspaces in \(\mathbb{R}^n\). You know the drill. I have a known concept class \(\mathcal{C}\) (comprising of boolean functions) in my hand. Unbeknownst to you, I have a boolean function \(f \in \mathcal{C}\). You get as input a multiset \(\{x_i, f(x_i)\}_{i \in [s]}\) of labeled examples from a distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) where \(x_i \sim \mathcal{D}_x\) and \(\mathcal{D}_x\) is fixed but arbitrary. Your goal is to develop an algorithm that returns a hypothesis with a small misclassification rate. The classic stuff.</p>



<p>Now, consider the same setup with a little twist: the so-called Massart noise setup. The labels \(f(x_i)\) are no longer reliable and the label on each \(x_i\) gets flipped adversarially with probability \(\eta_i \leq \eta &lt; 1/2\). In a breakthrough Diakonikolas, Gouleakis, and Tzamos made the first algorithmic progress on this problem and gave algorithms with running time \(poly(n/\varepsilon)\) and misclassification rate \(\eta + \varepsilon\). The current paper shows a lower-bound result. Assuming the hardness of the so-called “Learning With Errors” problem, this paper shows that under Massart Noise, it is not possible for a polynomial time learning algorithm to achieve a misclassification rate of \(o(\eta)\).</p>

<p><strong>Locally-iterative (Δ+1)-Coloring in Sublinear (in Δ) Rounds</strong> (by Xinyu Fu, Yitong Yin, and Chaodong Zheng)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14458">arXiv</a>) A time-honored problem in Distributed Computing is Distributed graph coloring. Let us first understand what problem this paper studies. So, you are given a graph \(G = (V,E)\) with maximum degree \(\Delta\). In a seminal work, Szegedy and Vishwanathan introduced the framework of <em>locally-iterative algorithms</em> as a natural family of distributed graph coloring algorithms. These algorithms proceed in \(r\) rounds. In each round, you update the color of a vertex \(v\) where the new color of \(v\) is a function of the current color of \(v\) and the current color of its neighbors. The current paper shows that you can in the locally-iterative framework, you can in fact, obtain a proper coloring of \(G\) with \(\Delta(G) + 1\) colors in \(r = O(\Delta^{3/4} \log \Delta) + \log^* n\) rounds. </p>

<p><strong>Learning Hierarchical Structure of Clusterable Graphs</strong> (by Michael Kapralov, Akash Kumar, Silvio Lattanzi, Aida Mousavifar)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02581">arXiv</a>) [<em>Disclaimer: I am one of the authors of this paper.</em>] Hierarchical clustering of graph data is a fundamentally important task in the current big data era. In 2016, Dasgupta introduced the notion of Dasgupta cost which essentially allows one to measure the quality of a hierarchical clustering. This paper presents algorithms that can estimate the Dasgupta Cost of a graph coming from a special family of \(k\)-clusterable graphs in the semi-supervised setting. These graphs have \(k\) clusters. These clusters are essentially subsets of vertices that induce expanders and these clusters are sparsely connected to each other. We are given query access to the adjacency list of \(G\). Also, for an initial “warmup” set of randomly chosen vertices, we are told the clusters they belong to. Armed with this setup, this paper presents algorithms that run in time \(\approx \sqrt{n}\) and return an estimate to the Dasgupta Cost of \(G\) which is within a \(\approx \sqrt{\log k}\) factor of the optimum cost.</p>

<p><strong>Finding a Hidden Edge</strong> (by Ron Kupfer and Noam Nisan)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02344">arXiv</a>) Let us consider as a warmup (as done in the paper) the following toy problem. You have a graph on \(n\) vertices whose edge set \(E\) is hidden from you. Your objective is to return any \((i,j) \in E\). The only queries you are allowed are of the following form. You may consider any subset \(Q \subseteq V \times V\) and you can ask whether \(Q\) contains any edge. A simple binary search solves this question with \(\log m\) queries (where \(m = {n \choose 2}\)). However, if you want a non-adaptive algorithm for this problem (unlike binary search) you can show that any deterministic algorithm must issue \(m\) non-adaptive queries. Turns out randomness can help you get away with only \(O(\log^2m)\) non-adaptive queries for this special toy problem. Now, let me describe the problem considered in this work in earnest. Suppose the only queries you are allowed are of the following form: you may pick any \(S \subseteq V\) and you may ask whether the graph induced on \(S\) contains an edge. The paper’s main result is that there is an algorithm for finding an edge in \(G\) which issues nearly linear in \(n\) many non-adaptive queries. The paper also presents an almost matching lower bound.</p>

<p><strong>On One-Sided Testing Affine Subspaces</strong> (by Nader Bshouty)(<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/104/">ECCC</a>) Dictatorship testing is one of the classics in property testing of boolean functions. A more generalized problem considers testing whether the presented function is a \(k\)-monomial. If you are a regular reader of the posts on PTReview, you might have seen this problem essentially asks you to test whether a boolean function \(f \colon \mathcal{F}^n \to {0,1}\) is an indicator of an \((n-d)\) dimensional affine/linear subspace of \(\mathcal{F}^n\) (here \(\mathcal{F}\) denotes a finite field). Namely, you would like to test whether the set \(f^{-1}\) is an \((n-k)\) dimensional affine subspace of \(\mathcal{F}^n\). The paper under review improves the state-of-the-art query complexity for this problem from a previous value of \(O\left(|\mathcal{F}|/\varepsilon\right)\) to \(\tilde{O}\left(1/\varepsilon\right)\).</p>

<p><strong>Non-Adaptive Edge Counting and Sampling via Bipartite Independent Set Queries</strong> (by Raghavendra Addanki, Andrew McGregor, and Cameron Musco)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02817">arXiv</a>) If you have been around the PTReview corner for a while, you know that sublinear time estimation of graph properties is one of our favorite pastimes here. Classic work in this area considers the following queries: vertex degree queries, \(i\)-th neighbor queries, and edge existence queries. This classic query model has received a lot of attention and thanks to the work of Eden and Rosenbaum we know algorithms for near-uniform edge sampling with query complexity \(O(n/\sqrt{m}) \cdot poly(\log n) \cdot poly(1/\varepsilon)\). Motivated by a desire to obtain more query-efficient algorithms, Beame et al. introduced an augmented query model where you are also allowed the following queries: you may pick \(L, R \subseteq V\) and you get a yes/no response indicating whether there exists an edge in \(E(L, R)\). These are also called the bipartite independent set <em>(BIS)</em> queries. The featured paper shows that with (<em>BIS</em>) queries you get <em>non-adaptive</em> algorithms for near-uniform edge sampling with query complexity being a mere \(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-4} \log^6 n)\). The main result of the paper gives a non-adaptive algorithm for estimating the number of edges in \(G\) with query complexity (under <em>BIS</em>) being a mere \(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-5} \log^5 n)\).</p>

<p><strong>A Query-Optimal Algorithm for Finding Counterfactuals</strong> (by Guy Blanc, Caleb Koch, Jane Lange, Li-Yang Tan)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07072">arXiv</a>) Given an abstract space \(X^d\), an instance \(x^* \in X^d\) and a model \(f\) (which you think of as a boolean function over \(X^d\)), a point \(x’ \in X^d\) is called a counterfactual to \(x^*\) if \(x^*, x’\) differ in few features (i.e., have a small Hamming distance) and \(f(x^*) \neq f(x’)\). Ideally, you would like to find counterfactuals that are as close to each other in Hamming Distance. The main result of this paper is the following: Take a monotone model \(f \colon \{0,1\}^d \to \{0,1\}\), an instance \(x^* \in \{0,1\}^d\) with small sensitivity (say \(\alpha\)). Then there exists an algorithm that makes at most \(\alpha^{\Delta(x^*)}\) queries to \(f\) and returns all optimal counterfactuals of \(f\). Here \(\Delta(x^*) = \min_{x \in \{0,1\}^d} \{\Delta_H(x, x^*) \colon f(x) \neq f(x^*) \}\). The paper also proves a matching lower bound on query complexity which is obtained by some monotone model \(f\).</p>

<p><strong>A Sublinear-Time Quantum Algorithm for Approximating Partition Functions</strong> (by Arjan Cornelissen and Yassine Hamoudi)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08643">arXiv</a>) For the classical Hamiltonian \(H \colon \Omega \to \{0,1, \ldots, n\}\), at inverse temperature \(\beta\), the probability, under the so-called Gibbs distribution, assigned to a state \(x \in \Omega\) is proportional to \(\exp(-\beta H(x))\). The partition function is given by \(Z(\beta) = \sum_{x \in \Omega} \exp(-\beta H(x))\). At high temperatures (or low values of \(\beta\)) the partition function is typically easy to compute. However, the low-temperature regime is often challenging. You use MCMC methods to compute \(Z(\infty)\). In particular, you write this as the following telescoping product \(Z(\infty) = Z(0) \cdot \prod_{i = 0}^{i = \ell – 1} \frac{Z(\beta_{i+1})}{Z(\beta_i)}\) where \(0 = \beta_1 &lt; \beta_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; \beta_{\ell} = \infty\) is some increasing sequence of inverse temperatures with limited fluctuations in Gibbs distribution between two consecutive values and you use MCMC methods to estimate each of the \(\ell\) ratios in the above product. The main result of this paper presents a quantum algorithm that on input a Gibbs distribution generated by a Markov Chain with a large spectral gap performs sublinearly few steps (in size of the logarithm of the state space) of the quantum walk operator and returns a \(\pm \varepsilon Z(\infty)\) additive estimate to \(Z(\infty)\).</p>

<p><strong>A Near-Cubic Lower Bound for 3-Query Locally Decodable Codes from Semirandom CSP Refutation</strong> (by Omar Alrabiah, Venkatesan Guruswami, Pravesh Kothari, and Peter Manohar)(<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/101/">ECCC</a>) If you made it till here, it is time for a treat. Let us close (hopefully, I did not miss any papers this time!) with a breakthrough in Locally Decodable Codes. So, for 2-query LDCs, we know fairly tight bounds on the block length. For 3-query LDCs, on the other hand, we know a sub-exponential upper bound on the block length. However, the best-known lower bound on the block length was merely quadratic. The featured paper improves this to a cubic lower bound on the block length. The main tool used to achieve this is a surprising connection between the existence of locally decodable codes and the refutation of Boolean CSP instances with limited randomness. This looks like a fantastic read to close off this month’s report!</p></div>

<p> Dan Spielman asked me to blog about the Held Prize. I first present what he send me, and then have some thoughts.</p><p><br /></p><p>FROM DAN: </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Nominations are now being accepted for the National Academy of Sciences’ 2023 Michael and Sheila Held Prize. The Held Prize honors outstanding, innovative, creative, and influential research in the areas of combinatorial and discrete optimization, or related parts of computer science, such as the design and analysis of algorithms and complexity theory. This $100,000 prize is intended to recognize recent work (defined as published within the last eight years). Additional information, including past recipients, eligibility requirements, and more, can be found at <a href="http://www.nasonline.org/programs/awards/michael-and-sheila-held-prize.html">here</a>.</p><p>All nominations must be submitted online. Unless otherwise stated, the following materials must be submitted: </p><p>A letter from the nominator describing the candidate's work and why he or she should be selected for the award. No more than three (3) pages.</p><p>Curriculum vitae. No more than two (2) pages (similar to CVs included with NSF proposals).</p><p>Bibliography listing no more than twelve (12) of the nominee's most significant publications.</p><p>Suggested citation. A 50-word summary stating why the nominee should be considered for this award. (Citation</p><p>examples)</p><p>Two letters of support. Support letters must be written by individuals from institutions outside both the</p><p>nominator's and the nominee’s institution. Up to three letters of support are accepted.</p><p>Nominations will be accepted through Monday, October 3, 2022. Please help spread the word that the nomination process is underway. </p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>BILL COMMENTS</p><p>1) The scope seems rather broad (Dan confirmed this in private email) in that its Comb Opt AND Discrete Opt OR related fields like algorithms and complexity theory. </p><p>2) The research has to be Outstanding AND Innovative AND creative AND influential. That seems hard to do :-(  If they made it an OR instead of an AND I may ask someone to nominate me for my Muffin Work. It does use 0-1 programming!</p><p>3) The past winners are, of course, very impressive. But there is one I want to point out to emphasize that the scope is broad: Amit Sahai won in 2022, and here is what the webpage says about it:</p><p>For a leading role in development of cryptographic Software Obfuscation and its applications, starting from initial conception of "Indistinguishability Obfuscation" and culminating in new constructions based upon well-founded cryptographic assumptions. These breakthroughs highlight how computational complexity can enable secrecy while computing in insecure environments.</p><p>4) Comb Opt and Discrete Opt seem to be Operations Research. So this inspires the following question:</p><p><i>What are the similarities and differences between Operations Research and Research on Algorithms?</i> </p><p>I tend to think of Operations Research  as being more tied to the real world- but is that true?</p><p>5) Not enough 2-letter combinations  for what you want to say: I had to use the term <i>Operations Research </i>instead of the abbreviation OR since I was using OR for or. Oh well. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

<p>Science magazine has an article written by Adrian Cho <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/ordinary-computers-can-beat-google-s-quantum-computer-after-all">Ordinary computers can beat Google’s quantum computer after all</a>. It is about the remarkable progress in classical simulations of sampling task like those sampling tasks that led to the 2019 Google’s announcement of “quantum supremacy”. I reported about the breakthrough paper of Feng Pan and Pan Zhang <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2021/03/10/amazing-feng-pan-and-pan-zhang-announced-a-way-to-spoof-classically-simulate-the-googles-quantum-supremacy-circuit/">in this post</a> and there are updates in the post itself and the comment section about a variety of related works by several groups of researchers.</p>
<p>The very short summary is that by now classical algorithms are ten orders of magnitude faster than those used in the Google paper and hence the speed-up is ten orders of magnitude lower than Google’s fantastic claims. (The Google paper claims that their ultimate task that required 300 seconds for the quantum computer will require 10,000 years on a powerful supercomputers. with the new algorithms the task can be done in a matter of seconds.)</p>
<p>Also regarding the Google supremacy paper, my paper with Yosi Rinott and Tomer Shoham,  <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2022/08/sts836.pdf">Statistical Aspects of the Quantum Supremacy Demonstration,</a> just appeared in “Statistical Science”. (Click on the link for the journal version.) The Google 2019 paper and, more generally, NISQ experiments raise various interesting statistical issues. (In addition, it is important to double check various statistical claims of the paper.) One of our findings is that there is a large gap between the empirical distribution and the Google noise model. I hope to devote some future post to our paper and to some further research we were doing.</p>
<p>The leaking of the Google paper in September 23, 2019 led to huge media and academic attention and many very enthusiastic reactions.  I also wrote here on the blog a <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/11/13/gils-collegial-quantum-supremacy-skepticism-faq/">few</a> <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/23/quantum-computers-amazing-progress-google-ibm-and-extraordinary-but-probably-false-supremacy-claims-google/">critical</a> <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/10/13/the-story-of-poincare-and-his-friend-the-baker/">posts</a> about the Google claims.</p>
<p>Here is a figure with the price of bitcoin around the time of the Google quantum supremacy (unintended) announcement.</p>

We show that lower bounds on the border rank of matrix multiplication can be used to non-trivially derandomize polynomial identity testing for small algebraic circuits. Letting $\underline{R}(n)$ denote the border rank of $n \times n \times n$ matrix multiplication, we construct a hitting set generator with seed length $O(\sqrt{n} \cdot \underline{R}^{-1}(s))$ that hits $n$-variate circuits of multiplicative complexity $s$. If the matrix multiplication exponent $\omega$ is not 2, our generator has seed length $O(n^{1 - \varepsilon})$ and hits circuits of size $O(n^{1 + \delta})$ for sufficiently small $\varepsilon, \delta &gt; 0$. Surprisingly, the fact that $\underline{R}(n) \ge n^2$ already yields new, non-trivial hitting set generators for circuits of sublinear multiplicative complexity.</div>

Concretely efficient interactive oracle proofs (IOPs) are of interest due to their applications to scaling blockchains, their minimal security assumptions, and their potential future-proof resistance to quantum attacks.

Scalable IOPs, in which prover time scales quasilinearly with the computation size and verifier time scales poly-logarithmically with it, have been known to exist thus far only over a set of finite fields of negligible density, namely, over "FFT-friendly" fields that contain a sub-group of size  $2^k$.

Our main result is to show that scalable IOPs can be constructed over any sufficiently large finite field, of size that is at least quadratic in the length of computation whose integrity is proved by the IOP. This result has practical applications as well, because it reduces the proving and verification complexity of cryptographic statements that are naturally stated over pre-defined finite fields which are not "FFT-friendly".

Prior state-of-the-art scalable IOPs relied heavily on arithmetization via univariate polynomials and Reed--Solomon codes over FFT-friendly fields. To prove our main result and extend scalability to all large finite fields, we generalize the prior techniques and use new algebraic geometry codes evaluated on sub-groups of elliptic curves (elliptic curve codes). We also show a new arithmetization scheme that uses the rich and well-understood group structure of elliptic curves to reduce statements of computational integrity to other statements about the proximity of functions evaluated on the elliptic curve to the new family of elliptic curve codes.

This paper continues our recent work [Ben-Sasson et al., ECCC TR21-103] that used elliptic curves and their subgroups to create FFT-based algorithms for polynomial manipulation over generic finite fields. However, our new IOP constructions force us to use new codes (ones that are not based on polynomials), and this poses a new set of challenges involving the more restricted automorphism group of these codes, and the constraints of Riemann--Roch spaces of strictly positive genus.</div>

<p><strong>Scott’s Introduction</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Hartmanis">Juris Hartmanis</a> — one of the founding figures of theoretical computer science, winner of the Turing Award, cofounder of the Cornell computer science department (of which I’m an alumnus), cofounder of the <a href="https://computationalcomplexity.org/">Conference on Computational Complexity</a> or CCC (which I just attended), PhD adviser to many of the <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/hartmanisstud.pdf">leading complexity theorists</a> — has passed away at age 94.</p>



<p>Scientifically, Hartmanis will be remembered as long as our field exists for several contributions.  First and foremost, his 1965 proof, with Richard Stearns, of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_hierarchy_theorem">time</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_hierarchy_theorem">space</a> hierarchy theorems, which adapt Turing’s undecidability theorems to show that there exist computable problems that are arbitrarily hard (and thus, if you like, that the new field of computational complexity theory would have a subject matter).  Second, his and Berman’s investigation, in the 1970s, of the detailed structure of NP-complete problems (are they “paddable”? can they be <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2016/162/download/">sparse</a>? are all NP-complete sets <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/manindra/survey/Isomorphism-Conjecture.pdf">polynomial-time isomorphic</a>?  or as we now believe, are they not?), which helped start the whole area of “structural complexity theory” (the original subject matter of the CCC conference).  Third, his investigations of logic and complexity theory, including whether problems like P vs. NP could be <a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/indep.pdf">independent</a> of the axioms of set theory, and the relations of that question to relativization and oracles.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/07/29/juris-hartmanis-1928-2022/">this memorial post</a> by Richard Lipton and Ken Regan points out, some of Hartmanis’s most important contributions are so basic that it feels weird today even to mention them explicitly: the use of Turing machines to model computational complexity (!).  The study of complexity via “complexity classes,” consisting of all problems solvable within a given resource bound.  The whole <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Complexity_Zoo">Complexity Zoo</a> could’ve been renamed Jurisic Park.</p>



<p>One of my regrets in life is that I didn’t get to know Hartmanis well when I was an undergrad at Cornell.  (This was a stage of my life when I was still intimidated by my professors, or hyper-mega-intimidated if they were Juris Hartmanis.)  I actually conversed with him more after I’d graduated and returned for visits.  He was so considerate and kind, almost grandfatherly, that I realized how foolish I was not to have sought him out as a student.</p>



<p>There was, however, another undergrad at Cornell at the same time as me, who wasn’t <em>quite</em> as intimidated as I was, and who ended up doing an independent study with Hartmanis, about the possibility of complete problems for NP∩coNP if I remember correctly.  This undergrad’s real goal was to solve the P vs. NP problem, which might sound ridiculous until I tell you that his name was <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rrw/">Ryan Williams</a>.  I asked Ryan to share his own memories of Juris, and he’s graciously done so below.  You won’t regret reading this.  —SA</p>

<p><strong>Juris Hartmanis by Ryan Williams</strong></p>



<p>I am extremely sad that Professor Juris Hartmanis has passed away. He made an enormous impact on my early career, and on my growth as a scientist: arguably, I wouldn’t be a scientist at all without him. He was extraordinarily gentle, inspiring, and encouraging to me.</p>



<p>My story of how I know Professor Hartmanis is really my “origin story” as a theoretical computer scientist. So I’ll tell you a little about the situation before I met him, to give some before/after context.</p>



<p>As a freshman at Cornell learning math and computer science, I became captivated by P vs NP and P vs PSPACE. In my teenage hubris, I planned it out: in the spring I’d take discrete math, fall I’d take the intro to theory of computing, and the following spring I’d take the grad complexity course being taught by Prof. Hartmanis that term. After that, I’d go to grad school in theory, and somewhere along the way tackle P vs NP. Simple enough…</p>



<p>I did fine in discrete math, but struggled in intro to theory, partly due to the fact that the lectures (and exams) were at 9am. I managed to do well on the final and earned a B+. I began to wonder if my plan was unsound. I went to the instructor and told them of my plan. They recommended that I should not try for grad school, as I didn’t seem to be particularly talented and there were “no jobs in theory”. (Jobs? Who needs jobs?) I asked if my chances of getting in grad school would be improved if I did well in the grad complexity class. They said “maybe”, and that was enough to keep me going.</p>



<p>The vibe in Prof. Hartmanis’ class was amazing. He was exceptionally passionate about teaching complexity. His lectures were a revelation; they were exhilarating. He stayed laser-focused on communicating the heart of the ideas, with brevity and levity as needed to avoid the technical details (often nasty in the case of Turing machines). In the margins of my own class notes, I jotted down countless one-liners and antics. One of my favorite memories is that, when he wanted to be done with a proof and was tired of further questions, he would write his Q.E.D. symbol very large, with a little intimidating devil inside of it, like so:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/devil.png" alt="" /></figure></div>


<p>As he’d often be packing more material in the lecture than time allowed, he joked that he wasn’t responsible for what was said in the last five minutes of class (when he’d rush to cover what remained). He was having so much <em>fun</em> with the material, and he repeatedly showed that one could think about these very deep and complex things very simply. My intuition for complexity grew so fast that the rest of my mathematical education was lifted immeasurably by it.</p>



<p>In response, I began to take my studies very seriously that semester. I showed up to every session of his office hours. I peppered him with questions after class. He was unwaveringly patient, helping me sort out my latest confusion. Eventually my questions turned into actual research problems, which occasionally received interesting answers (mostly already answered in the literature). After the semester ended, I began to schedule weekly meetings with him, discussing anything and everything complexity. He always seemed happy to chat, and during conversations he made the development of my research taste a top priority. He made it clear when what I was saying was interesting to him, and when it wasn’t… and if it wasn’t, I needed to explain why I found it interesting. But I understood that all of this was for my education as a future theoretical computer scientist, which he treated as inevitable.</p>



<p>I don’t know why Professor Hartmanis believed in me. During that period in my life, I felt like nobody else did, and it felt odd that the Turing Award winner was the one who believed the most. On the coattails of his eager recommendation, I was able to attend an REU at DIMACS. Later he was shocked and annoyed when in spite of his letter, I was rejected from every grad school I applied to (I suppose the B+ didn’t help). However, probably owing to Prof. Hartmanis’ stature at the NSF, I was still awarded an NSF grad fellowship. When I told him of the good and bad news, and that I had no Plan B, he immediately picked up the phone and called someone explaining the situation. He hung up and announced “Congratulations Ryan, you have been admitted to the MEng program.” So I spent the next year in Ithaca as an MEng student. He informed me he was retiring, and maybe grad programs are getting skeptical of complexity. Maybe I should try to sneak in by studying something adjacent. He suggested working with Bart Selman on SAT (which I did). My confidence was shaken by the rejections but, seeing how strongly he believed in me, I could not let him down.</p>



<p>He was always full of affirmations for me, with a trademark mix of humor and motivation. After I would report a batch of new observations, he would say something like: “As they say, the biggest pig eats the most potatoes. And you sir, are a very big pig!” After I had a paper accepted to SODA, he declared that I was now a computer scientist. After I had a paper accepted to IJCAI, he declared that I had become a world-famous computer scientist. Prof. Hartmanis remained my strongest champion and loudest cheerleader in research, until I was finally admitted to some grad schools the next time around.</p>



<p>I’m immensely grateful to have known him. Without his faith, I’d have never become a theoretical computer scientist. Without his initial influence, I’d have never been a good one. I’ve been writing entirely through tears; I hope for everyone reading that they too have the chance to impact a young person’s life so profoundly.</p>

<p> Juris Hartmanis, one of the founders of Complexity Theory, passed away on July 29 at the age of 94.  The Gödel's Last Letter blog has an obit posted <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/">here</a>.  Scott Aaronson has some words and a guest post by Ryan Williams <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6622">here</a>. When other bloggers post obits I will update this paragraph to point to them. </p><p>Here is one non-blog obit: <a href="https://usobit.com/obituaries-2022/juris-hartmanis-july-5-1928-july-29-2022-age-94/">here</a>.  For an interview with Juris see <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2736346">here</a>.</p><p>Hartmanis and Stearns shared the 1993  Turing award for the paper <i>On the Computational Complexity of</i> <i>Algorithms </i>(see <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1965-117-00/S0002-9947-1965-0170805-7/S0002-9947-1965-0170805-7.pdf">here</a> for the paper and see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/194313.214781">here</a> for his Turing Award Talk). In that paper they define DTIME(T(n)) for Turing Machines. They also proved some theorems about how changes to the model (1-tape, 2-tape, 1-dim, 2-dim others) change the notion of DTIME(T(n))- so they were well aware that the definition was not robust. They also have some theorems about computable numbers. </p><p>We are used to the notion that you can measure how long a computation takes my counting the number of steps on a Turing Machine. Before the Hartmanis-Stearns paper this was not how people thought of things. Knuth (I suspect independently) was looking at what we might now call concrete complexity- how many operations does an algorithm need. Hartmanis-Stearns were beginning what is now called Complexity Theory. </p><p> Recall that later, the Cook-Levin Theorem used Turing Machines. </p><p>If Hartmanis-Stearns did not start the process of putting complexity on a rigorous mathematical basis how might complexity theory have evolved? It is possible we would not have the Cook-Levin Theorem or the notion of NP. It is possible that we would ASSUME that SAT is hard and use that to get other problems hard, and also do reverse reductions as well to get some problems equivalent to SAT. Indeed- this IS what we do in other parts of theory with assuming the following problems are hard (for various definitions of hard): 3SUM, APSP, Unique Games. And in Crypto Factoring, DL, SVP, and other problems. </p><p>Hartmanis did other things as well. I list some of them that are of interest to me - other people will likely list other things of interest to them. </p><p>0) He had 21 PhD Students, some of them quite prominent. The list of them is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/hartmanisstud.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>1) The Berman-Hartmanis Conjecture: All NP-Complete sets are poly isomorphic. Seems true for all natural NP-complete sets. Still open. This conjecture inspired a lot of work on sparse sets including that if a sparse set S is btt-hard for NP, then P=NP (proven by Ogiwara-Watanabe)</p><p>2) The Boolean Hierarchy: we all know what NP is. What about sets that are the <i>difference </i>of two NP sets? What about sets of the form A - (B-C) where A,B,C are all in NP? These form a hierarchy. We of course do not know if the hierarchy is proper, but if it collapse then PH collapses.</p><p>3) He helped introduce time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity into complexity theory, see <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4568108">here</a>.</p><p>4) He was Lance Fortnow's undergraduate advisor. </p><p>5) There is more but I will stop here.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

Juris Hartmanis passed away this morning. He was a professor in Cornell’s computer science department since 1965. He won the 1993 Turing Award with Richard Stearns for their 1963–1965 <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1965-117-00/S0002-9947-1965-0170805-7/">paper</a> “On the Computational Complexity of Algorithms.”</p>
<p>
Today, Dick and I express our condolences and also appreciation for a long life and career shaping our field of computational complexity theory. </p>
<p>
One mark of a long life is that the <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-4478-3">Complexity Theory Retrospective</a> volume honoring his 60th birthday in 1988 was longer ago than the beginning of my tenure-track career at Buffalo in 1989. In the early 1980s, when I met both him and Alan Selman (who edited the volume), they were progenitors of the vein within computational complexity that emphasizes the structure of classes of problems. </p>
<p>
I mean “progenitor” quite strongly: When I joined Cornell as a Mathematical Sciences Institute postdoc in 1986, the Computer Science Department generously gave me office space a few doors down from Juris in Upson Hall. I mixed with a gaggle of his students: Lane Hemaspaandra and Jim Kadin and Richard Chang and Desh Ranjan, also saw much of Jin-Yi Cai on his return visits, and had just missed Ming Li and Luc Longpré. We all amplified the energy that Juris brought to the field.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> An Echo in Quantum </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The structural framework needed to be filled with combinatorial power from other areas of mathematical sciences. But to see the framework’s longevity, one need look no further than the Best Paper in the 2022 Computational Complexity Conference and a paper just accepted to FOCS 2022 that was <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-algorithms-conquer-a-new-kind-of-problem-20220711/">featured</a> in <em>Quanta</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
“<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10409">The Acrobatics of BQP</a>” by Scott Aaronson, DeVon Ingram, and William Kretschmer. <p></p>
</li><li>
“<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02063">Verifiable Quantum Advantage Without Structure</a>” by Takashi Yamakawa and Mark Zhandry.
</li></ul>
<p>
Both are on quantum computing, a field that really began to exist about the time that Juris decided that Pankaj Rohatgi would be his last PhD student. The foci are problems involving Fourier transforms and their correlations, error-correcting codes, and the relationship of randomness to entropy that go well beyond what we thought of as “Structure.” Neither paper cites anything by Juris. Yet the former paper’s results are framed as complexity class relations that jump off the page—here are just three square centimeters of the abstract:</p>
<p align="center">
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/07/29/juris-hartmanis-1928-2022/acrobaticssnippet/" rel="attachment wp-att-20268"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/AcrobaticsSnippet.jpg?resize=450%2C115&amp;ssl=1" alt="" height="115" class="aligncenter wp-image-20268" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>
All three results in the latter paper are relative to a random oracle; the first states: “There are NP search problems solvable by BQP machines but not BPP machines.” The expansion of formal machine models from the basic Turing machine, in order to embrace elements of complexity, is the backbone of the paper with Stearns. The relation of machine models to classes in the presence of oracles was the focus of Juris’s ICALP 1986 <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-16761-7_62">paper</a> with Lane, “Complexity Classes Without Machines.” </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Founding Paper </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
My pithiest statement of the 1965 paper’s impact is that it made Turing’s tape-machine formulation <em>durable</em>. Indeed, the notions of streaming algorithms, nearly-linear time efficiency, and data locality being one-dimensional that I recall from the 1990s have more affinity to that paper’s technical development than to the polynomial benchmark of feasibility that yielded the formalizations of P and NP either side of 1970. Here are two machine diagrams from the paper:</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/07/29/juris-hartmanis-1928-2022/hs65tapes/" rel="attachment wp-att-20269"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/HS65tapes.jpg?resize=525%2C289&amp;ssl=1" alt="" height="289" class="aligncenter wp-image-20269" width="525" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
Before giving the second diagram, let me note that their simple question of whether there is any algebraic irrational number that can be computed to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> places in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{O(n)}" class="latex" /> time by this kind of machine, has yet to be answered.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/07/29/juris-hartmanis-1928-2022/hs65tht/" rel="attachment wp-att-20271"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/HS65THT.jpg?resize=525%2C294&amp;ssl=1" alt="" height="294" class="aligncenter wp-image-20271" width="525" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
The latter diagram conveys their proof of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_hierarchy_theorem">Time Hierarchy Theorem</a>—though needing a quadratic separation, as today’s logarithmic-gap formulation needed an improvement the following year by Stearns with Frederick Hennie. That is to say, the paper that defined complexity measures also demonstrated how it is possible to prove lower bounds for them. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> It Could Have Been Lambdas </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Lest you think the machine formulation was inevitable at the start, consider the following <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2015/05/fiftieth-anniversary-of-publication-of.html?showComment=1431672005603#c7849278842572743298">comment</a> from “Mathai”—whom I take to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathai_Joseph">Mathai Joseph</a>—in Lance Fortnow’s 2015 <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2015/05/fiftieth-anniversary-of-publication-of.html">post</a> marking the paper’s 50th anniversary:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “I talked to Hartmanis about this in 2012 and asked if they had considered using recursive function theory. He said they had and it had made things horribly complicated. Then they came across Turing machines and the whole thing became ‘so simple’ !” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
I myself once took part in work trying to re-base complexity on recursion in an alteration of the lambda calculus. So many things have earned the name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_tarpit">Turing tarpits</a>; theirs based squarely on Turing was not.</p>
<p>
Dick Karp, quoted by Stearns in his <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5272">contribution</a> to the 60th birthday volume, captured the paper’s importance:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>[I]t is the 1965 paper by Juris Hartmanis and Richard Stearns that marks the beginning of the modern era of complexity theory. Using the Turing machine as their model of an abstract computer, [they] provided a precise definition of the “complexity class” consisting of all problems solvable in a number of steps bounded by some given function of the input length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />. Adapting the diagonalization technique that Turing had used to prove the undecidability of the Halting Problem, they proved many interesting results about the structure of complexity classes. All of us who read their paper could not fail to realize that we now had a satisfactory formal framework for pursuing the questions that [Jack] Edmonds had raised earlier in an intuitive fashion.</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Dick and I have talked about the importance of good definitions often on this blog, and here is a similar <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/08/what-makes-great-definition.html">post</a> by Lance. In my formative years, I was fortunate to have two texts that wove theirs and the P-NP-based definitions together: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers_and_Intractability">[GJ79]</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Automata_Theory,_Languages,_and_Computation">[HU79]</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Undecidability and Proofs </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
A second vein of Juris’s work made a more particular impression on me, even before I met him. For SWAT (now FOCS) in 1967, he wrote a single-author <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/321495.321507">paper</a>, “On the Complexity of Undecidable Problems in Automata Theory.” The essence is that above a certain level of machine sophistication, whenever you prove the “good news” of lower bounds to separate classes in a hierarchy, you also get the “bad news” of there being problems between the class levels whose status is not resolvable in whatever strong system of logic you employ. </p>
<p>
This raises the question, for classes like P and NP that have not yet been separated, whether the logical independence phenomenon washes over the entire landscape. He and John Hopcroft wrote a short <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1008335.1008336">paper</a> for SIGACT News outlining this possibility. The topic was taken up by others, including Dick with Rich De Millo and later myself, and continues to percolate. </p>
<p>
One of his last papers, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44577-3_17">Computational Complexity and Mathematical Proofs</a>,” takes the opposite avenue of how the structure of computations influences the production of proofs, including interactive proofs. This was based on an earlier paper with Chang, Ranjan, and Rohatgi, which I covered in a 2015 <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2015/05/17/the-shapes-of-computations/">post</a>. This diagram conveys the idea:</p>
<p></p><p><br />

<p>
</p><p></p><h2> A Dinner Before Going to NSF </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
One of my most delightful memories is sitting next to Juris at the conference dinner at the IFIP 1994 congress in Hamburg. Earlier that day I had met the conference honoree, Konrad Zuse, even speaking a little in German with him. We were not seated close to Zuse—indeed, I am not confident to say either way whether he was there. But seated across from us was a woman representing the NSF whom Juris was most interested to talk with.</p>
<p>
The strong memory I have is that I did not commandeer the conversation toward technical problems within structural complexity. Juris was eager to convey command and interest in the breadth of Computer Science, and so was I. We three went further: into music and art and culture quite apart from computers. It was a delightful flow of talk for almost two hours. Juris thanked me afterward for not waxing technical. I did not fully get the picture until Juris <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=101782">joined</a> NSF as Director of CISE two years later, in 1996. </p>
<p>
There is much more I could say about his work promoting the complexity theory community, about being a founding editor of the Springer-Verlag <em>Lecture Notes in Computer Science</em> series, about helping to found Cornell’s computer science department. On the last, his longtime Cornell colleague Anil Nerode has sent me this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “I was chairman of the committee of three, which included Bob Walker, that selected him to chair and organize a new computer science department. He already exhibited the scientific and people skills, and the breadth of vision, for which he was later famous. I will miss him very much.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
One other detail I remember of Juris’s personal life is that he liked sporty cars. I am not among those who rode with him muscularly in one—other drivers have filled that niche for me. We invite readers who have done so—or who wish to give any other personal reminiscences—to contribute below. I’ll leave with the observation that of the two scientists in this photo—</p>

<p>I am pleased to post <a href="http://www.cs.unibo.it/~sangio/" target="_blank">Davide Sangiorgi</a>'s interview with <a href="https://concur2022.mimuw.edu.pl/tot-award/" target="_blank">CONCUR 2022 Test-of-Time Award</a> recipient <a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~leifer/" target="_blank">James Leifer</a>, who will receive the award for the paper <br /><a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-44618-4_19.pdf" target="_blank">"Deriving Bisimulation Congruences for Reactive Systems</a>" co-authored with the late Robin Milner. <br /></p><p>Thanks to James for painting a rich picture of the scientific and social context within which the work on that paper was done and to Davide for conducting the interview. I trust that readers of this blog will enjoy reading it as much as I did. </p><div><b>Davide:</b> How did the work presented in your CONCUR ToT paper come about?</div><div><br /></div><div><b>James:</b> I  was introduced to Robin Milner by my undergraduate advisor Bernard  Sufrin around 1994. Thanks to that meeting, I started with Robin at  Cambridge in 1995 as a fresh Ph.D. student. Robin had recently moved  from Edinburgh and had a wonderful research group, including, at various  times, Peter Sewell, Adriana Compagnoni, Benjamin Pierce, and Philippa  Gardner. There were also many colleagues working or visiting Cambridge  interested in process calculi: Davide Sangiorgi, Andy Gordon, Luca  Cardelli, Martín Abadi,... It was an exciting atmosphere!  I was  particularly close to Peter Sewell, with whom I discussed the ideas here  extensively and who was generous with his guidance.</div><div><br /></div><div>There  was a trend in the community at the time of building complex process  calculi (for encryption, Ambients, etc.) where the free syntax would be  quotiented by a structural congruence to "stir the soup" and allow  different parts of a tree to float together; reaction rules (unlabelled  transitions) then would permit those agglomerated bits to react, to  transform into something new.</div><div><br /></div><div>Robin wanted to  come up with a generalised framework, which he called Action Calculi,  for modelling this style of process calculi.  His framework would  describe graph-like "soups" of atoms linked together by arcs  representing binding and sharing; moreover the atoms could contain  subgraphs inside of them for freezing activity (as in prefixing in the pi-calculus), with the possibility of boundary crossing arcs  (similarly to how nu-bound names in pi-calculus can be used in  deeply nested subterms).  </div><div><br /></div><div>Robin had an amazing  talent for drawing beautiful graphs! He would "move" the nodes around  on the chalkboard and reveal how a subgraph was in fact a reactum (the  LHS of an unlabelled transition).  In the initial phases of my Ph.D. I  just tried to understand these graphs: they were so natural to draw on  the blackboard! And yet, they were also so uncomfortable to use when  written out in linear tree- and list-like syntax, with so many distinct  concrete representations for the same graph.</div><div><br /></div><div>Putting  aside the beauty of these graphs, what was the benefit of this  framework? If one could manage to embed a process calculus in  Action Calculi, using the graph structure and fancy binding and nesting  to represent the quotiented syntax, what then?  We dreamt about a  proposition along the following lines: if you represent your syntax  (quotiented by your structural congruence) in Action Calculi graphs, and  you represent your reaction rules as Action Calculi graph rewrites,  then we will give you a congruential bisimulation for free!</div><div><br /></div><div>Compared  to CCS for example, many of the rich new process calculi lacked  labelled transitions systems. In CCS, there was a clean, simple notion  of labelled transitions and, moreover, bisimulation over those labelled  transitions yielded a congruence: for all processes <i>P</i> and <i>Q</i>, and all  process contexts<i> C[-]</i>, if <i>P ~ Q</i>, then <i>C[P] ~ C[Q]</i>. This is a  key quality for a bisimulation to possess, since it allows modular  reasoning about pieces of a process, something that's so much harder in a  concurrent world than in a sequential one.</div><div><br /></div><div>Returning  to Action Calculi, we set out to make good on the dream that everyone  gets a congruential bisimulation for free! Our idea was to find a  general method to derive labelled transitions systems from the  unlabelled transitions and then to prove that bisimulation built from  those labelled transitions would be a congruence.</div><div><br /></div><div>The  idea was often discussed at that time that there was a duality whereby a  process undergoing a labelled transition could be thought of as the  environment providing a complementary context inducing the process to  react. In the early labelled transition system in pi-calculus for  example, I recall hearing that <i>P</i> undergoing the input labelled  transition <i>xy</i> could be thought of as the environment outputting  payload<i> y </i>on channel <i>x</i> to enable a tau transition with <i>P.</i></div><div><br /></div><div>So  I tried to formalise this notion that labelled transitions are  environmental contexts enabling reaction, i.e. defining <i>P ---C[-]---&gt; P'</i> to mean <i>C[P] ------&gt; P'</i> provided that <i>C[-]</i> was somehow "minimal", i.e. contained nothing superfluous beyond  what was necessary to trigger the reaction. We wanted to get a rigorous  definition of that intuitive idea. There was a long and difficult period  (about 12 months) wandering through the weeds trying to define minimal  contexts for Action Calculi graphs (in terms of minimal nodes and  minimal arcs), but it was hugely complex, frustrating, and ugly and we  seemed no closer to the original goal of achieving congruential  bisimulation with these labelled transitions systems.</div><div><br /></div><div>Eventually  I stepped back from Action Calculi and started to work on a more  theoretical definition of "minimal context" and we took inspiration from  category theory.  Robin had always viewed Action Calculi graphs as  categorical arrows between objects (where the objects represented  interfaces for plugging together arcs). At the time, there was much  discussion of category theory in the air (for game theory); I certainly  didn't understand most of it but found it interesting and inspiring. </div><div><br /></div><div>If  we imagine that processes and process-contexts are just categorical  arrows (where the objects are arities) then context composition is arrow  composition. Now, assuming we have a reaction rule <i>R ------&gt; R'</i>,  we can define labelled transitions <i>P ---C[-]---&gt; P'</i> as follows:  there exists a context <i>D</i> such that <i>C[P] = D[R] </i>and <i>P' = D[R']</i>.  The first equality is a commuting diagram and Robin and I thought that  we could formalise minimality by something like a categorical pushout!  But that wasn't quite right as <i>C </i>and <i>D</i> are not <i>the minimum </i>pair (compared to all other candidates), but <i>a minimal</i> pair:  there may be many incomparable minimal pairs all of which are witnesses  of legitimate labelled transitions.  There was again a long period of  frustration eventually resolved when I reinvented "relative pushouts"  (in place of pushouts). They are a simple notion in slice categories but  I didn't know that until later...</div><div><br /></div><div>Having found  a reasonable definition of "minimal", I worked excitedly on  bisimulation, trying to get a proof of congruence: <i>P ~ Q</i> implies <i>E[P] ~ E[Q]</i>. For weeks, I was considering the labelled transitions  of <i>E[P] ---F[-]---&gt;</i> and all the ways that could arise. The most  interesting case is when a part of <i>P,</i> a part of <i>E</i>, and <i>F</i> all  "conspire" together to generate a reaction. From that I was able to  derive a labelled transition of <i>P</i> by manipulating relative pushouts,  which by hypothesis yielded a labelled transition of <i>Q</i>, and then, via a  sort of "pushout pasting", a labelled transition <i>E[Q] ---F[-]---&gt;</i>. It was a wonderful moment of elation when I pasted  all the diagrams together on Robin's board and we realised that we had  the congruence property for our synthesised labels!</div><div><br /></div><div>We  looked back again at Action Calculi, using the notion of relative  pushouts to guide us (instead of the arbitrary approach we had  considered before) and we further looked at other kinds of process  calculi syntax to see how relative pushouts could work there...   Returning to the original motivation to make Action Calculi a universal  framework with congruential bisimulation for free, I'm not convinced of  its utility. But it was the challenge that led us to the journey of the  relative pushout work, which I think is beautiful.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Davide: </b>What influence did this work have in the rest of your career? How much of your subsequent work built on it?</div><div><b><br /></b></div><div><b>James:</b> It  was thanks to this work that I visited INRIA Rocquencourt to discuss  process calculi with Jean-Jacques Lévy and Georges Gonthier. They kindly  invited me to spend a year as postdoc in 2001 after I finished my  thesis with Robin, and I ended up staying in INRIA ever since. I didn't  work on bisimulation again as a research topic, but stayed interested in  concurrency and distribution for a long time, working with Peter Sewell  et al on distributed language design with module migration and  rebinding, and with Cédric Fournet et al on compiler design for  automatically synthesising cryptographic protocols for high level  sessions specifications.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Davide: </b>Could you tell  us about your interactions with Robin Milner? What was it like to work  with him? What lessons did you learn from him?</div><div><br /></div><div><b>James: </b>I was tremendously inspired by Robin.</div><div><br /></div><div>He  would stand at his huge blackboard, his large hands covered in chalk,  his bicycle clips glinting on his trousers, and he would stalk up and  down the blackboard --- thinking and moving.  There was something  theatrical and artistic about it: his thinking was done in physical  movement and his drawings were dynamic as the representations of his  ideas evolved across the board.</div><div><br /></div><div>I loved his  drawings. They would start simple, a circle for a node, a box for a  subgraph, etc. and then develop more and more detail corresponding to  his intuition.

<p>I promise you: this post is going to tell a scientifically coherent story that involves <em>all five topics </em>listed in the title.  Not one can be omitted.</p>



<p>My story starts with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CpzigpEJnU">Zoom talk</a> that the one and only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Susskind">Lenny Susskind</a> delivered for the Simons Institute for Theory of Computing back in May.  There followed a panel discussion involving Lenny, Edward Witten, Geoffrey Penington, Umesh Vazirani, and your humble shtetlmaster.</p>



<p>Lenny’s talk led up to a gedankenexperiment involving an observer, Alice, who bravely jumps into a specially-prepared black hole, in order to see the answer to a certain computational problem in her final seconds before being ripped to shreds near the singularity.  Drawing on earlier work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14646">Bouland, Fefferman, and Vazirani</a>, Lenny speculated that the computational problem could be exponentially hard even for a (standard) quantum computer.  Despite this, Lenny repeatedly insisted—indeed, he asked me again to stress here—that he was <em>not</em> claiming to violate the <a href="https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/6088/what-precisely-is-the-quantum-extended-church-turing-thesis">Quantum Extended Church-Turing Thesis</a> (QECTT), the statement that all of nature can be efficiently simulated by a standard quantum computer.  Instead, he was simply investigating how the QECTT needs to be <em>formulated</em> in order to be a true statement.</p>



<p>I didn’t understand this, to put it mildly.  If what Lenny was saying was right—i.e., if the infalling observer could see the answer to a computational problem not in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BQP">BQP</a>, or Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial-Time—then why <em>shouldn’t</em> we call that a violation of the QECTT?  Just like we call Shor’s quantum factoring algorithm a likely violation of the <em>classical</em> Extended Church-Turing Thesis, the thesis saying that nature can be efficiently simulated by a classical computer?  Granted, you don’t have to <em>die</em> in order to run Shor’s algorithm, as you do to run Lenny’s experiment.  But why should such implementation details matter from the lofty heights of computational complexity?</p>



<p>Alas, not only did Lenny never answer that in a way that made sense to me, he kept trying to shift the focus from real, physical black holes to “silicon spheres” made of qubits, which would be programmed to <em>simulate</em> the process of Alice jumping into the black hole (in a dual boundary description).  Say what?  Granting that Lenny’s silicon spheres, being quantum computers under another name, could clearly be simulated in BQP, wouldn’t this still leave the question about the computational powers of observers who jump into <em>actual</em> black holes—i.e., the question that we presumably cared about in the first place?</p>



<p>Confusing me even further, Witten seemed almost dismissive of the idea that Lenny’s gedankenexperiment raised any new issue for the QECTT—that is, any issue that wouldn’t already have been present in a universe without gravity.  But as to Witten’s reasons, the most I understood from his remarks was that he was worried about various “engineering” issues with implementing Lenny’s gedankenexperiment, involving gravitational backreaction and the like.  Ed Witten, now suddenly the practical guy!  I couldn’t even isolate the crux of disagreement between Susskind and Witten, since after all, they <em>agreed</em> (bizarrely, from my perspective) that the QECTT wasn’t violated.  Why wasn’t it?</p>



<p>Anyway, shortly afterward I <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6457">attended the 28th Solvay Conference in Brussels</a>, where one of the central benefits I got—besides seeing friends after a long COVID absence and eating some amazing chocolate mousse—was a <em>dramatically</em> clearer understanding of the issues in Lenny’s gedankenexperiment.  I owe this improved understanding to conversations with many people at Solvay, but above all Daniel Gottesman and Daniel Harlow.  Lenny himself wasn’t there, other than in spirit, but I ran the Daniels’ picture by him afterwards and he assented to all of its essentials.</p>



<p>The Daniels’ picture is what I want to explain in this post.  Needless to say, I take sole responsibility for any errors in my presentation, as I <em>also</em> take sole responsibility for not understanding (or rather: not doing the work to translate into terms that I understood) what Susskind and Witten had said to me before.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>The first thing you need to understand about Lenny’s gedankenexperiment is that it takes place entirely in the context of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdS/CFT_correspondence">AdS/CFT</a>: the famous holographic duality between two types of physical theories that look wildly different.  Here AdS stands for <em>anti-de-Sitter</em>: a quantum theory of gravity describing a D-dimensional universe with a negative cosmological constant (i.e. hyperbolic geometry), one where black holes can form and evaporate and so forth.  Meanwhile, CFT stands for <em>conformal field theory</em>: a quantum field theory, with no apparent gravity (and hence no black holes), that lives on the (D-1)-dimensional boundary of the D-dimensional AdS space.  The staggering claim of AdS/CFT is that every physical question about the AdS bulk can be translated into an equivalent question about the CFT boundary, and vice versa, with a one-to-one mapping from states to states and observables to observables.  So in that sense, they’re actually the <em>same</em> theory, just viewed in two radically different ways.  AdS/CFT originally came out of string theory, but then <a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=12981">notoriously</a> “swallowed its parent,” to the point where nowadays, if you go to what are still called “string theory” meetings, you’re liable to hear <em>vastly</em> more discussion of AdS/CFT than of actual strings.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the story I want to tell won’t depend on fine details of how AdS/CFT works.  Nevertheless, <em>you can’t just ignore the AdS/CFT part</em> as some technicality, in order to get on with the vivid tale of Alice jumping into a black hole, hoping to learn the answer to a beyond-BQP computational problem in her final seconds of existence.  The reason you can’t ignore it is that the whole beyond-BQP computational problem we’ll be talking about, involves the <em>translation</em> (or “dictionary”) between the AdS bulk and the CFT boundary.  If you like, then, it’s actually the chasm between bulk and boundary that plays the starring role in this story.  The more familiar chasm <em>within</em> the bulk, between the interior of a black hole and its exterior (the two separated by an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon">event horizon</a>), plays only a subsidiary role: that of causing the AdS/CFT dictionary to become exponentially complex, as far as anyone can tell.</p>



<p>Pause for a minute.  Previously I led you to believe that we’d be talking about an actual observer Alice, jumping into an actual physical black hole, and whether Alice could see the answer to a problem that’s intractable even for quantum computers in her last moments before hitting the singularity, and if so whether we should take that to refute the Quantum Extended Church-Turing Thesis.  What I’m saying now is so wildly at variance with that picture, that it had to be repeated to me about 10 times before I understood it.  Once I did understand, I then had to repeat it to <em>others</em> about 10 times before <em>they</em> understood.  And I don’t care if people ridicule me for that admission—how slow Scott and his friends must be, compared to string theorists!—because my only goal right now is to get <em>you</em> to understand it.</p>



<p>To say it again: Lenny has <em>not</em> proposed a way for Alice to surpass the complexity-theoretic power of quantum computers, even for a brief moment, by crossing the event horizon of a black hole.  If <em>that</em> was Alice’s goal when she jumped into the black hole, then alas, she probably sacrificed her life for nothing!  As far as anyone knows, Alice’s experiences, even after crossing the event horizon, ought to continue to be described extremely well by general relativity and quantum field theory (at least until she nears the singularity and dies), and therefore ought to be simulatable in BQP.  Granted, we don’t actually <em>know</em> this—you can call it an open problem if you like—but it seems like a reasonable guess.</p>



<p>In that case, though, what beyond-BQP problem was Lenny talking about, and what does it have to do with black holes?  Building on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14646">Bouland-Fefferman-Vazirani paper</a>, Lenny was interested in a class of problems of the following form: Alice is given as input a pure quantum state |ψ⟩, which encodes a boundary CFT state, which is dual to an AdS bulk universe that contains a black hole.  Alice’s goal is, by examining |ψ⟩, to learn something about what’s <em>inside</em> the black hole.  For example: does the black hole interior contain “shockwaves,” and if so how many and what kind?  Does it contain a wormhole, connecting it to a different black hole in another universe?  If so, what’s the volume of that wormhole?  (Not the first question <em>I</em> would ask either, but bear with me.)</p>



<p>Now, when I say Alice is “given” the state |ψ⟩, this could mean several things: she could just be physically given a collection of <em>n</em> qubits.  Or, she could be given a gigantic table of 2<sup><em>n</em></sup> amplitudes.  Or, as a third possibility, she could be given a description of a quantum circuit that prepares |ψ⟩, say from the all-0 initial state |0<sup><em>n</em></sup>⟩.  Each of these possibilities leads to a different complexity-theoretic picture, and the differences are extremely interesting to <em>me</em>, so that’s what I mostly focused on in my remarks in the panel discussion after Lenny’s talk.  But it won’t matter much for the story I want to tell in this post.</p>



<p>However |ψ⟩ is given to Alice, the prediction of AdS/CFT is that |ψ⟩ encodes everything there is to know about the AdS bulk, <em>including</em> whatever is inside the black hole—but, and this is crucial, the information about what’s inside the black hole will be <em>pseudorandomly scrambled</em>.  In other words, it works like this: whatever simple thing you’d like to know about parts of the bulk that <em>aren’t</em> hidden behind event horizons—is there a star over here? some gravitational lensing over there? etc.—it seems that you could not only learn it by measuring |ψ⟩, but learn it <em>in polynomial time</em>, the dictionary between bulk and boundary being computationally efficient in that case.  (As with almost everything else in this subject, even <em>that</em> hasn’t been rigorously proven, though my postdoc Jason Pollack and I made <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/discretebulk.pdf">some progress</a> this past spring by proving a piece of it.)  On the other hand, as soon as you want to know what’s <em>inside</em> an event horizon, the fact that there are no probes that an “observer at infinity” could apply to find out, seems to translate into the requisite measurements on |ψ⟩ being exponentially complex to apply.  (Technically, you’d have to measure an ensemble of poly(<em>n</em>) identical copies of |ψ⟩, but I’ll ignore that in what follows.)</p>



<p>In more detail, the relevant part of |ψ⟩ turns into a pseudorandom, scrambled mess: a mess that it’s plausible that no polynomial-size quantum circuit could even distinguish from the maximally mixed state.  So, while in principle the information is all there in |ψ⟩, getting it out seems as hard as various well-known problems in symmetric-key cryptography, if not literally NP-hard.  This is <em>way</em> beyond what we expect even a quantum computer to be able to do efficiently: indeed, after 30 years of quantum algorithms research, the best quantum speedup we know for this sort of task is typically just the quadratic speedup from Grover’s algorithm.</p>



<p>So now you understand why there was some hope that Alice, by jumping into a black hole, could solve a problem that’s exponentially hard for quantum computers!  Namely because, once she’s inside the black hole, she can just<em> see</em> the shockwaves, or the volume of the wormhole, or whatever, and no longer faces the exponentially hard task of decoding that information from |ψ⟩.  It’s as if the black hole has <em>solved the problem for her</em>, by physically instantiating the otherwise exponentially complex transformation between the bulk and boundary descriptions of |ψ⟩.</p>



<p>Having now gotten your hopes up, the next step in the story is to destroy them.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Here’s the fundamental problem: |ψ⟩ does <em>not</em> represent the CFT dual of a bulk universe that contains the black hole with the shockwaves or whatever, <em>and that also contains Alice herself, floating outside the black hole, and being given |ψ⟩ as an input.</em>  Indeed, it’s unclear what the latter state would even mean: how do we get around the circularity in its definition?  How do we avoid an infinite regress, where |ψ⟩ would have to encode a copy of |ψ⟩ which would have to encode a copy of … and so on forever?  Furthermore, who created this |ψ⟩ to give to Alice?  We don’t normally imagine that an “input state” contains a complete description of the body and brain of the person whose job it is to learn the output.</p>



<p>By contrast, a scenario that we <em>can</em> define without circularity is this: Alice is given (via physical qubits, a giant table of amplitudes, an obfuscated quantum circuit, or whatever) a pure quantum state |ψ⟩, which represents the CFT dual of a hypothetical universe containing a black hole.  Alice wants to learn what shockwaves or wormholes are inside the black hole, a problem plausibly conjectured not to have any ordinary polynomial-size quantum circuit that takes copies of |ψ⟩ as input.  To “solve” the problem, Alice sets into motion the following sequence of events:</p>



<ol><li>Alice scans and uploads her own brain into a quantum computer, presumably destroying the original meat brain in the process!  The QC represents Alice, who now exists only virtually, via a state |φ⟩.</li><li>The QC performs entangling operations on |φ⟩ and |ψ⟩, which correspond to inserting Alice into the bulk of the universe described by |ψ⟩, and then having her fall into the black hole.</li><li>Now in simulated form, “Alice” (or so we assume, depending on our philosophical position) has the subjective experience of falling into the black hole and observing what’s inside.  <em>Success!</em>  Given |ψ⟩ as input, we’ve now caused “Alice” (for some definition of “Alice”) to have observed the answer to the beyond-BQP computational problem.</li></ol>



<p>In the panel discussion, I now model Susskind as having proposed scenario 1-3, Witten as going along with 1-2 but rejecting 3 or not wanting to discuss it, and me as having made valid points about the computational complexity of simulating Alice’s experience in 1-3, yet while being radically mistaken about what the scenario <em>was</em> (I still thought an actual black hole was involved).</p>



<p>An obvious question is whether, having learned the answer, “Alice” can now get the answer back out to the “real, original” world.  Alas, the expectation is that this would require exponential time.  Why?  Because otherwise, this whole process would’ve constituted a subexponential-time algorithm for distinguishing random from pseudorandom states using an “ordinary” quantum computer!  Which is conjectured not to exist.</p>



<p>And what about Alice herself?  In polynomial time, could she return from “the Matrix,” back to a real-world biological body?  Sure she could, in principle—if, for example, the entire quantum computation were run in reverse.  But notice that reversing the computation would <em>also</em> make Alice forget the answer to the problem!  Which is not at all a coincidence: if the problem is outside BQP, then in general, Alice can know the answer <em>only</em> while she’s “inside the Matrix.”</p>



<p>Now that hopefully everything is crystal-clear and we’re all on the same page, what can we say about this scenario?  In particular: <em>should</em> it cause us to reject or modify the QECTT itself?</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Daniel Gottesman, I thought, offered a brilliant reductio ad absurdum of the view that the simulated black hole scenario should count as a refutation of the QECTT.  Well, he didn’t <em>call</em> it a “reductio,” but I will.</p>



<p>For the reductio, let’s forget not only about quantum gravity but even about quantum mechanics itself, and go all the way back to classical computer science.  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">fully homomorphic encryption scheme</a>, the <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/craig/craig-thesis.pdf">first example</a> of which was discovered by Craig Gentry 15 years ago, lets you do arbitrary computations on encrypted data without ever needing to decrypt it.  It has both an encryption key, for encrypting the original plaintext data, and a separate decryption key, for decrypting the final answer.</p>



<p>Now suppose Alice has some homomorphically encrypted top-secret emails, which she’d like to read.  She has the encryption key (which is public), but not the decryption key.</p>



<p><em>If</em> the homomorphic encryption scheme is secure against quantum computers—as the schemes discovered by Gentry and later researchers currently appear to be—and <em>if</em> the QECTT is true, then Alice’s goal is obviously infeasible: decrypting the data will take her exponential time.</p>



<p>Now, however, a classical version of Lenny comes along, and explains to Alice that she simply needs to do the following:</p>



<ol><li>Upload her own brain state into a classical computer, destroying the “meat” version in the process (who needed it?).</li><li>Using the known encryption key, homomorphically encrypt a computer program that simulates (and thereby, we presume, <em>enacts</em>) Alice’s consciousness.</li><li>Using the homomorphically encrypted Alice-brain, <em>together with</em> the homomorphically encrypted input data, do the homomorphic computations that simulate the process of Alice’s brain reading the top-secret emails.</li></ol>



<p>The claim would now be that, <em>inside the homomorphic encryption</em>, the simulated Alice has the subjective experience of reading the emails in the clear.  Aha, therefore she “broke” the homomorphic encryption scheme!  Therefore, assuming that the scheme was secure even against quantum computers, the QECTT must be false!</p>



<p>According to Gottesman, this is almost perfectly analogous to Lenny’s black hole scenario.  In particular, they share the property that “encryption is easy but decryption is hard.”   Once she’s uploaded her brain, Alice can efficiently <em>enter</em> the homomorphically encrypted world to see the solution to a hard problem, just like she can efficiently <em>enter</em> the black hole world to do the same.  In both cases, however, getting <em>back</em> to her normal world with the answer would then take Alice exponential time.  Note that in the latter case, the difficulty is <em>not</em> so much about “escaping from a black hole,” as it is about inverting the AdS/CFT dictionary.</p>



<p>Going further, we can regard the AdS/CFT dictionary for regions behind event horizons as, itself, an <em>example</em> of a fully homomorphic encryption scheme—in this case, of course, one where the ciphertexts are quantum states.  This strikes me as potentially an important insight about AdS/CFT itself, even if that wasn’t Gottesman’s intention.  It complements many other recent connections between AdS/CFT and theoretical computer science, including the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7041">view of AdS/CFT as a quantum error-correcting code</a>, and the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.00354">connection between AdS/CFT and the Max-Flow/Min-Cut Theorem</a> (see also my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/discretebulk.pdf">talk</a> about my work with Jason Pollack).</p>



<p>So where’s the reductio?  Well, when it’s put so starkly, I suspect that not many would regard Gottesman’s classical homomorphic encryption scenario as a “real” challenge to the QECTT.  Or rather, people might say: yes, this raises fascinating questions for the philosophy of mind, but at any rate, we’re no longer talking about <em>physics</em>.  Unlike with (say) quantum computing, no new <em>physical</em> phenomenon is being brought to light that lets an otherwise intractable computational problem be solved.  Instead, it’s all about the <em>user herself</em>, about Alice, and which physical systems get to count as instantiating her.</p>



<p>It’s like, imagine Alice at the computer store, weighing which laptop to buy.  Besides weight, battery life, and price, she definitely does care about processing power.  She might even consider a quantum computer, if one is available.  Maybe even a computer with a black hole, wormhole, or closed timelike curve inside: as long as it gives the answers she wants, what does she care about the innards?  But a computer whose normal functioning would (pessimistically) kill her or (optimistically) radically change her own nature, trapping her in a simulated universe that she can escape only by forgetting the computer’s output?  Yeah, I don’t envy the computer salesman.</p>



<p>Anyway, if we’re going to say this about the homomorphic encryption scenario, then shouldn’t we say the same about the simulated black hole scenario?  Again, from an “external” perspective, all that’s happening is a giant BQP computation.  Anything beyond BQP that we consider to be happening, depends on adopting the standpoint of an observer who “jumps into the homomorphic encryption on the CFT boundary”—at which point, it would seem, we’re no longer talking about physics but about philosophy of mind.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>So, that was the story!  I promised you that it would integrally involve black holes, holography, the Quantum Extended Church-Turing Thesis, fully homomorphic encryption, <em>and</em> brain uploading, and I hope to have delivered on my promise.</p>



<p>Of course, while this blog post has forever cleared up all philosophical confusions about AdS/CFT and the Quantum Extended Church-Turing Thesis, many questions of a more technical nature remain.  For example: what about the original scenario?  <em>can</em> we argue that the experiences of bulk observers can be simulated in BQP, even when those observers jump into black holes?  Also, what can we say about the complexity class of problems to which the simulated Alice can learn the answers?  Could she even solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time this way, or at least invert one-way functions?  More broadly, what’s the power of “BQP with an oracle for applying the AdS/CFT dictionary”—once or multiple times, in one direction or both directions?</p>



<p>Lenny himself described his gedankenexperiment as exploring the power of a new complexity class that he called “JI/poly,” where the JI stands for “Jumping In” (to a black hole, that is).  The nomenclature is transparently ridiculous—“/poly” means “with polynomial-size advice,” which we’re <em>not</em> talking about here—and I’ve argued in this post that the “JI” is rather misleading as well.  If Alice is “jumping” anywhere, it’s not into a black hole <em>per se</em>, but into a quantum computer that simulates a CFT that’s dual to a bulk universe containing a black hole.</p>



<p>In a broader sense, though, to contemplate these questions at all is clearly to “jump in” to … <em>something</em>.  It’s old hat by now that one can start in physics and end up in philosophy: what else is the quantum measurement problem, or the Boltzmann brain problem, or anthropic cosmological puzzles like whether (all else equal) we’re a hundred times as likely to find ourselves in a universe with a hundred times as many observers?  More recently, it’s also become commonplace that one can start in physics and end in computational complexity theory: quantum computing itself is the example par excellence, but over the past decade, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4504">Harlow-Hayden argument</a> about decoding Hawking radiation and the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07876">complexity = action proposal</a> have made clear that it can happen even in quantum gravity.</p>



<p>Lenny’s new gedankenexperiment, however, is the first case I’ve seen where you start out in physics, and end up embroiled in some of the hardest questions of philosophy of mind and computational complexity theory <em>simultaneously</em>.</p></div>

<p>Some three-dimensional convex polyhedra have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsphere">midsphere</a>, a sphere tangent to all of their edges. More strongly, every three-dimensional convex polyhedron has a combinatorially equivalent form, called a “canonical polyhedron”, that has a midsphere. The literature on midspheres is a little sparse and missing some key facts and counterexamples, so I thought I would collect some of them here.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2017/midsphere.png" alt="A canonical polyhedron and its midsphere" /></p>

<p>The midsphere, when it exists, has a center equidistant from all the edges, and all of the lines through edges. The set of points equidistant from two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew_lines">skew lines</a> is a curved surface, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraboloid">hyperbolic paraboloid</a>, but when two lines cross each other the set of points equidistant from both lines is instead the union of two planes, perpendicular to each other and to the plane of the crossing lines, through the crossing point of the two lines. For the midsphere of a polyhedron, and two edges incident on a face of the polyhedron, only one of these two planes is relevant, the one that bisects the interior angle of the face. The center of the midsphere (if it exists) can be found at the point where all of these face-angle-bisecting planes meet.</p>

<p>A convenient class of examples of polyhedra with midspheres is given by “Crelle’s tetrahedra”, the tetrahedra with midspheres. For every such tetrahedron, one can find four spheres, centered at the tetrahedron vertices, tangent in pairs at the points where the midsphere touches the edges. The tetrahedron’s six edge lengths are sums of radii of two of these four spheres. Conversely, for every four pairwise-externally-tangent spheres whose centers are not coplanar, the convex hull of the centers is one of Crelle’s tetrahedra. The radii of the four spheres can be varied continuously, keeping them in contact, although not every quadruple of radii works: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Menger_determinant">Cayley–Menger determinant</a> of the six sums of pairs of radii must be positive. For instance, if three radii are equal and the fourth is much smaller, the three large spheres will be too far apart for the fourth sphere to touch all three of them and the determinant will be negative. Because Crelle’s tetrahedra can be parameterized by four radii, they form a four-dimensional subspace of the six-dimensional space of all tetrahedra (as parameterized by edge lengths).</p>

<p>Some sources either state that the midsphere touches the polyhedron edges at their midpoints, or define a midsphere to be a sphere through all the edge midpoints. But even when a polyhedron has both a midsphere and a sphere through all of its edge midpoints, these two spheres might not be the same as each other. An example is given by the right pyramids over equilateral triangles, parameterized by the quadruples of radii \((1,1,1,x)\) for \(x\ne 1\). These pyramids have an equilateral-triangle base, which both spheres touch at the edge midpoints. But the three edges of length \(1+x\) meeting at the apex of the pyramid are touched by the midsphere at unit distance from the base, rather than at their midpoints.</p>

<p>Anthony Pugh’s 1976 book <em>Polyhedra: A Visual Approach</em> <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=IDDxpYQTR7kC&amp;pg=PA4">claims that only the Platonic solids have all three of an insphere, midsphere, and circumsphere</a>, but this is not true. Crelle’s tetrahedra are counterexamples. Even with the midpoint-based alternative definition of midspheres, the pyramids are counterexamples.</p>

<p>For a long time the Wikipedia article on midspheres stated that the midsphere gets its name from being between the insphere and circumsphere. But it is not always between them. For a very tall pyramid (with large \(x\)), the circumsphere passes very close to the plane of the equilateral triangle at the base of the pyramid, and the midsphere pokes out past the circumsphere below the base. I briefly thought that the midsphere might be the same as the smallest sphere that touches or contains all of the edges of a polyhedron. In general, even when a midsphere does not exist, this smallest sphere can be found in linear time, as an instance of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CG/0412046">quasiconvex programming</a>. But for very flat pyramids (\(x\) close to its minimum value), the smallest touching sphere has the incircle of the base as its equator, while the midsphere is larger. The same flat pyramids have an insphere that touches their isosceles-triangle faces at points close to the apex of the pyramid, outside the midsphere, so their insphere pokes out of the midsphere.</p>

<p>For most polyhedra having an insphere and a midsphere, or a midsphere and a circumsphere, these spheres are not concentric. They are concentric for symmetric polyhedra, such as the Platonic solids, but those are not the only cases. For instance, when a polyhedron with concentric midsphere and circumsphere, like a regular icosahedron, is sliced by the plane through a cycle of its edges, the result continues to have the same concentric midsphere and circumsphere. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabidiminished_icosahedron">metabidiminished icosahedron</a> below is an example. The polar dual of a polyhedron with concentric midsphere and circumsphere instead has concentric insphere and midsphere.</p>

<p>It may possibly be the case that the inradius is always less than the midradius (when both exist) and that the midradius is always less than the circumradius (when both exist). I don’t have a proof, but I also don’t have a counterexample.</p>

Given a function $f:\mathbb F_2^n \to [-1,1]$, this work seeks to find a large affine subspace $\mathcal U$ such that $f$, when restricted to $\mathcal U$, has small nontrivial Fourier coefficients.

We show that for any function $f:\mathbb F_2^n \to [-1,1]$ with Fourier degree $d$, there exists an affine subspace of dimension at least $ \tilde\Omega(n^{1/d!}k^{-2})$, wherein all of $f$'s nontrivial Fourier coefficients become smaller than $ 2^{-k}$. 
To complement this result, we show the existence of degree $d$ functions with coefficients larger than $2^{-d\log n}$ when restricted to any affine subspace of dimension larger than $\Omega(dn^{1/(d-1)})$. In addition, we give explicit examples of functions with analogous but weaker properties.

Along the way, we provide multiple characterizations of the Fourier coefficients of functions restricted to subspaces of $\mathbb F_2^n$ that may be useful in other contexts. Finally, we highlight applications and connections of our results to parity kill number and affine dispersers/extractors.</div>

<div class="content">
We consider the question of hardness self-amplification: Given a Boolean function $f$ that is hard to compute on a $o(1)$-fraction of inputs drawn from some distribution, can we prove that $f$ is hard to compute on a $(\frac{1}{2} - o(1))$-fraction of inputs drawn from the same distribution? We prove hardness self-amplification results for natural distributional problems studied in fine-grained average-case complexity, such as the problem of counting the number of the triangles modulo 2 in a random tripartite graph and the online vector-matrix-vector multiplication problem over $\mathbb{F}_2$. More generally, we show that any problem that can be decomposed into ``computationally disjoint'' subsets of inputs admits hardness self-amplification. This is proved by generalizing the security proof of the Nisan--Wigderson pseudorandom generator, in which case nearly disjoint subsets of inputs are considered.
    
At the core of our proof techniques is a new notion of feasible hard-core set, which generalizes Impagliazzo's hard-core set [Impagliazzo, FOCS'95]. We show that any weak average-case hard function $f$ has a feasible hard-core set $H$: any small $H$-oracle circuit (that is allowed to make queries $q$ to $H$ if $f(q)$ can be computed without the oracle) fails to compute $f$ on a $(\frac{1}{2} - o(1))$-fraction of inputs in $H$.</div>

<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>Several people have complained that <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> has become too focused on the niche topic of “people being mean to Scott Aaronson on the Internet.”  In one sense, this criticism is deeply unfair—did I <em>decide</em> that a shockingly motivated and sophisticated troll should attack me all week, in many cases impersonating fellow academics to do so?  Has such a thing happened to <em>you</em>?  Did I <em>choose</em> a personality that forces me to respond when it happens?</p>



<p>In another sense, the criticism is of course completely, 100% justified.  That’s why I’m happy and grateful to have formed the <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6576">SOCG (Shtetl-Optimized Committee of Guardians)</a>, whose purpose is to prevent a recurrence, thereby letting me get back to your regularly scheduled programming.</p>



<p>On that note, I hope the complainers will be satisfied with more exclusive-to-<em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> content from one of the world’s greatest living public intellectuals: the Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology at Harvard University, Steven Pinker.</p>



<p>Last month, you’ll recall, Steve and I <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6524">debated the implications of scaling AI models</a> such as GPT-3 and DALL-E.  A main crux of disagreement turned out to be whether there’s any coherent concept of “superintelligence.”  I gave a qualified “yes” (I can’t provide <em>necessary and sufficient conditions</em> for it, nor do I know <em>when</em> AI will achieve it if ever, but there are certainly things an AI could do that would cause me to say it <em>was</em> achieved).  Steve, by contrast, gave a strong “no.”</p>



<p>My friend (and previous <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> guest blogger) Sarah Constantin then wrote a <a href="https://sarahconstantin.substack.com/p/is-human-intelligence-simple-part-75c">thoughtful response to Steve</a>, taking a different tack than I had.  Sarah emphasized that Steve himself is on record defending the statistical validity of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)">Spearman’s <em>g</em></a>: the “general factor of human intelligence,” which accounts for a large fraction of the variation in humans’ performance across nearly every intelligence test ever devised, and which is <em>also</em> found to correlate with cortical thickness and other physiological traits.  Is it so unreasonable, then, to suppose that <em>g</em> is measuring <em>something</em> of abstract significance, such that it would continue to make sense when extrapolated, not to godlike infinity, but at any rate, well beyond the maximum that happens to have been seen in humans?</p>



<p>I relayed Sarah’s question to Steve.  (As it happens, the same question was also discussed at length in, e.g., <a href="https://www.vetta.org/documents/Machine_Super_Intelligence.pdf">Shane Legg’s 2008 PhD thesis</a>; Legg then went on to cofound <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind">DeepMind</a>.)  Steve was then gracious enough to write the following answer, and to give me permission to post it here.  I’ll also share my reply to him.  There’s some further back-and-forth between me and Steve that I’ll save for the comments section to kick things off there.  Everyone is warmly welcomed to join: just remember to stay on topic, be respectful, and <strong>click the link in your verification email!</strong></p>

<h2>Comments on General, Artificial, and Super-Intelligence</h2>



<p><em>by Steven Pinker</em></p>



<p>While I defend the existence and utility of IQ and its principal component, general intelligence or <em>g</em>,  in the study of individual differences, I think it’s completely irrelevant to AI, AI scaling, and AI safety. It’s a measure of differences among humans within the restricted range they occupy, developed more than a century ago. It’s a statistical construct with no theoretical foundation, and it has tenuous connections to any mechanistic understanding of cognition other than as an omnibus measure of processing efficiency (speed of neural transmission, amount of neural tissue, and so on). It exists as a coherent variable only because performance scores on subtests like vocabulary, digit string memorization, and factual knowledge intercorrelate, yielding a statistical principal component, probably a global measure of neural fitness.</p>



<p>In that regard, it’s like a <em>Consumer Reports </em>global rating of cars, or overall score in the pentathlon. It would not be surprising that a car with a more powerful engine also had a better suspension and sound system, or that better swimmers are also, on average, better fencers and shooters. But this tells us precisely nothing about how engines or human bodies work. And imagining an extrapolation to a supervehicle or a superathlete is an exercise in fantasy but not a means to develop new technologies.</p>



<p>Indeed, if “superintelligence” consists of sky-high IQ scores, it’s been here since the 1970s! A few lines of code could recall digit strings or match digits to symbols orders of magnitude better than any human, and old-fashioned AI programs could also trounce us in multiple-choice vocabulary tests, geometric shape extrapolation (“progressive matrices”), analogies, and other IQ test components. None of this will help drive autonomous vehicles, discover cures for cancer, and so on.</p>



<p>As for recent breakthroughs in AI which may or may not surpass humans (the original prompt for this exchange); What is the IQ of GPT-3, or DALL-E, or AlphaGo? The question makes no sense!</p>



<p>So, to answer your question: yes, general intelligence in the psychometrician’s sense is not something that can be usefully extrapolated. And it’s “one-dimensional” only in the sense that a single statistical principal component can always be extracted from a set of intercorrelated variables.</p>



<p>One more point relevant to the general drift of the comments. My statement that “superintelligence” is incoherent is not a semantic quibble that the word is meaningless, and it’s not a pre-emptive strategy of Moving the True Scottish Goalposts. Sure, you could <em>define</em> “superintelligence,” just as you can define “miracle” or “perpetual motion machine” or “square circle.” And you could even recognize it if you ever saw it. But that does not make it coherent in the sense of being physically realizable.</p>



<p>If you’ll forgive me one more analogy, I think “superintelligence” is like “superpower.” Anyone can define “superpower” as “flight, superhuman strength, X-ray vision, heat vision, cold breath, super-speed, enhance hearing, and nigh-invulnerability.” Anyone could imagine it, and recognize it when he or she sees it. But that does not mean that there exists a highly advanced physiology called “superpower” that is possessed by refugees from Krypton!  It does not mean that anabolic steroids, because they increase speed and strength, can be “scaled” to yield superpowers. And a skeptic who makes these points is not quibbling over the meaning of the word <em>superpower, </em>nor would he or she balk at applying the word upon meeting a real-life Superman. Their point is that we almost certainly will never, in fact, meet a real-life Superman. That’s because he’s defined by human imagination, not by an understanding of how things work. We will, of course, encounter machines that are faster than humans, and that see X-rays, that fly, and so on, each exploiting the relevant technology, but “superpower” would be an utterly useless way of understanding them.</p>



<p>To bring it back to productive discussions of AI: there’s plenty of room to analyze the capabilities and limitations of particular intelligent algorithms and data structures—search, pattern-matching, error back-propagation, scripts, multilayer perceptrons, structure-mapping, hidden Markov models, and so on. But melting all these mechanisms into a global variable called “intelligence,” understanding it via turn-of-the-20<sup>th</sup>-century school tests, and mentally extrapolating it with a comic-book prefix, is, in my view, not a productive way of dealing with the challenges of AI.</p>

<h2>Scott’s Response</h2>



<p>I wanted to drill down on the following passage:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Sure, you could define “superintelligence,” just as you can define “miracle” or “perpetual motion machine” or “square circle.” And you could even recognize it if you ever saw it.  But that does not make it coherent in the sense of being physically realizable.</p></blockquote>



<p>The way I use the word “coherent,” it basically <em>means</em> “we could recognize it if we saw it.”  Clearly, then, there’s a sharp difference between this and “physically realizable,” although any physically-realizable empirical behavior must be coherent.  Thus, “miracle” and “perpetual motion machine” are both coherent but presumably not physically realizable.  “Square circle,” by contrast, is not even coherent.</p>



<p>You now seem to be saying that “superintelligence,” like “miracle” or “perpetuum mobile,” is coherent (in the “we could recognize it if we saw it” sense) but not physically realizable.  If so, then that’s a big departure from what I understood you to be saying before!  I thought you were saying that we couldn’t even recognize it.</p>



<p>If you do agree that there’s a quality that we could recognize as “superintelligence” if we saw it—and I don’t mean mere memory or calculation speed, but, let’s say, “the quality of being to John von Neumann in understanding and insight as von Neumann was to an average person”—and if the debate is merely over the physical realizability of that, then the arena shifts back to human evolution.  As you know far better than me, the human brain was limited in scale by the width of the birth canal, the need to be mobile, and severe limitations on energy.  And it wasn’t optimized for understanding algebraic number theory or anything else with no survival value in the ancestral environment.  So why should we think it’s gotten anywhere near the limits of what’s physically realizable in our world?</p>



<p>Not only does the concept of “superpowers” seem coherent to me, but from the perspective of someone a few centuries ago, we arguably <em>have</em> superpowers—the ability to summon any of several billion people onto a handheld video screen at a moment’s notice, etc. etc.  You’d probably reply that AI should be thought of the same way: just more tools that will enhance our capabilities, like airplanes or smartphones, not some terrifying science-fiction fantasy.</p>



<p>What I keep saying is this: we have the luxury of regarding airplanes and smartphones as “mere tools” <em>only</em> because there remain so many clear examples of tasks we can do that our devices can’t.  What happens when the devices can do <em>everything</em> important that we can do, much better than we can?  Provided we’re physicalists, I don’t see how we reject such a scenario as “not physically realizable.”  So then, are you making an empirical prediction that this scenario, although both coherent and physically realizable, won’t come to pass for thousands of years?  Are you saying that it might come to pass much sooner, like maybe this century, but even if so we shouldn’t worry, since a tool that can do everything important better than we can do it is still just a tool?</p></div>

<p>Start with any triangulation of a convex polygon, and then repeatedly choose a random diagonal and flip it, replacing the two triangles it borders with two different triangles. Eventually, these random flips will cause your triangulation to be nearly equally likely to be any of the possible triangulations of the polygon. But how long is “eventually”? My student Daniel Frishberg has a new answer, in our preprint “Improved mixing for the convex polygon triangulation flip walk” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09972">arXiv:2207.09972</a>).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2006/fg6.png" alt="Flip graph of a hexagon" /></p>

<p>The triangulations of an \(n\)-gon, and the flips between them, form the vertices and edges of an \((n-3)\)-dimensional convex polytope called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associahedron">associahedron</a>; the example above, showing the flips of a hexagon, is from <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2006/10/13/another-gratuitously-nonplanar-drawing.html">an older post</a>. It’s difficult to convey all the symmetries of the four-dimensional associahedron (representing the triangulations of a heptagon) in a planar drawing, but here it is as a graph, at least:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/heptagon-flips.svg" alt="Flip graph of a heptagon" /></p>

<p>The number of steps until a random walk converges to near its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_distribution">stable distribution</a> is called its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_mixing_time">mixing time</a>. So another way of stating the results in the preprint is that we provide a new bound on the mixing time of associahedra. <a href="https://tetali.math.gatech.edu/PUBLIS/mt.pdf">A 1997 paper of McShine and Tetali</a> shows that this mixing time is \(O(n^5\log n)\), and we improve the exponent slightly, to \(O(n^{4.75})\). Which doesn’t sound like much, but it’s the first improvement in 25 years!</p>

<p>It’s part of a line of research Daniel has been following on mixing times, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treewidth">treewidth</a>,  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expander_graph">expansion</a> of large state spaces, including <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/05/03/hanoi-vs-sierpinski.html">Hanoi graphs</a> and <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/11/14/random-independent-sets.html">independent sets in bounded-treewidth graphs</a>. Like those other papers, it exploits known connections between mixing time, treewidth, expansion, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-commodity_flow_problem">multi-commodity flow</a> to formulate the problem as one of finding a system of paths between every pair of vertices in the associahedron in such a way that each edge of the associahedron is used only for a small fraction of these paths. The construction of these paths exploits a recursive decomposition of the associahedra into products of smaller associahedra, obtained by cutting out a central triangle of any triangulated polygon and using associahedra to describe the triangulations of the remaining pieces.</p>

<p>The same paper also includes a weaker bound on the <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2006/10/08/happy-endings-for.html">triangulations of rectangular grids of points</a>. The convex polygons have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number">Catalan number</a> of triangulations, but for grids, we can’t say as precisely how many triangulations there are. Whatever this number \(N\) is, we show that these state spaces have treewidth \(N^{1-o(1)}\), by using a fixed choice of diagonals to partition the grid into smaller grids, triangulating each smaller grid independently, and showing that there are many of these partitioned triangulations and that their product structure gives them high expansion. But this result is still somewhat unsatisfactory because it doesn’t consider all triangulations and because the \(N^{o(1)}\) part of the bound is not polynomial in the grid size. Do triangulations of grids have polynomial mixing time?</p>

A folklore conjecture in quantum computing is that the acceptance probability of a quantum query algorithm can be approximated by a classical decision tree, with only a polynomial increase in the number of queries. Motivated by this conjecture, Aaronson and Ambainis (Theory of Computing, 2014) conjectured that this should hold more generally for any bounded function computed by a low degree polynomial.

In this work we prove two new results towards establishing this conjecture: first, that any such polynomial has a small fractional certificate complexity; and second, that many inputs have a small sensitive block. We also give two new conjectures that, if true, would imply the Aaronson and Ambainis conjecture given our results. 

On the technical side, many classical techniques used in the analysis of Boolean functions seem to fail when applied to bounded functions. Here, we develop a new technique, based on a mix of combinatorics, analysis and geometry, and which in part extends a recent technique of Knop et al. (STOC 2021) to bounded functions.</div>

We say that two given polynomials $f, g \in R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, over a ring $R$, are equivalent under shifts if there exists a vector $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)\in R^n$ such that $f(x_1+a_1, \ldots, x_n+a_n) = g(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$. This is a special variant of the polynomial projection problem in Algebraic Complexity Theory.  Grigoriev and Karpinski (FOCS 1990), Lakshman and Saunders (SIAM J. Computing, 1995), and Grigoriev and Lakshman (ISSAC 1995) studied the problem of testing polynomial equivalence of a given polynomial to "any" $t$-sparse polynomial, over the rational numbers, and gave exponential time algorithms. In this paper, we provide  hardness results for this problem.
  
Formally, for a ring $R$, let $\mathrm{SparseShift}_R$ be the following decision problem -- Given a polynomial $P(X)$, is there a vector $a$ such that $P(X+a)$ contains fewer monomials than $P(X)$. We show that $\mathrm{SparseShift}_R$ is at least as hard as checking if a given system of polynomial equations over $R[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$ has a solution (Hilbert's Nullstellensatz).  

As a consequence of this reduction, we get the following results.
1. $\mathrm{SparseShift}_\mathbb{Z}$ is undecidable.
2. For any ring $R$ (which is not a field) such that $\mathrm{HN}_R$ is $\mathrm{NP}_R$-complete over the Blum-Shub-Smale model of computation, $\mathrm{SparseShift}_{R}$ is also $\mathrm{NP}_{R}$-complete.  In particular, $\mathrm{SparseShift}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ is also $\mathrm{NP}_{\mathbb{Z}}$-complete.


We also study the gap version of the $\mathrm{SparseShift}_R$ and show the following.  
1. For every function $\beta:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}_+$ such that $\beta\in o(1)$, $N^\beta$-gap-$\mathrm{SparseShift}_\mathbb{Z}$ is also undecidable (where $N$ is the input length).
2. For $R=\mathbb{F}_p, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{Z}_q$ and for every $\beta&gt;1$  the $\beta$-gap-$\mathrm{SparseShift}_R$ problem is $\mathrm{NP}$-hard. Furthermore, there exists a constant $\alpha&gt;1$ such that for every $d = O(1)$ in the sparse representation model, and for every $d\leq n^{O(1)}$ in the arithmetic circuit model, the $\alpha^d$-gap-$\mathrm{SparseShift}_R$  problem is  $\mathrm{NP}$-hard when given polynomials of degree at most $d$, in $O(nd)$ many variables, as input.</div>

<p>Thanks so much to everyone who offered help and support as this blog’s comment section endured the weirdest, most motivated and sophisticated troll attack in its 17-year history.  For a week, a parade of self-assured commenters showed up to demand that I explain and defend my personal hygiene, private thoughts, sexual preferences, and behavior around female students (and, absurdly, to cajole me into taking my family on a specific Disney cruise ship).  In many cases, the troll or trolls <em>appropriated the names and email addresses of real academics</em>, imitating them so convincingly that those academics’ closest colleagues told me they were confident it was really them.  And when some trolls finally “outed” themselves, I had no way to know whether that was just another chapter in the trolling campaign.  It was enough to precipitate an epistemic crisis, where one actively doubts the authenticity of just about <em>every</em> piece of text.</p>



<p>The irony isn’t lost on me that I’ve endured this just as I’m <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6484">starting my year-long gig at OpenAI</a>, to think, among other things, about the potential avenues for misuse of Large Language Models like GPT-3, and what theoretical computer science could contribute to mitigating them.  To say this episode has given me a more vivid understanding of the risks would be an understatement.</p>



<p><strong><em>But why didn’t I just block and ignore the trolls immediately?  Why did I bother engaging?</em></strong>  </p>



<p>At least a hundred people asked some variant of this question, and the answer is this.  For most of my professional life, this blog has been my forum, where anyone in the world could show up to raise any issue they wanted, as if we were tunic-wearing philosophers in the Athenian agora.  I prided myself on my refusal to take the coward’s way out and ignore anything—even, <em>especially</em>, severe personal criticism.  I’d witnessed how Jon Stewart, let’s say, would night after night completely eviscerate George W. Bush, his policies and worldview and way of speaking and justifications and lies, and then Bush would just continue the next day, totally oblivious, never deigning to rebut any of it.  And it became a core part of my identity that I’d never be like that.  If anyone on earth had a narrative of me where I was an arrogant bigot, a clueless idiot, etc., I’d confront that narrative head-on and refute it—or if I couldn’t, I’d reinvent my whole life.  What I’d <em>never</em> do is suffer anyone’s monstrous caricature of me to strut around the Internet unchallenged, as if conceding that only my academic prestige or tenure or power, rather than a reasoned rebuttal, could protect me from the harsh truths that the caricature revealed.</p>



<p>Over the years, of course, I carved out some exceptions: P=NP provers and quantum mechanics deniers enraged that I’d dismissed their world-changing insights.  Raving antisemites.  <em>Their</em> caricatures of me had no legs in any community I cared about.  But if an attack carried the implied backing of the whole modern social-justice movement, of thousands of angry grad students on Twitter, of <em>Slate</em> and <em>Salon</em> and <em>New York Times</em> writers and Wikipedia editors and university DEI offices, then the coward’s way out was closed.  The monstrous caricature then loomed directly over me; I could either parry his attacks or die.</p>



<p>With this stance, you might say, the astounding part is not that this blog’s “agora” model eventually broke down, but rather that it survived for so long!  I started blogging in October 2005.  It took until July 2022 for me to endure a full-scale “social/emotional denial of service attack” (not counting the comment-171 affair).  Now that I have, though, it’s obvious even to me that the old way is no longer tenable.</p>



<p>So what’s the solution?  Some of you liked the idea of requiring registration with real email addresses—but alas, when I tried to implement that, I found that WordPress’s registration system is a mess and I couldn’t see how to make it work.  Others liked the idea of moving to Substack, but others actively hated it, and in any case, even if I moved, I’d <em>still</em> have to figure out a comment policy!  Still others liked the idea of an army of volunteer moderators.  At least ten people volunteered themselves.</p>



<p>On reflection, the following strikes me as most directly addressing the actual problem.  I’m hereby establishing the <strong>Shtetl-Optimized Committee of Guardians</strong>, or SOCG (same acronym as the <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/socg21/socg.html">computational geometry conference</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /> ).  If you’re interested in joining, shoot me an email, or leave a comment on this post with your (real!) email address.  I’ll accept members only if I know them in real life, personally or by reputation, or if they have an honorable history on this blog.</p>



<p>For now, the SOCG’s only job is this: whenever I get a comment that gives me a feeling of unease—because, e.g., it seems trollish or nasty or insincere, it asks a too-personal question, or it challenges me to rebut a hostile caricature of myself—I’ll email the comment to the SOCG and ask what to do.  I commit to respecting the verdict of those SOCG members who respond, whenever a clear verdict exists.  The verdict could be, e.g., “this seems fine,” “if you won’t be able to resist responding then don’t let this appear,” or “email the commenter first to confirm their identity.”  And if I simply need reassurance that the commenter’s view of me is false, I’ll seek it from the SOCG before I seek it from the whole world.</p>



<p>Here’s what SOCG members can expect in return: I continue pouring my heart into this subscription-free, ad-free blog, and I credit you for making it possible—publicly if you’re comfortable with your name being listed, privately if not.  I buy you a fancy lunch or dinner if we’re ever in the same town.</p>



<p>Eventually, we might move to a model where the SOCG members can log in to WordPress and directly moderate comments themselves.  But let’s try it this way first and see if it works.</p></div>
