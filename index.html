<div class="content">
Assume that $X_0,X_1$ (respectively $Y_0,Y_1$) are $d_X$ (respectively $d_Y$) indistinguishable for circuits of a given size. It is well known that the product distributions $X_0Y_0,\,X_1Y_1$ are $d_X+d_Y$ indistinguishable for slightly smaller circuits. However, in probability theory where unbounded adversaries are considered through statistical distance, it is folklore knowledge that in fact $X_0Y_0$ and $X_1Y_1$ are $d_X+d_Y-d_X\cdot d_Y$ indistinguishable, and also that this bound is tight.

We formulate and prove the computational analog of this tight bound. Our proof is entirely different from the proof in the statistical case, which is non-constructive. As a corollary, we show that if $X$ and $Y$ are $d$ indistinguishable, then $k$ independent copies of $X$ and $k$ independent copies of $Y$ are almost $1-(1-d)^k$ indistinguishable for smaller circuits, as against $d\cdot k$ using the looser bound. Our bounds are useful in settings where only weak (i.e. non-negligible) indistinguishability is guaranteed. We demonstrate this in the context of cryptography, showing that our bounds yield simple analysis for amplification of weak oblivious transfer protocols.</div>

<p> I got my PhD from Harvard in 1985 with advisor Harry Lewis</p><p>Harry Lewis got his PhD from Harvard in 1974 with advisor Burton Dreben (Dreben was in the Philosophy department and did logic). Burton Dreben never got a PhD (more on that later). So I thought my lineage stopped there. A while back I was in an email conversation with Harry and for some odd reason Galileo came up.</p><p>He then emailed me the following:</p><p>----------------</p><p>Did you know you were descended from Galileo, via Newton? See below. The data is from the Math Genealogy project (see <a href="https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/">here</a>). As you know  Dreben had no PhD, but it would certainly be fair to call Quine his advisor anyway. And, in fact, the Math Geneology project lists Quine as Dreben's advisor. By starting with Dreben and clicking backwards I found the following:</p><p>In the list below everyone was advised (in some form) by the person below them.</p><p>William Gasarch, Harvard 1985</p><p>Harry Lewis, Harvard 1974</p><p>Burton Dreben, Harvard 1955</p><p>WVO Quine, Harvard 1932</p><p>AN Whitehead, Cambridge 1884</p><p>Edward John Routh, Cambridge 1857</p><p>William Hopkins, Cambridge 1830</p><p>Adam Sedgwick, Cambridge 1811</p><p>Thomas Jones, Cambridge 1782</p><p>Thomas Postlethwaite, Cambridge 1756</p><p>Stephen Whisson, Cambridge 1742</p><p>Walter Taylor, Cambridge 1723</p><p>Robert Smith, Cambridge 1715</p><p>Roger Coles, Cambridge 1706</p><p>Isaac Newton, Cambridge 1668</p><p>Isaac Barrow, Cambridge 1652</p><p>Vincenzo Viviani, Pisa 1642</p><p>Galileo Galilei, Pisa 1585</p><p>--------------------------------------</p><p>A few observations</p><p>1) Dreben was a philosophy professor at Harvard without a PhD. How? He was a Junior Fellow, which is for brilliant people, some of which were made professors without  the burden of going  through the PhD-getting ritual.  Andrew Gleason was a professor of Math at Harvard without a PhD-- also a junior fellow (he solved Hilbert's 5th problem, which surely helped). Tom Cheatham was a CS professor at Harvard who did not have a PhD but  was <i>not</i> a junior fellow. I do not know how he did that. Things are more formal now, and more people have PhD's, so I suspect it is much rarer to be a professor without a PhD.  Harvard still has the Junior Fellows Program, but even they have PhDs now. If someone solved P vs NP as an ugrad, I suspect they would be hired as a professor even though they do not have a PhD. That's one way for a theorist to get out of taking graduate systems courses. </p><p>2) Note that Galileo and Vincenzo were in Pisa but then a long line of people from Cambridge. In those days schools hired their own. Is this good or bad? They know what they are getting, but you could have an old-boys-network blocking fresh new talent, and you may get stuck in your ways. Nowadays, at least in America, it is uncommon to stay at the same school as you got your PhD.</p><p>3) The shift from Pisa to Cambridge might be part of a more general phenomena--- the intellectual center for science shifting from Italy to England. What caused this? Amir Alexander, in his book <i>Infinitesimals: How a dangerous mathematical idea shaped the modern world </i>(see my review <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/bookrev/FRED/inf.pdf">here</a> ) speculates that the Catholic Church's rejection of Infinitesimals was the cause.  I suspect that letting non-scientists interfere with science was the cause (a lesson for us all).</p><p>4) Lance did a blog on his lineage <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2005/06/eulerian-tour.html">here</a>. He has Gauss and Euler as ancestors. </p><p>5) To honor the myths about  my two most famous academic ancestors, Galileo and Newton,  I am going to travel to Italy and have Darling drop two apples of different weights off the leaning tower of Pisa and see if they hit my head at the same time.</p><div><br /></div></div>

Hessian metric has proved to be quite effective in optimization, and has been
the subject of study for sampling. The Mirror Langevin Diffusion (MLD) is a
sampling analogue of mirror flow in continuous time, and it has nice
convergence properties under log-Sobolev or Poincare inequalities relative to
the Hessian metric, as shown by Chewi et al. (2020). In discrete time, a simple
discretization of MLD is the Mirror Langevin Algorithm (MLA) studied by Zhang
et al. (2020), who showed a biased convergence bound with a non-vanishing bias
term (does not go to zero as step size goes to zero). This raised the question
of whether we need a better analysis or a better discretization to achieve a
vanishing bias. Here we study the basic Mirror Langevin Algorithm and show it
indeed has a vanishing bias. We apply mean-square analysis based on Li et al.
(2019) and Li et al. (2021) to show the mixing time bound for MLA under the
modified self-concordance condition introduced by Zhang et al. (2020).

neighbors ($k$-NN) queries for a set of $n$ point sites in $O(f(n) + k)$ time,
where $f(n)$ is some polylogarithmic function of $n$. The key component is a
general query algorithm that allows us to find the $k$-NN spread over $t$
substructures simultaneously, thus reducing a $O(tk)$ term in the query time to
$O(k)$. Combining this technique with the logarithmic method allows us to turn
any static $k$-NN data structure into a data structure supporting both
efficient insertions and queries. For the fully dynamic case, this technique
allows us to recover the deterministic, worst-case, $O(\log^2n/\log\log n +k)$
query time for the Euclidean distance claimed before, while preserving the
polylogarithmic update times. We adapt this data structure to also support
fully dynamic \emph{geodesic} $k$-NN queries among a set of sites in a simple
polygon. For this purpose, we design a shallow cutting based, deletion-only
$k$-NN data structure. More generally, we obtain a dynamic $k$-NN data
structure for any type of distance functions for which we can build vertical
shallow cuttings. We apply all of our methods in the plane for the Euclidean
distance, the geodesic distance, and general, constant-complexity, algebraic
distance functions.

congruent balls (that is, balls of equal radius) that together cover all the
points in $P$ and whose radius is minimized. The $k$-center problem with
outliers is defined similarly, except that $z$ of the points in $P$ do need not
to be covered, for a given parameter $z$. We study the $k$-center problem with
outliers in data streams in the sliding-window model. In this model we are
given a possibly infinite stream $P=\langle p_1,p_2,p_3,\ldots\rangle$ of
points and a time window of length $W$, and we want to maintain a small sketch
of the set $P(t)$ of points currently in the window such that using the sketch
we can approximately solve the problem on $P(t)$.
</p>
<p>We present the first algorithm for the $k$-center problem with outliers in
the sliding-window model. The algorithm works for the case where the points
come from a space of bounded doubling dimension and it maintains a set $S(t)$
such that an optimal solution on $S(t)$ gives a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate
solution on $P(t)$. The algorithm is deterministic and uses
$O((kz/\varepsilon^d)\log \sigma)$ storage, where $d$ is the doubling dimension
of the underlying space and $\sigma$ is the spread of the points in the stream.
Algorithms providing a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation were not even known in
the setting without outliers or in the insertion-only setting with outliers. We
also present a lower bound showing that any algorithm that provides a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation must use $\Omega((kz/\varepsilon)\log \sigma)$
storage.

scale-free networks, which are ubiquitous in many fields, from social network
analysis to biology. However, working with this model is algorithmically and
conceptually challenging because of the nature of the distances in the
hyperbolic plane. In this paper, we propose a discrete variant of the HRG model
where nodes are mapped to the vertices of a triangulation; our algorithms allow
us to work with this model in a simple yet efficient way. We present
experimental results conducted on networks, both real-world and simulated, to
evaluate the practical benefits of DHRG in comparison to the HRG model.

(0,1)$ that are combinatorially list-decodable up to a radius approaching
$1-R$, which is the information-theoretic limit. This is established by
starting with the full-length $[q,k]_q$ Reed-Solomon code over a field $\mathbb
F_q$ that is polynomially larger than the desired dimension $k$, and
"puncturing" it by including $k/R$ randomly chosen codeword positions.
</p>
<p>Our puncturing result is more general and applies to any code with large
minimum distance: we show that a random rate $R$ puncturing of an $\mathbb
F_q$-linear "mother" code whose relative distance is close enough to $1-1/q$ is
list-decodable up to a radius approaching the $q$-ary list-decoding capacity
bound $h_q^{-1}(1-R)$. In fact, for large $q$, or under a stronger assumption
of low-bias of the mother-code, we prove that the threshold rate for
list-decodability with a specific list-size (and more generally, any "local"
property) of the random puncturing approaches that of fully random linear
codes. Thus, all current (and future) list-decodability bounds shown for random
linear codes extend automatically to random puncturings of any low-bias (or
large alphabet) code. This can be viewed as a general derandomization result
applicable to random linear codes.
</p>
<p>To obtain our conclusion about Reed-Solomon codes, we establish some hashing
properties of field trace maps that allow us to reduce the list-decodability of
RS codes to its associated trace (dual-BCH) code, and then apply our puncturing
theorem to the latter. Our approach implies, essentially for free, optimal rate
list-recoverability of punctured RS codes as well.

the result is unstable against noises. Stable volumes and stable sub-volumes
are proposed to solve the problem. In a special case, we prove that a stable

stable volumes and sub-volumes on HomCloud, persistent homology based data

David Zuckerman has a beautiful result on the approximate hardness of the clique problem. His <a href="https://www.theoryofcomputing.org/articles/v003a006/v003a006.pdf">paper</a>, “Linear Degree Extractors and the Inapproximability of Max Clique and Chromatic Number,” has has received almost 1,000 citations since it was first published in 2007. Wow.</p>
<p>
Today we discuss a possible relevance of this result for P versus NP.</p>
<p>
Recall a clique is a subset of nodes of an undirected graph, such that every two nodes in the subset are connected by an edge. Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_%28graph_theory%29">illustration</a> below does not have large cliques—only two cliques of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{4}" class="latex" /> nodes shaded blue to go with a bunch of triangles shaded lighter.</p>

<p></p><p><br />
Is there a relatively small change we could make to the graph to give it a much larger clique? At top right, we could add two edges to extend the blur <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{4}" class="latex" />-clique to a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{5}" class="latex" />-clique—a pentagram inside a pentagon. At bottom left we could add <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{4}" class="latex" /> edges to make the four triangles blossom into a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B6%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{6}" class="latex" />-clique.</p>
<p>
Computing the size of the largest clique in a graph—or just telling whether it has a clique of a given size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />—is a famous NP-complete problem. Counting the number of cliques of the largest size is evidently a harder problem still. Yet you might think it easier to tell a graph with only small cliques apart from a graph that has large ones. This is where David’s result comes in.</p>

<p></p><p>
It is fundamentally a de-randomization result. Our idea is to scale it down in a way that may bring <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5Cwidetilde%7BP%7D+%5Cneq+N%5Cwidetilde%7BP%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{\widetilde{P} \neq N\widetilde{P}}}" class="latex" /> into contact with mathematical theorems that govern effects of the scaling. The theorems may be adjacent to conjectures that can suggest new approaches. The idea may require bringing back randomization, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Question </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Our quest to build on David’s theorem leads us to interpose a classic idea. In work with Paul Erdős, Tibor Radó wrote <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%5Crightarrow%28H%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G\rightarrow(H)}" class="latex" /> to mean that every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2}" class="latex" />-coloring of the edges of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> has a monochromatic subgraph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" />. The classic two-color Ramsey theorem states that for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" /> there is a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%5Crightarrow%28K_r%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G\rightarrow(K_r)}" class="latex" />. Erdős and George Szekeres further showed <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> can have fewer than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7B2r%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2^{2r}}" class="latex" /> nodes. </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Definition 2</b> <em> Say an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />-node graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> is <b><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" />-Radó</b> if every edge 2-coloring of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> leaves a clique of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Clog+n+-+c%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\frac{1}{2}\log n - c}" class="latex" /> vertices. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
In Radó’s notation, this is if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG+%5Crightarrow+%28K_%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Clog_2+n+-+c%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G \rightarrow (K_{\frac{1}{2}\log_2 n - c})}" class="latex" />. The first point is that all clumpy graphs are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" />-Radó for large enough <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" />. Taking <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc+%5Cgeq+2%5Clog_2%28%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cepsilon%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c \geq 2\log_2(\frac{1}{\epsilon})}" class="latex" /> puts the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\epsilon n}" class="latex" />-sized clique above the Erdős-Szekeres bound for the Ramsey property to hold. </p>
<p>
Thus the key question becomes:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em><a name="limpid"></a> Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> is a limpid graph. Can <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> also be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" />-Radó? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Suppose the answer is <b>no</b>. Then every limpid graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> has an edge 2-coloring that does not leave a clique of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Clog+n+-+c%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k = \frac{1}{2}\log n - c}" class="latex" />. We can verify this in quasi-polynomial time by trying all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />-subsets of the vertices. </p>
<p>
This sets up a situation where both “limpid” and “clumpy” have an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BN%5Cwidetilde%7BP%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{N\widetilde{P}}}" class="latex" /> witness. More to the point, we obtain the modified problem of distinguishing “clumpy” from “not <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" />-Radó” (for appropriately chosen <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" />).

</p><p></p><h2> The Quest For Limpid Radó Graphs </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
If, like most, you believe <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5Cwidetilde%7BP%7D+%5Cneq+N%5Cwidetilde%7BP%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{\widetilde{P} \neq N\widetilde{P}}}" class="latex" />, or further in the “ESY”-type strengthening of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5Cwidetilde%7BNP%7D+%5Cneq+%5Ctext%7Bco-%7DN%5Cwidetilde%7BP%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{\widetilde{NP} \neq \text{co-}N\widetilde{P}}}" class="latex" />, then the answer must be that limpid (almost-)<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" />-Radó graphs exist. The question of <em>finding</em> them, however, has a long trail that leads back into complexity theory.</p>
<p>
To begin, let’s decouple the clique size from the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> of nodes by considering graphs with a clique of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B6%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{6}" class="latex" /> to be “lumpy,” and use the original form of the Radó property: every 2-edge coloring has a monochrome triangle. It is surprisingly hard to find a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_6%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{K_6}" class="latex" />-free graph with the property. Brute-force attempts for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B7%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{7}" class="latex" />-node and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B8%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{8}" class="latex" />-node graphs that are maximal for having no <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_6%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{K_6}" class="latex" /> fail:</p>

<p></p><p><br />
The smallest <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_6%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{K_6}" class="latex" />-free graph with the Radó triangle property that we know how to build has <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3D14%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n=14}" class="latex" /> nodes and comes from a proof that the Radó triangle property is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" />-complete. The proof is in a 1985 <a href="https://bd.booksc.org/book/5907065/04eeae">paper</a> by Moon-Jung Chung, W. Michael Evangelist, and Ivan Hal Sudborough. The graph at left, which looks like a bat, is such that any 2-edge coloring without a monochrome triangle must give the two edges marked <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> the same color—whichever color is used for two edges of the middle triangle. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/09/26/a-possible-ramsey-insight-into-p-versus-np/ces1985graphs/" rel="attachment wp-att-19151"><img width="550" alt="" src="https://i1.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CES1985graphs.jpg?resize=550%2C236&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-19151" height="236" /></a></p>
<p>
Joining a bat and an upside-down bat creates the graph at right, in which the edges marked <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbar%7Bx%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bar{x}}" class="latex" /> must have opposite colors. This creates a truth-assignment gadget for each pair of literals <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x_i}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbar%7Bx%7D_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bar{x}_i}" class="latex" /> in a 3CNF formula <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" /> given as instance of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" />-complete Not-All-Equal 3SAT <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not-all-equal_3-satisfiability">problem</a>. Using one triangle per clause of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" />, connecting more batch between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x_i}" class="latex" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbar%7Bx%7D_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bar{x}_j}" class="latex" /> appearing in the clause to the corresponding edges in the truth gadgets creates a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_6%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{K_6}" class="latex" />-free graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG_%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G_\phi}" class="latex" /> that has the Radó property if and only if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" /> has an assignment making 1 or 2 literals true in each clause. </p>
<p>
Then every negative instance <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" /> induces a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_6%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{K_6}" class="latex" />-free Radó graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG_%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G_\phi}" class="latex" />. We can get one more simply, however, by adding a third “bat” to the graph at right above that connects <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbar%7Bx%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bar{x}}" class="latex" />. The resulting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B14%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{14}" class="latex" />-node graph has no 2-edge coloring without making a monochrome triangle.</p>
<p>
To be truly “limpid,” however, the graph should exclude smaller cliques. The following problem of Erdős and Radó was open for some time:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Does there exist a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_4%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{K_4}" class="latex" />-free graph with the Radó triangle property? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
This was <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2099355">solved</a> in 1970 by Jon Folkman and then improved in 1987 by a probabilistic argument of Joel Spencer, in a <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82159088.pdf">paper</a> titled, “Three Hundred Million Points Suffice.” That’s right: for the minimum Radó criterion he showed there is a limpid graph with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN+%3C+%5Cmathbf%7B300%2C000%2C000%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N &lt; \mathbf{300,000,000}}" class="latex" /> nodes. This 2007 <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~spr/PUBL/paper53.pdf">paper</a> by the Ramsey-theory experts Stanisław Radziszowski and Xu Xiaodong proves that the minimum possible <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N}" class="latex" /> is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B19%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{19}" class="latex" /> and gives evidence that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN+%5Cleq+127%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N \leq 127}" class="latex" /> is plausible. let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN_%7B3%2C3%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N_{3,3}}" class="latex" /> stand for the least possible such <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>
However one such graph exists, it must give rise to a “bat”-type construction and forthwith a reduction showing the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" />-completeness of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{K_4}" class="latex" />-free Radó property. Thus the Ramsey-type existence question is entangled with complexity theory. How this relationship <em>scales</em> up for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" />-Radó and clumpy versus limpid graphs is the point we are driving at.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Ramsey Scaling And Complexity </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
There are two main levers by which we are scaling:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Up from the constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{3}" class="latex" /> of the Radó triangle property to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Clog_2%28n%29+-+c%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\rho = \frac{1}{2}\log_2(n) - c}" class="latex" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" />-Radó. <p></p>
</li><li>
Up to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%3Dn%5E%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k=n^\epsilon}" class="latex" /> as the allowed clique size in a <em>limpid</em> graph.
</li></ul>
<p>
The latter corresponds to the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\epsilon n}" class="latex" /> size for <em>clumpy</em> that we are distinguishing, but there is some freedom in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" />. If we imagine <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\rho}" class="latex" /> as fixed—temporarily ignoring the dependence on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />—we can ask, what is the minimum size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN+%3D+N_%7B%5Crho%2Ck%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N = N_{\rho,k}}" class="latex" /> of a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />-limpid graph that is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" />-Radó? </p>
<p>
To avoid a complexity collapse, we must bet on at worst a single-exponential dependence on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\rho}" class="latex" />, polynomial in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />. Can we possibly show this directly? Note that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho+%3D+3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\rho = 3}" class="latex" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+%3D+3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k = 3}" class="latex" /> already raised the specter of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN_%7B3%2C3%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N_{3,3}}" class="latex" /> in the hundred millions. Not only do we not see a way to scale up Spencer’s proof, he remarked in the intro that his proof is “extremely case specific” and does not scale even to 3-edge colorings. The “almost” feature of Definition <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/feed/#almost">3</a> adds a further complication.</p>
<p>
It may be that the guiderails for ascending to higher <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\rho}" class="latex" /> (scaling with the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> of nodes) are already present among the details of the graph constructions in David’s proof and the proofs of the theorems his paper builds on. We have not had time to delve. There must be <em>some</em> connection; the question is whether complexity considerations take the lead or follow only in train of the sides that can be mathematically disproved.  Other connections of Ramsey theory are in this nice 2004 <a href="https://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/DS13/pdf">survey</a> by Vera Rosta.</p>
<p>
Here is one more indication of why we think the interaction between complexity and Ramsey theory can be nontrivial. Putting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR+%3D+2%5Er%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{R = 2^r}" class="latex" />, the upper bound noted above for the diagonal-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" /> Ramsey number has rough order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{R^2}" class="latex" />. The best known lower bound has rough order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%5E%7B1%2F2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{R^{1/2}}" class="latex" />. Can we show an impact of the growth of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{R}" class="latex" /> on complexity theory, in advance of resolving this gap which has been open for over fifty years?</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The key issue is, what about the above question? Assuming the usual belief that quasi-polynomial time and nondeterministic quasi-polynomial time are distinct we must be able to show a fact about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2}" class="latex" />-colorings of clumpy and limpid graphs. If this is hard to prove, then we have an interesting impasse. Even worse, if this is false, then our beliefs collapse. </p>
<p></p><p><br />
The feature that surprises us about the 1986 Putnam <a href="https://kskedlaya.org/putnam-archive/1986.pdf">exam</a> is that it does <em>not</em> have a question that involves the number <b>1,986</b>. Ken and I both remember such features. Here is a problem they could have used; we will give the answer later:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Alan and Barbara play a game in which they take turns filling entries of an initially empty 1986 x 1986 array. Alan plays first. At each turn, a player chooses a real number and places it in a vacant entry. The game ends when all the entries are filled. Alan wins if the determinant of the resulting matrix is nonzero; Barbara wins if it is zero. Which player has a winning strategy? </em>

Lattice Isometry Space (LISP) to the practical case of dimension 3. A periodic
3-dimensional lattice is an infinite set of all integer linear combinations of
basis vectors in Euclidean 3-space. Motivated by crystal structures determined
in a rigid form, we study lattices up to rigid motion or isometry, which is a
composition of translations, rotations and reflections. The resulting space
LISP consists of infinitely many isometry classes of lattices. In dimension 3,
we parameterise this continuous space LISP by six coordinates and introduce new
metrics satisfying the metric axioms and continuity under all perturbations.
This parameterisation helps to visualise hundreds of thousands of real crystal
lattices from the Cambridge Structural Database for the first time.

meaningful (non-linear) low-dimensional embeddings of high-dimensional data.
MDS has a long history in the statistics, machine learning, and graph drawing
communities. In particular, the Kamada-Kawai force-directed graph drawing
method is equivalent to MDS and is one of the most popular ways in practice to
embed graphs into low dimensions. Despite its ubiquity, our theoretical
understanding of MDS remains limited as its objective function is highly
non-convex. In this paper, we prove that minimizing the Kamada-Kawai objective
is NP-hard and give a provable approximation algorithm for optimizing it, which
in particular is a PTAS on low-diameter graphs. We supplement this result with
experiments suggesting possible connections between our greedy approximation
algorithm and gradient-based methods.

advantage of symmetries inherent in a given problem setting. Here, we provide
efficient quantum algorithms for performing linear group convolutions and
cross-correlations on data stored as quantum states. Runtimes for our
algorithms are logarithmic in the dimension of the group thus offering an
exponential speedup compared to classical algorithms when input data is
provided as a quantum state and linear operations are well conditioned.
Motivated by the rich literature on quantum algorithms for solving algebraic
problems, our theoretical framework opens a path for quantizing many algorithms
in machine learning and numerical methods that employ group operations.

genetic material can be represented by leaf-labelled, directed graphs called
phylogenetic networks. A major challenge in the burgeoning area of phylogenetic
networks is to develop algorithms for building such networks by amalgamating
small networks into a single large network. The level of a phylogenetic network
is a measure of its deviation from being a tree; the higher the level of
network, the less treelike it becomes. Various algorithms have been developed
for building level-1 networks from small networks. However, level-1 networks
may not be able to capture the complexity of some data sets. In this paper, we
present a polynomial-time algorithm for constructing a rooted binary level-2
phylogenetic network from a collection of 3-leaf networks or trinets. Moreover,
we prove that the algorithm will correctly reconstruct such a network if it is
given all of the trinets in the network as input. The algorithm runs in time
$O(t\cdot n+n^4)$ with $t$ the number of input trinets and $n$ the number of
leaves. We also show that there is a fundamental obstruction to constructing
level-3 networks from trinets, and so new approaches will need to be developed
for constructing level-3 and higher level-networks.

Garey\&amp;Jonhson's book. We are given a grid with $n$ vertical and horizontal
slots and a dictionary with $m$ words and are asked to place words from the
dictionary in the slots so that shared cells are consistent. We attempt to
pinpoint the source of intractability of this problem by taking into account
the structure of the grid graph, which contains a vertex for each slot and an
edge if two slots intersect. Our main approach is to consider the case where
this graph has a tree-like structure. Unfortunately, if we impose the common
rule that words cannot be reused, we show that the problem remains NP-hard even
under very severe structural restrictions. The problem becomes slightly more
tractable if word reuse is allowed, as we obtain an $m^{tw}$ algorithm in this
case, where $tw$ is the treewidth of the grid graph. However, even in this
case, we show that our algorithm cannot be improved. More strongly, we show
that under the ETH the problem cannot be solved in time $m^{o(k)}$, where $k$
is the number of horizontal slots of the instance.
</p>
<p>Motivated by these mostly negative results, we consider the much more
restricted case where the problem is parameterized by the number of slots $n$.
Here, we show that the problem becomes FPT, but the parameter dependence is
exponential in $n^2$. We show that this dependence is also justified: the
existence of an algorithm with running time $2^{o(n^2)}$ would contradict the
randomized ETH. Finally, we consider an optimization version of the problem,
where we seek to place as many words on the grid as possible. Here it is easy
to obtain a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation, even on weighted instances. We show
that this algorithm is also likely to be optimal, as obtaining a better
approximation ratio in polynomial time would contradict the Unique Games
Conjecture.

correct outputs with high probability even when the stream updates are chosen
by an adversary who may observe and react to the past outputs of the algorithm.
We grow the burgeoning body of work on such algorithms in a new direction by
studying robust algorithms for the problem of maintaining a valid vertex
coloring of an $n$-vertex graph given as a stream of edges. Following standard
practice, we focus on graphs with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ and aim for
colorings using a small number $f(\Delta)$ of colors.
</p>
<p>A recent breakthrough (Assadi, Chen, and Khanna; SODA~2019) shows that in the
standard, non-robust, streaming setting, $(\Delta+1)$-colorings can be obtained
while using only $\widetilde{O}(n)$ space. Here, we prove that an adversarially
robust algorithm running under a similar space bound must spend almost
$\Omega(\Delta^2)$ colors and that robust $O(\Delta)$-coloring requires a
linear amount of space, namely $\Omega(n\Delta)$. We in fact obtain a more
general lower bound, trading off the space usage against the number of colors
used. From a complexity-theoretic standpoint, these lower bounds provide
(i)~the first significant separation between adversarially robust algorithms
and ordinary randomized algorithms for a natural problem on insertion-only
streams and (ii)~the first significant separation between randomized and
deterministic coloring algorithms for graph streams, since deterministic
streaming algorithms are automatically robust.
</p>
<p>We complement our lower bounds with a suite of positive results, giving
adversarially robust coloring algorithms using sublinear space. In particular,
we can maintain an $O(\Delta^2)$-coloring using $\widetilde{O}(n
\sqrt{\Delta})$ space and an $O(\Delta^3)$-coloring using $\widetilde{O}(n)$
space.

<p>You’re probably familiar with the fact that you can draw a convex octagon with corners in an integer grid, fitting into a \(3\times 3\) square. It’s not regular, because its side lengths alternate between \(1\) and \(\sqrt 2\), but it has the same angles as a regular octagon and looks close enough to it for some purposes.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/7way-octagon.svg" alt="3x3 integer octagon and its 7-ply tiling of the plane" /></p>

<p>It also has another interesting property: if you place copies of it at every point of the integer grid, then each edge of each copy is also the edge of another copy. Therefore, if you let \(p\) be any point that avoids the edges of the octagons, count the number of octagons that cover any point of the plane, and then slide \(p\) around to another edge-avoiding point, the number of covering octagons always stays unchanged. Whenever \(p\) slides off from one octagon, it slides onto another one. Because the area of the integer octagon is seven units, and you’re placing one octagon for every unit square of the grid, the average covering depth is seven. And since the covering depth stays the same everywhere, it’s seven everywhere. You can think of this collection of octagons as forming a <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(7\)-ply</span> tiling of the plane, despite the fact that convex octagons cannot tile the plane in the usual \(1\)-ply sense of tiling.</p>

<p>More generally, define a \(k\)-ply tiling to be a covering of the plane by congruent copies of some prototile (allowing rotations, even though these are not necessary for the octagon) such that, except at a subset of the plane of measure zero (the boundaries of the prototiles), every point is covered by exactly \(k\) copies, and define the “ply” of a prototile to be the minimum \(k\) such that it has a \(k\)-ply tiling. The integer octagon has <span style="white-space: nowrap;">ply \(7\):</span> once one octagon is placed anywhere in the plane, the rest of the tiling is forced to follow in the same way around it, in order to avoid creating seams where an octagon edge is not matched by another octagon and the ply changes. The same construction, using centrally symmetric octagons with integer vertices and longer sides, produces for any \(k\ge9\) a convex tile of <span style="white-space: nowrap;">ply \(k\).</span></p>

<p>This is the subject of my new short paper (or maybe extended abstract) “Multifold tiles of polyominoes and convex lattice polygons”, with many coauthors from the 2017 Bellairs Winter Workshop on Computational Geometry: Kota Chida, Erik Demaine, Martin Demaine, Adam Hesterberg, Takashi Horiyama, John Iacono, Hiro Ito, Stefan Langerman, Ryuhei Uehara, and Yushi Uno. You can find it in the <a href="http://www.math.science.cmu.ac.th/tjcdcggg/Book-abstract.pdf">book of abstracts of the 23rd Thailand–Japan Conference on Discrete and Computational Geometry, Graphs, and Games (TJCDCG<sup>3</sup> 2020+1)</a>, which was organized online by Chiang Mai University earlier this month.</p>

<p>As well as the family of octagon \(k\)-ply tilers described above, we found that cutting the bottom row of squares off a \(3\times 3\) octagon produces a \(5\)-ply hexagon tiler, this time requiring \(180^\circ\)-degree rotations for its tiling, and that stretching this hexagon can produce an <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(8\)-ply</span> convex tiler. We also found polyomino <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(k\)-ply</span> tilers for <span style="white-space: nowrap;">all \(k\ge 2\),</span> and three heptominoes (the smallest possible polyominoes) that can each form <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(k\)-ply</span> tilings for all \(k\ge 2\) but not for <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(k=1\).</span> I imagine the details will become available in a more complete paper at some point but for now the abstract just announces these results and gives pictures of these heptominoes. We still don’t know whether there can exist convex polygons whose ply is one of <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(\{2,3,4,6\}\).</span></p>

<p>The TJCDCG<sup>3</sup> abstract book has many other intriguing results in discrete geometry, graph theory, and combinatorial game theory, so do check it out if you’re interested. Tiling-related highlights include a variation on Wang tiling adding connectivity constraints and inspired by a dungeon-making mini-game in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em> (“Tiling the Plane Connectively with Wang Tiles”, Chao Yang), signal processing using high-dimensional substitution tilings (“Generating Frames via Discretized Substitution Tilings”, Luis S. Silvestre Jr. and Job A. Nable), a partial classification of edge-to-edge monohedral tilings of the sphere (“Tiling of the Sphere by Congruent Polygons”, Yohji Akama, Hoi Ping Luk, Erxiao Wang, and Min Yan), and tilings that can be used to make arrays of joined-up origami cranes (“Renzuru Tilings with Asymmetric Quadrilaterals”, Takashi Yoshino).</p>

<p>Here’s yesterday’s clickbait offering from <em>Scientific American</em>, the once-legendary home of Martin Gardner’s Mathematical Games column:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-the-term-jedi-is-problematic-for-describing-programs-that-promote-justice-equity-diversity-and-inclusion/">Why the Term ‘JEDI’ Is Problematic for Describing Programs That Promote Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion</a></p>



<p>The sad thing is, I see few signs that this essay was meant as a Sokal-style parody, although in many ways it’s written as one.  The essay actually develops a 100% cogent, reasoned argument: namely, that the ideology of the <em>Star Wars</em> films doesn’t easily fit with the new ideology of militant egalitarianism at the expense of all other human values, including irony, humor, joy, and the nurturing of unusual talents. The authors are merely oblivious to the conclusion that most people would draw from their argument: namely, so much the worse for the militant egalitarianism then!</p>



<p>I predict that this proposal—to send the acronym “JEDI” the way of “mankind,” “blacklist,” and, err, “quantum supremacy”—will meet with opposition even from the wokeists themselves, a huge fraction of whom (in my experience) have soft spots for the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise.  Recall for example that in 2014, Laurie Penny used <em>Star Wars</em> metaphors in her <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/uncategorized/2014/12/on-nerd-entitlement-rebel-alliance-empire">interesting response</a> to my comment-171, telling male nerds like me that we need to learn to accept that “[we’re] not the Rebel Alliance, [we’re] actually part of the Empire and have been all along.”  Admittedly, I’ve never <em>felt like</em> part of an Empire, although I’ll confess to some labored breathing lately when ascending flights of stairs.</p>



<p>As for me, I spent much of my life opposed in principle to <em>Star Wars</em>—I hated how the most successful “science fiction” franchise of all time became that way <em>precisely</em> by ditching any pretense of science and fully embracing mystical woo—but sure, when the chips are down, I’m crazy and radical enough to take the side of Luke Skywalker, even if a team of woke theorists is earnestly, unironically explaining to me that lightsabers are phallocentric and that Vader ranks higher on the intersectional oppression axis because of his breathing problem.</p>



<p>Meantime, of course, the US continues to <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fopinions%2F2021%2F09%2F23%2Frobert-kagan-constitutional-crisis">careen toward its worst Constitutional crisis since the Civil War</a>, as Trump prepares to run again in 2024, and as this time around, the Republicans are systematically purging state governments of their last Brad Raffenspergers, of anyone who might stand in the way of them simply setting aside the vote totals and declaring Trump the winner regardless of the actual outcome.  It’s good to know that my fellow progressives have their eyes on the ball—so that when that happens, at least universities will no longer be using offensive acronyms like “JEDI”!</p></div>

<h3><a class="entryheader" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/09/24/which-integer-sequences.html">Which integer sequences form denominators of Egyptian fractions?</a></h3>
<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from 
<a class="entryheader" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/" title="11011110">David Eppstein</a>
<p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>I have a new paper out: “<a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL24/Eppstein/eppstein2.html">Egyptian Fractions with Denominators from Sequences Closed Under Doubling</a>”, in the <em>Journal of Integer Sequences</em>. (There should also be an arXiv version soon but despite my long association with arXiv they made me get an endorser before I could upload to the number theory category, slowing down my submission there.)</p>

<p>Anyway, it’s basically a journal version of an old blog post here, “<a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2016/11/20/egyptian-fractions-with.html">Egyptian fractions with practical denominators</a>”. That post concerned the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_number">practical numbers</a>, positive integers \(n\) such that all other positive integers up to \(n\) can be represented as sums of distinct divisors of \(n\). This definition gives the practical numbers a natural connection to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_fraction">Egyptian fractions</a>, representations of rational numbers as sums of distinct unit fractions: if you represent a number \(k&lt;n\) by a sum of distinct divisors of \(n\), and then divide everything by \(n\), you get an Egyptian fraction for \(k/n\). Zhi-Wei Sun asked whether the practical numbers and Egyptian fractions were connected in a different way, with every positive integer having an Egyptian fraction representation in which all denominators are practical, and my blog post provides a positive answer to Sun’s question.</p>

<p>The new paper simplifies the presentation of the solution, compared to the blog post, by providing direct formulas for the representation rather than an iterative computational method for finding it. But beyond that, it also shows that the same method (based on dividing by a large power of two and dealing separately with the quotient and remainder) works for many other integer sequences beyond the practical numbers. All it needs from an integer sequence is two simple properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The sequence should include a multiple of every integer. In order to represent \(k/p\) as an Egyptian fraction, when \(p\) is prime, the denominators must include at least one multiple of \(p\), so the requirement of including multiples is pretty natural in this context.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For every number \(n\) that belongs to the sequence, \(2n\) should also belong to the sequence. This is the “closed under doubling” of the new article’s title, and is closely connected to the method used by the article involving division by powers of two.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever a sequence \(S\) of positive integers has both properties, we can find Egyptian fractions for all positive rationals up to \(\sum_{x\in S}1/x\), the natural limiting value for such representations. When \(\sum_{x\in S}1/x\) diverges, we get all positive rationals. As well as the practical numbers, this works for some other nice sequences including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odious_number">odious</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_number">evil</a> numbers, the <a href="https://oeis.org/A001013">orders of isomorphism groups of trees</a>, and the <a href="https://oeis.org/A003714">fibbinary numbers</a>, numbers whose binary representation avoids consecutive ones. Because they’re based on binary representations, the doubling property of odious, evil, and fibbinary numbers follows from their definitions; the existence of multiples of other integers in these sequences is less obvious but was more or less already known. Isomorphism groups of trees have orders that are the products of factorials, from which (because 2 is a factorial and \(n!\) is a multiple of \(n\)) both properties follow immediately.</p>

<p>Although these two properties are sufficient for a sequence to form Egyptian fractions for rationals up to its natural limit, they are not necessary. Ron Graham’s PhD dissertation was on the same topic, and showed that the sequence of squares greater than one has the same property. (The sequence of all squares, including one, is a little more complicated: its sums of distinct reciprocals can represent all rationals in the intervals \([0,\pi^2/6-1)\) and \([1,\pi^2/6)\) but can’t cover the gap between these two intervals.) Characterizing which sequences do or do not form representations of this type more generally seems like an interesting question, but one that I don’t have much idea how to attack at this point.</p>

<div class="content">
We prove the existence of Reed-Solomon codes of any desired rate $R \in (0,1)$ that are combinatorially list-decodable up to a radius approaching  $1-R$, which is the information-theoretic limit. This is established by starting with the full-length $[q,k]_q$ Reed-Solomon code over a field $\mathbb{F}_q$ that is polynomially larger than the desired dimension $k$, and "puncturing" it by including $k/R$ randomly chosen codeword positions. 
		
Our puncturing result is more general and applies to any code with large minimum distance: we show that a random rate $R$ puncturing of an $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear "mother" code whose relative distance is close enough to $1-1/q$ is list-decodable up to a radius approaching the $q$-ary list-decoding capacity bound $h_q^{-1}(1-R)$. In fact, for large $q$, or under a stronger assumption of low-bias of the mother-code, we prove that the threshold rate for list-decodability with a specific list-size (and more generally, any "local" property) of the random puncturing approaches that of fully random linear codes. Thus, all current (and future) list-decodability bounds shown for random linear codes extend automatically to random puncturings of any low-bias (or large alphabet) code. This can be viewed as a general derandomization result applicable to random linear codes. 
		
To obtain our conclusion about Reed-Solomon codes, we establish some hashing properties of field trace maps that allow us to reduce the list-decodability of RS codes to its associated trace (dual-BCH) code, and then apply our puncturing theorem to the latter. Our approach implies, essentially for free, optimal rate list-recoverability of punctured RS codes as well.</div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a model of privacy-preserving machine learning that has garnered significant interest in recent years due to its rigorous privacy guarantees. An algorithm differentially private if the output is stable under small changes in the input database. While DP has been adopted in a variety of applications, most applications of DP in industry actually satisfy a stronger notion called local differential privacy. In local differential privacy data subjects perturb their data before it reaches the data analyst. While this requires less trust, it comes a substantial cost to accuracy. Recent work of Erlingsson, Feldman, Mironov, Raghunathan, Talwar, and Thakurta [EFMRTT19] demonstrated that random shuffling amplifies differential privacy guarantees of locally randomized data. Such amplification implies substantially stronger privacy guarantees for systems in which data is contributed anonymously [BEMMRLRKTS17] and has led to significant interest in the shuffle model of privacy [CSUZZ19, EFMRTT19]. In this talk, we will discuss a new result on privacy amplification by shuffling, which achieves the asymptotically optimal dependence in the local privacy parameter. Our result is based on a new proof strategy which is simpler than previous approaches, and extends to a lightly weaker notion known as approximate differential privacy with nearly the same guarantees.</p>
<p>Based on joint work with Vitaly Feldman and Kunal Talwar (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12803">https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12803</a>).</p></blockquote></div>

<p>An <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06438">undergrad thesis</a> from North Carolina State University tries to tackle the question as to why computer science has used conferences as its main and most prestigious publication venues. The author Elijah Bouma-Sims gives a synopsis with some interesting follow up conversation in this <a href="https://twitter.com/ElijahBoumaSims/status/1439041100111548419">Twitter thread</a>.</p><p>The upshot is that the conference culture grew organically early in computing and just took hold as the field grew. My personal non-scientific theory is that technology not available to earlier fields, namely jet airplanes, allowed CS to have national and international meetings that researchers could regularly attend. Before that conferences in more established fields like math were held either locally (<a href="http://www.ams.org/meetings/sectional/sectional.html">AMS sectional meetings</a>) or less often (<a href="https://www.mathunion.org/icm/icm-2022">ICM</a> held every four years), traditions that continue to this day.</p><p>Covid has temporarily suspended fully on-site conferences, and new technologies allow us to have virtual meetings. It's still not clear what will be the new normal for conferences. I hope we get to the model where we have more virtual meetings and rarer in-person meetings that people make more of an effort to attend. Conferences focused on networking instead of publications.</p><p>The culture of conference publications has been slowly changing. Many subfields in CS, though not no much theory, have moved to a hybrid model where papers are submitted to a journal and those accepted are invited to be presented at a conference.</p><p>Conferences used to be the first place you would hear about new results but that's no longer the case. Papers posted on <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> get noticed and Google Scholar doesn't distinguished citations to an arXiv paper differently from any other publication venue. </p><p>Now you don't even need a presentation or a paper, just a promise of one. How many of you are excited about linear-size locally testable codes based on a <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/events/breakthroughs-locally-testable-codes-constant-rate-distance-and-locality">talk announcement</a> alone?</p></div>

We propose a diagonalization-based approach to several important questions in proof complexity. We illustrate this approach in the context of the algebraic proof system IPS and in the context of propositional proof systems more generally.

We give an explicit sequence of CNF formulas $\{\phi_n\}$ such that VNP$\neq$VP iff there are no polynomial-size IPS proofs for the formulas $\phi_n$. This provides the first natural equivalence between proof complexity lower bounds and standard algebraic complexity lower bounds. Our proof of this fact uses the implication from IPS lower bounds to algebraic complexity lower bounds due to Grochow and Pitassi together with a diagonalization argument: the formulas $\phi_n$ themselves assert the non-existence of short IPS proofs for formulas encoding VNP$\neq$VP at a different input length. Our result also has meta-mathematical implications: it gives evidence for the difficulty of proving strong lower bounds for IPS within IPS.

More generally, for any strong enough propositional proof system $R$ we propose a new explicit hard candidate, the iterated $R$-lower bound formulas, which inductively asserts the non-existence of short $R$ proofs for formulas encoding this same statement at a different input length. We show that these formulas are unconditionally hard for Resolution following recent results of Atserias and Muller and of Garlik. We further give evidence in favour of this hypothesis for other proof systems.</div>

<p>Though I singled out a mask study <a href="https://www.argmin.net/2021/09/13/effect-size/">in the last post</a>, I’ve had a growing discomfort with statistical modeling and significance more generally. Statistical models explicitly describe the probability of outcomes of experiments in terms of specific variables of individuals from a population. Such statistical models bring with them a host of assumptions and powers. But when are they appropriate for deducing significance of the outcomes of experiments? Here, I’ll argue that they are almost never appropriate in most settings, and, moreover, they can result in confidence intervals that rarely contain the correct parameters.</p>

<p>Note that in order to sample from some population, we need not assume that the population is <em>itself</em> random. An experimenter can choose to sample one individual from a larger pool at random even when the pool is a deterministic collection. Similarly, the experimenter can randomly assign each member of the pool to a group for experimentation even when the pool is deterministic. We need not build a statistical model of our population in order to study it experimentally.</p>

<p>But the convention in much scientific practice entangles the randomness used in survey and experiment design with the randomness of the natural world. The dominant convention in experimental sciences is to assert the existence of a probability distribution from which all observations in an experiment are samples. That is, most analyses begin with the assumption that the population is itself a stochastic entity whose statistical properties can be accurately modeled. Such probabilistic modeling is immediately problematic. We are forced to confront the notion of probability itself. What does the probability of an event mean? Is a Bayesian or Frequentist viewpoint more correct? What does it mean to sample a natural process?</p>

<p>My perspective on the pitfalls of probabilistic modeling has been heavily influenced by the writings of David Freedman. Freedman advocates for a pragmatic approach to statistical modeling. “<a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Preprints/611.pdf">Probability is just a property of a mathematical model intended to describe some features of the natural world. For the model to be useful, it must be shown to be in good correspondence with the system it describes.</a>” This is the less pithy, but more prescriptive version of Box’s famous and tiresome aphorism “All models are wrong, but some are useful.”</p>

<p>Model building and validation requires deep domain knowledge for a task at hand. One of my favorite models is Ohm’s law, which states that the current that flows across a conductive material is proportional to the voltage drop across the resistor. Due to thermal noise, the actual model is</p>

\[\small{
  \text{current} = \text{material constant} \times \text{voltage} + \text{noise}}\]

<p>And the noise is Gaussian white noise. This model has been extensively tested and is a foundation of all circuit design. Remarkably, this simple formula describes complex electronic behavior. Physics is full of amazing examples of statistical models that accurately predict the outcome of experiments to a dozen significant figures.</p>

<p>But in biology, medicine, social science, and economics, our models are much less accurate and less grounded in natural laws. Most of the time, models are selected because they are convenient, not because they are plausible, well motivated from phenomenological principles, or even empirically validated. Freedman built a cottage industry around pointing out how poorly motivated many of the common statistical models are.</p>

<p>A particular example called out by Freedman is the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27645896">ubiquitous logistic regression model</a>. Freedman observed that in a variety of randomized control trials, experimenters would “correct” the estimates of their randomized controlled trials by “controlling for fixed effects” with logistic regression. Controlling for fixed effects is pernicious jargon that means “set up a regression problem with all of the variables that one thinks make their effect size look too small, and then solve the regression as an attempt to remove the influence of these variables.” It is most common in observational studies, but many insist it is appropriate in the context of randomized controlled trials as well. This convention of correction persists in the present, and I highlighted similar corrections in my last post. Freedman argues that such corrections are misguided, especially in the context of randomized trials.</p>

<p>To understand the motivation for using logistic in the first place, I need to tell you what an odds ratio is. Experiments are often interested in estimating an odds ratio of particular outcomes. The odds of an outcome is the number of individuals with a positive outcome divided by the number of individuals with a negative outcome. If the odds of winning a lottery are one million to one, that means that for every person that wins, one million people lose.</p>

<p>In the context of randomized experiments, let’s suppose that when given a treatment, M out of N individuals will have a favorable outcome, and without treatment only Q out of N will have a positive outcome Then the odds ratio is simply the ratio of the odds of the outcome with and without treatment</p>

\[\small{
\frac{M}{N-M} \cdot \frac{N-Q}{Q}\,.}\]

<p>When the odds ratio is large, we deem a treatment to be highly effective.</p>

<p>Logistic regression posits that individuals have a vector of features $Z$ that influence the odds of the effectiveness of treatment. Specifically, if $Y$ is the indicator of the desired outcome and $X$ is indicator of treatment, the logistic regression model asserts the log of the odds the outcome is a linear function of the treatment and the selected features. Since the model assumes the population is random, we can write the fraction of individuals with a positive outcome as probability. With this identification, the assumption of logistic regression is</p>

\[\small{
\log  \frac{p(Y=1 | X,Z ) }{ 1-p(Y=1 | X,Z) } = \beta X + \gamma^\top Z + \alpha \,.}\]

<p>This model is convenient if we are interested in odds ratios. In the logistic model, no matter what the covariate $Z$, the odds ratio is</p>

\[\small{
\frac{p(Y=1 | X=1,Z ) } {1-p(Y=1| X=1,Z) }  \cdot \frac{1-p(Y=1 | X=0, Z)}{p(Y=1 | X=0, Z)} = e^\beta\,.}\]

<p>Hence, if we can estimate beta, we can estimate the odds ratio. And if we can estimate the variance of beta, we can compute confidence intervals over our odds ratio estimates.</p>

<p>But all of this assumes that the model is correct! If the logistic model is not correct, then our confidence intervals are meaningless. Or at least, they are not confidence intervals around any true notion of odds ratios.</p>

<p>It’s almost always reasonable to be suspicious of this logistic model. It is first asserting that the odds ratio is a constant for a fixed covariate $Z$. That is, all subjects experience the same proportional effect of treatment. Even less realistically, the model asserts that the outcome is positive for an individual $i$ with treatment value $X_i$ and covariate value $Z_i$ if</p>

\[\small{
  U_i  \leq \alpha + \beta X_i + \gamma^\top Z_i\,,}\]

<p>where $U_i$ is a random variable sampled from the logistic distribution. The model assumes the $U_i$ are independent of the treatment and the covariates, the $U_i$ are independent across all of the individuals, and the $U_i$ have a common logistic distribution. The only thing that differs between treatment and control is the value of the threshold on the left hand side. These are a lot of assumptions, and they are seldom verified or tested in papers where logistic regression is applied.</p>

<p>The question remains: does this matter? Do these modeling assumptions actually affect our inferences about effect size? Freedman provides an elegant argument demonstrating that logistic regression always overestimates the true odds ratio, and sometimes can do so quite poorly. He also shows that simply computing a plugin estimator of the odds ratio with no covariate adjustment at all is consistent in randomized controlled trials. That is, there is no need to adjust for covariates in randomized controlled trials if you want an accurate estimate of the odds ratio. Furthermore, covariate adjustments can lead to significant overestimation of the treatment’s effect size.</p>

<p>Rather than going through Freedman’s theoretical argument, it’s a bit more evocative to give an example. The following is gleaned from a helpful discussion with Joel Middleton. Suppose you sample 10000 children from a larger population where each child in the population has an equal chance of liking and disliking vegetables. We propose a treatment of bribing kids with a cookie to eat their veggies, and randomly assign this treatment to half of the subjects. Left untreated, veggie haters have a 20% probability of finishing their veggies, but veggie lovers have an 80% probability of eating their greens. When bribed with a cookie, veggie haters and veggie lovers have 25% and 85% of eating their vegetables, respectively.</p>

<p>An average child in the study has a probability of 50% of eating their veggies if in control and 55% if in treatment. The log odds ratio is thus</p>

\[\small{
  \log \frac{.55}{1−.55}−\log\frac{.5}{1−.5} \approx 0.2\,.}\]

<p>Now, when you instead run logistic regression, the coefficient of the treatment variable is larger than 0.2. Indeed, <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/argmin.net/code/logistic_logodds_example.ipynb">when I try this in python</a>, running 1000 synthetic experiments, I find that the median point estimate is 0.32, which is, as promised, larger than the true log odds. Even more worrisome is the 95% confidence interval contains 0.2 only 38% of the time. Clearly, the confidence intervals are not accurate when the model is wrong.</p>

<p>When the true effect size is large, this discrepancy between the logistic regression estimate and the true log odds might not be that big a deal: your error bars are wrong, but the effect size is estimated in the correct direction. But the results of such logistic regression analyzes are regularly quoted as estimates of odds ratios (For example, look at any  observational study of vaccine effectiveness). The precision of these estimates is unfortunately lacking and misleading.</p>

<p>Even if the model <em>was</em> true, the same argument shows that the coefficient of the treatment variable overestimates the log-odds. This is demonstrated in the <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/argmin.net/code/logistic_logodds_example.ipynb">second example in the python notebook</a>. Even when the model is true, the coefficient of the treatment variable is an overestimate of the true log odds. If the model was true, one could at least say they had constructed a reasonable estimate of the change in odds for an individual under treatment. But if the model is wrong, there’s nothing we can say at all other than we have overestimated the effect size and our error bars might not contain the true odds with any certainty.</p>

<p>So what is the remedy here? The thing is, we already know the answer: if we randomized the assignment, we can estimate log odds by counting the number of positive outcomes under treatment and control, and then just plugging these values into the odds ratio. If you do this, you find an estimate whose median is precisely equal to the true log odds. No covariate adjustment is required.</p>

<p>This is merely one example showing why it is critical to decouple the randomness used to probe a system from the randomness inherent in its system itself. Statistical models are not necessary for statistical inference, but randomness itself is amazingly… let’s say… <em>useful</em> for understanding natural phenomena. I will spend the next few blogs reminding myself and you faithful blog readers that proper experiments, machine learning predictions, and statistical summarizations can all be designed without statistical models of populations. Perhaps the mathematical formalizations of randomized algorithms can suggest paths to reform conventional experimental formalism.</p></div>

<p> As of Sept 17, Matt Amodio has won 23 straight games in a row on Jeopardy and won over $800,000 in regular play. The following website is not quite up to date, but its close: <a href="https://www.jeopardy.com/contestant-zone/hall-of-fame">here</a>. Of course, that website will change. </p><p>1) They refer to him as <i>A CS grad student from a school in New Haven</i>. My first thought was <i>probably</i> <i>Yale, but whatever it is, they should just say it. </i>I looked it up and it is Yale. So why aren't they just saying <i>A CS grad student from Yale?  </i>If someone works for <i>an airline company</i> they do not tell you which airline- prob to avoid giving that airline free publicity. But I would think a school is different. And I remember (perhaps incorrectly) that they DO say what school someone teaches at or is a student at. </p><p>(ADDED LATER: a colleague of mine who was on Jeop (he lost his only game) tells me that YES, you re NOT ALLOWED to say the company you work for. He was from <i>Riverdale Park, MD </i>which might make some people think there is a <i>Univ of MD at Riverdale Park</i> . He also told me that when he was on the show the following happened:  <i>On One of the shows of the game before I  played, Alex was curious which LA area restaurant somebody worked at (to see if he had eaten there--- he hadn't), and sure enough, they edited the name of the restaurant out.)</i></p><p>2) Longest streak: Ken Jennings: 74. Also most money in reg play: roughly 2.5 Mill</p><p>    2nd longest: James Holzhauer: 32. Also  2nd most money in reg play: roughly 2.4 Mill</p><p>    3rd longest: Matt Amodio: 23. Also  3rd most money in reg play: roughly 0.8 Mill</p><p>3) I do not think Matt will move into second place on any of these categories. He bets big on the daily doubles and it has paid off but either (a) he will miss and it will lead to a loss, or (b) he will just not get the daily double and be against a very good opponent. Item (b) happened to James H- and the person who beat him did have a good enough win streak to be in the Tournament of Champions. I wonder if they try to stop a long streak by picking really good opponents. I also wonder if they can even tell who will be a really good opponent. </p><p>4) Matt has played in front of (or will- counting tomorrow) six hosts: Robin Roberts, LeVar Burton, David Faber, Joe Buck, Mike Richards, and Mayim Bialik. Six is a record which I suspect won't be broken, except possibly by Matt himself if he also plays in front of Ken Jennings (the rest of 2021 will be Mayim B and Ken J as hosts, see <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/16/1037930905/mayim-bialik-ken-jennings-host-jeopardy">here</a>.</p><p>5) Matt works in AI. When he gets his PhD and is on the job market will his Jeopardy success help him, hurt him, or neither?  </p><p>6) James H and Matt A are both very good at calculating how much to bet. I think Ken J is not quite as good but still good. Generally the players on Jeop are not that good at that aspect. I had the chance to ask some a champions (not any of those three) why that was and she said that most people get into because of the trivia-aspect, not the betting aspect. I wonder if just as players now study lots of facts to prep, they will also learn how to bet better. </p><p>7) Ken J as host is a bit odd in that, if he says (as Alex T did sometimes) <i>That category looks hard </i>I won't believe him. I also have this suspicion that when a contestant gets something wrong Ken might be thinking <i>what a moron; </i>however, (a) by all accounts Ken is a nice guy, and (b)  I might be projecting. </p></div>

<p><b> Ken is a Mathematician </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Ken is of course a co-author of this blog. We try to cover computer science and mathematics, but we are open to other areas. Ken started his career in Mathematics; he obtained a PhD in math from Oxford University in 1986. It was under Dominic Welsh and was tilted: <i>On the separation of complexity classes</i>. Welsh’s family tree is <a href="https://users.monash.edu.au/~davidwo/files/Welsh-FamilyTree.pdf">here</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Ken is a Programmer </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Ken is of course famous for being one of the world’s top chess cheating detectors. Recall to cheat at chess is to use a computer program to make your moves in a game against a human opponent. This is strictly illegal. </p>
<p>
Ken was featured on the cover in <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/personal/JuneCLarticleKWR.pdf">chess review</a>. His work gets critic review <a href="https://kar.kent.ac.uk/44719/">here</a> by David Barnes and Julio Hernandez-Castro in the 2015 article <i>On the limits of engine analysis for cheating detection in chess</i> in the journal Computers and Security.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Ken is Unique </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Ken is special in many ways. He is smart, he is a wonderful partner, and he is a great friend. I would claim that he is one of the few people that have the following three properties:</p>
<ol>
<li> He is an international master in chess of rating <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2372%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2372}" class="latex" />;
</li><li> He is a strong researcher in complexity theory;
</li><li> He is a terrific programmer.
</li></ol>
<p>
The last I would claim is pretty remarkable. There are many strong chess players, there are many of us working in complexity theory. But few have written as much production quality code as Ken has. For his work on chess cheating he has had to write thousands of lines of code. This code must run fast, and be correct. The latter, correctness, is really important. This since his work on detecting cheating has led players to be suspended from chess for years. It also has helped protect players who did not cheat, even though many thought they had. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Again I wish him a wonderful unbirthday day.</p>

<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>This Erev Yom Kippur, I wish to repent for not putting enough quantum computing content on this blog.  Of course, repentance is meaningless unless accompanied by genuine reform.  That being the case, please enjoy the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLmGfNKCLU">YouTube video of my ACM TechTalk from last week about quantum supremacy</a>—although, as you’ll see if you watch the thing, I oscillate between quantum supremacy and other terms like “quantum advantage” and even “quantum supremadvantage.”  This represents the first time ever that I got pushback about a talk before I’d delivered it for political reasons—the social-justice people, it turns out, are <em>actually serious</em> about wanting to <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4450">ban the term “quantum supremacy”</a>—but my desire to point out all the difficulties with their proposal competed with my desire not to let that issue overshadow my talk.</p>



<p>And there’s plenty to talk about!  While regular <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers will have already heard (or read) most of what I say, I make some new comments, including about the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03494">new paper from last week</a>, the night before my talk (!), by the USTC group in China, where they report a quantum supremacy experiment based on random circuit sampling with a superconducting chip, this time with a record-setting 60 qubits and 24 layers of gates.  On the other hand, I also stress how increasing the circuit fidelity has become a <em>much</em> more urgent issue than further increasing the number of qubits (or in the case of BosonSampling, the number of photons), if our goal is for these experiments to remain a couple steps ahead of classical spoofing algorithms.</p>



<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy my lovingly handcrafted visuals.  Over the course of this pandemic, I’ve become a full convert to writing out my talks with a stylus pen rather than PowerPointing them—not only is it faster for me, not only does it allow for continuous scrolling rather than arbitrary divisions into slides, but it enforces simplicity and concision in ways they <em>should</em> be enforced.</p>



<p>While there was only time for me to field a few questions at the end of the talk, I later supplied <a href="https://on.acm.org/t/quantum-computational-supremacy/2106/2?u=acm-learning">written answers to 52 questions (!!) that I hadn’t gotten to</a>.  If <em>you</em> have a question, please check to see if it’s already there, and otherwise ask away in the comments!</p>



<p>Thanks so much to Yan Timanovsky for inviting and organizing this talk, and to whurley for hosting it.</p></div>

Unfortunately, because of the missing grid element, \(F\) is not a lattice homomorphism.</p>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>Way back in 2005, I posed <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/qchallenge.html">Ten Semi-Grand Challenges for Quantum Computing Theory</a>, on at least half of which I’d say there’s been dramatic progress in the 16 years since (most of the challenges were open-ended, so that it’s unclear when to count them as “solved”).  I posed <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=471">more open quantum complexity problems</a> in 2010, and some <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=663">classical complexity problems</a> in 2011.  In the latter cases, I’d say there’s been dramatic progress on about a third of the problems.  I won’t go through the problems one by one, but feel free to ask in the comments about any that interest you.</p>



<p>Shall I push my luck as a problem-poser?  Shall or shall not, I have.</p>



<p>My impetus, this time around, was a kind invitation by Travis Humble, the editor-in-chief of the new <em><a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/tqc">ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing</a></em>, to contribute a perspective piece to that journal on the occasion of my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5448">ACM Prize</a>.  I agreed—but only on the condition that, rather than ponderously pontificate about the direction of the field, I could simply discuss a bunch of open problems that I wanted to see solved.  The result is below.  It’s coming soon to an arXiv near you, but <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers get it first.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/open.pdf">Open Problems Related to Quantum Query Complexity</a></strong>  (11 pages, PDF)</p><p>by Scott Aaronson</p><p><em>Abstract:</em> I offer a case that quantum query complexity still has loads of enticing and fundamental open problems—from relativized QMA versus QCMA and BQP versus IP, to time/space tradeoffs for collision and element distinctness, to polynomial degree versus quantum query complexity for partial functions, to the Unitary Synthesis Problem and more.</p></blockquote>



<p>Some of the problems on my new hit-list are ones that I and others have flogged for years or even decades, but others, as far as I know, appear here for the first time.  If your favorite quantum query complexity open problem, or a problem I’ve discussed in the past, is missing, that doesn’t mean that it’s been solved or is no longer interesting—it might mean I simply ran out of time or energy before I got to it.</p>



<p>Enjoy!  And tell me what I missed or got wrong or has a trivial solution that I overlooked.</p></div>
