<p>I am reading Wolfgang's Book <a href="https://drona.csa.iisc.ac.in/~deepakd/atc-common/wolfgang-aat.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Applied Automata Theory </a>, wherein, I came across what Monadic Second Order Logic means. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MSO stands for “monadic second-order”:
  Second-order because it allows quantification not only over (first-order) position
  variables but also over (second-order) set variables.
  Monadic because quantification is allowed at most over unary (monadic) relations,
  namely sets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a fundamental question , how do position variables become first order variables, and how are set variables second order? I am not able to go further, since I cannot wrap my head around this. </p></div>

Vu</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00479">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>Vizing showed that it suffices to color the edges of a simple graph using
$\Delta + 1$ colors, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph.
However, up to this date, no efficient distributed edge-coloring algorithms are
known for obtaining such a coloring, even for constant degree graphs. The
current algorithms that get closest to this number of colors are the randomized
$(\Delta + \tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{\Delta}))$-edge-coloring algorithm that runs in
$\text{polylog}(n)$ rounds by Chang et al. (SODA '18) and the deterministic
$(\Delta + \text{polylog}(n))$-edge-coloring algorithm that runs in
$\text{poly}(\Delta, \log n)$ rounds by Ghaffari et al. (STOC '18).
</p>
<p>We present two distributed edge-coloring algorithms that run in
$\text{poly}(\Delta,\log n)$ rounds. The first algorithm, with randomization,
uses only $\Delta+2$ colors. The second algorithm is a deterministic algorithm
that uses $\Delta+ O(\log n/ \log \log n)$ colors. Our approach is to reduce
the distributed edge-coloring problem into an online, restricted version of
balls-into-bins problem. If $\ell$ is the maximum load of the bins, our
algorithm uses $\Delta + 2\ell - 1$ colors. We show how to achieve $\ell = 1$
with randomization and $\ell = O(\log n / \log \log n)$ without randomization.

understanding algorithmic tractability: if the clique-width of a graph class
${\cal G}$ is bounded by a constant, a wide range of problems that are
NP-complete in general can be shown to be polynomial-time solvable on ${\cal
G}$. For this reason, the boundedness or unboundedness of clique-width has been
investigated and determined for many graph classes. We survey these results for
hereditary graph classes, which are the graph classes closed under taking
induced subgraphs. We then discuss the algorithmic consequences of these
results, in particular for the Colouring and Graph Isomorphism problems. We
also explain a possible strong connection between results on boundedness of
clique-width and on well-quasi-orderability by the induced subgraph relation
for hereditary graph classes.

method for hexahedral (hex) meshes using a weighted ranking approach. In
previous work, the selection of to-be-collapsed base complex sheets/chords is
only based on their thickness, which will introduce a few closed-loops and
cause an early termination of simplification and a slow convergence rate. In
this paper, a new weighted ranking function is proposed by combining the
valence prediction function of local singularity structure, shape quality
metric of elements and the width of base complex sheets/chords together.
Adaptive refinement and local optimization are also introduced to improve the
uniformity and aspect ratio of mesh elements. Compared to thickness ranking
methods, our weighted ranking approach can yield a simpler singularity
structure with fewer base-complex components, while achieving comparable
Hausdorff distance ratio and better mesh quality. Comparisons on a hex-mesh
dataset are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

disjoint union of cliques via a minimum number of edge editing operations. In
this paper we introduce a new variant of Cluster Editing whereby a vertex can
be divided, or split, into two or more vertices thus allowing a single vertex
to belong to multiple clusters. This new problem, Cluster Editing with Vertex
Splitting, has applications in finding correlation clusters in discrete data,
including graphs obtained from Biological Network analysis. We initiate the
study of this new problem and show that it is fixed-parameter tractable when
parameterized by the total number of vertex splitting and edge editing
operations. In particular we obtain a 4k(k + 1) vertex kernel for the problem
and an $\Oh^*(2^{\Oh(k^2)})$ search algorithm.

when we think of it as reflecting abstract rationality restrictions on vectors
of two-valued judgments on a number of issues. In Computational Social Choice
Theory, and in particular in the theory of judgment aggregation, a domain is
called a possibility domain if it admits a non-dictatorial aggregator, i.e. if
for some $k$ there exists a unanimous (idempotent) function $F:D^k \rightarrow
D$ which is not a projection function. We prove that a domain is a possibility
domain if and only if there is a propositional formula of a certain syntactic
form whose set of satisfying truth assignments, or models, comprise the domain.
A formula whose set of satisfying truth assignments is equal to a given
arbitrary domain $D$ is sometimes referred to as an integrity constraint for
$D$. So we call {\em possibility} integrity constraints the formulas of the
specific syntactic type we define. Given a possibility domain $D$, we show how
to construct a possibility integrity constraint for $D$ efficiently, i.e, in
polynomial time in the size of the domain. We also show how to distinguish
formulas that are possibility integrity constraints in linear time in the size
of the input formula. Our result falls in the realm of classical results that
give syntactic characterizations of logical relations that have certain closure
properties, like e.g. the result that logical relations component-wise closed
under logical AND are precisely the models of Horn formulas. However, our
techniques draw from results in judgment aggregation theory as well from
results about propositional formulas and logical relations.

<div class="content">
<p>In the classical IMP language, the definition of weakest precondition is:</p>

<pre><code>definition "wp c Q s ≡ ∃t. (c,s) ⇒ t ∧ Q t"
</code></pre>

<p>This is stating that from state s, after executing c we get to a state satisfying Q. My question comes when handling the selection construct in the language of guarded commands (see selection command in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_transformer_semantics" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>). My guess is that in this case one needs to define:</p>

<pre><code>definition "wp c Q s ≡ ∃t. (c,s) ⇒ t ∧ (∀ t'. (c,s) ⇒ t' ⟶ Q t)"
</code></pre>

<p>I wonder if this is correct. Currently, I'm having problems proving the weakest precondition definition for the sequential composition of commands:</p>

<pre><code>"wp (c1;;c2) Q s = wp c1 (wp c2 Q) s" 
</code></pre>

<p>So, I'm beginning to think my definition is wrong.</p>

<p>Does anybody see what am I doing wrong?</p></div>

<p>I was very sad to hear that Jean Bourgain, among the greatest mathematicians of our time, and a dear friend, passed away.  I first met Jean about forty years ago and later we have become friends and collaborators.  In the 80s and 90s Jean used to visit Israel quite often and had close collaboration with the Banach space Israeli community, and with the Ergodic theory community,  and with the Harmonic analysis community, and the PDE community, and later also with the combinatorics, probability,  algebra, number theory,  and theoretical computer science communities.  I always admired his immense mathematical powers and his deep devotion to mathematics.</p>
<p>You can read about Jean Bourgain in Terry Tao’s <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2018/12/29/jean-bourgain/">beautiful obituary post</a>.  I was also moved by Svetlana Jitomirskaya’s beautiful <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10106557607678501&amp;set=a.10102850768938051&amp;type=3&amp;theater">facebook post</a>. Some of Jean’s contributions to combinatorics (which formed a small portion of his interests) are mentioned in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/tag/jean-bourgain/">several posts </a>over my blog (and my lecture below). I will try to come back to these mathematical topics at a later post and here I post a few pictures of Jean over the years.

I guess I'm not sure how <span class="math-container">$\lambda x.(x\,(\lambda y.y))$</span> reduces to <span class="math-container">$\lambda x.\lambda y.y$</span> . How is the variable <span class="math-container">$x$</span> behaving here? One stab in the dark would be to reason that <span class="math-container">$\lambda x.x$</span> is the identity function, therefore, <span class="math-container">$(\lambda x.x)(\lambda y.y)$</span> would reduce to <span class="math-container">$\lambda y.y$</span>, which is not what we want. So I understand the <em>not</em> part. . . . BTW, how do <span class="math-container">$\lambda x.\lambda y.y$</span> and <span class="math-container">$\lambda x.(\lambda y.y)$</span> differ?</p></div>

<div class="content">
<p>I decided to ask this question after being attracted by how much one can do with the knowledge in computer science, including iOS application development, game(or mods) development, website creating, etc., but having trouble with matching what I learned with what I really understood. </p>

<p>Realizing the lack of knowledge in programming, I once decided to learn programming in a specific language, like Objective-C and Swift. After I tried every single textbook on OC programming, I found myself wasting time in the "explanation" part and getting lost with the real "theoretical" part. It seems to me that those textbooks prefer a long and loose explanation in describing a concept without telling me what exactly it is(Like the notion of "Object" and "Pointer") and skip the real important "thinking" before the implementation of the code. Although after many times of reading I could create a very simple application(like a simple calculator), I was still very lost in how it really works.</p>

<p>That reminds me how I began to learn mathematics. In middle school "function" is just "<span class="math-container">$y=f(x)$</span>", where <span class="math-container">$f(x)$</span> can be <span class="math-container">$x^2$</span>, <span class="math-container">$\sin(x)$</span>, and other operations about <span class="math-container">$x$</span>. However, now for me <span class="math-container">$f$</span> is a set of tuples satisfying the unique mapping property, or an arrow with domain and codomain. More generally, I can give a affirmative response to every question like "what is (the definition of) this?(in a math sentence.)" So I asked myself, "what is most basic among all subjects in computer science"? </p>

<p>Based on the belief that computer system and programming can be completely theoretical, I decided to learn from the very basic. That's when I began to have trouble because of the lack of knowledge in the computer science world. Where is the code for my programming environment?(For me, Xcode) and how can I understand it? What is a computer made of (up to the transistors), and how do them work together? 
But then I found out that there is no book with the name similar to "how a computer works" that reach my satisfaction, which I thought is my vocabulary problem. </p>

<p>I hope that in the book I'm looking for, every keyword is rigorously defined, and without any waste of time in explaining what a notion "means" or how it is developed stage by stage historically. I expect that it gives only the goals(like the adding machine) and how to build it from the given definitions(a graph with the nodes of value "0" or "1"). Every textbooks in mathematics(like the GTM series) reach this goal, and for me, that is MUCH easier to read and understand. I think most of the math student like me will prefer this style of learning.</p>

<p>What is a good (book) route for a math student to self study computer science from the basic? I wish there are some theoretical textbooks that build the whole operation system, compiler, or some of this kind, that is readable to math students. Any answer would be much appreciated. Thank you. </p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<div>Thirty-five years ago, <a href="https://www.imtlucca.it/rocco.denicola" target="_blank">Rocco De Nicola</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wIto1LUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Matthew Hennessy</a> published the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3975(84)90113-0" target="_blank">archival paper </a>introducing the notions of testing equivalence over concurrent processes in the journal Theoretical Computer Science. These testing equivalences embody in a natural and mathematically elegant way the intuitive idea that two processes should be equated unless they behave differently when subjected to some ‘experiment’ or ‘test’. The origin of this notion of equivalence can be traced back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz" target="_blank">Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz </a>(1646–1716), who stated that two mathematical objects are equal if there is no test to distinguish them. In the semantics of programming languages, its earliest precursor is, to the best of my  knowledge, the notion of contextual equivalence proposed by Morris in his doctoral dissertation.<br /><br />In general, given a set of processes, a set of tests and a relation between processes and tests that describes when a process passes a test, one can apply Leibniz’s motto and declare two processes to be equivalent if if they pass exactly the same set of tests. In the work of De Nicola and Hennessy, processes are states in some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_system" target="_blank">labelled transition system</a>. A test is itself a process, which interacts with a concurrent system under observation by hand-shake synchronisation and uses a distinguished action to report success in its observation. Since both processes and tests may be nondeterministic, the interaction between a process and a test may lead to different outcomes depending on how the two systems resolve their nondeterministic choices in the course of a computation. This led De Nicola and Hennessy to define three notions of testing semantics, which are naturally expressed in terms of preorders over processes.<br /><br />In the so-called may semantics, a process q is at least as good as some process p if the set of tests that p may pass is included in the set of tests that q may pass. In may semantics, possible failure under a test is immaterial and therefore nondeterminism is angelic. On the other hand, one may take the view that failure in the testing effort is catastrophic, in the sense that a process that may fail some test is just as bad as one that always fails it. The notion of testing semantics that captures this viewpoint is the so-called must semantics, according to which a process q is at  least as good as some process p if the set of tests that p must pass is included in the set of tests that q must pass. Finally, a third testing preorder over processes is obtained as the intersection of the may and must preorders described above. According to this more refined view of process behaviour, a process that always fails a test is worse than one that may pass that test, which in turn is worse than one that always passes it.<br /><br />De Nicola and Hennessy explored the rich theory of the testing semantics in their seminal TCS paper (see <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/algebraic-theory-processes" target="_blank">this monograph</a> for a classic, book-length treatment), where each of these semantics is given operational, denotational and axiomatic accounts that are in agreement one with the other. Their ideas and the accompanying technical results have had an enormous impact on further research, as witnessed, among other things, by the 1,640 citations to the TCS paper published in 1984 (source: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Meb6JFkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Google Scholar </a>today).<br /><br />Happy 2019 to everyone.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div><div class="commentbar"><p></p><span href="http://processalgebra.blogspot.com/feeds/5864407579793524954/comments/default" class="commentbutton"></span><a href="http://processalgebra.blogspot.com/feeds/5864407579793524954/comments/default"><img src="/images/feed-icon.png" class="commenticon" /> Subscribe to comments</a>  | <a href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=27705661&amp;postID=5864407579793524954"><img src="/images/post-icon.png" class="commenticon" /> Post a comment</a></div></div>

<p>I wonder if there are any known implications of Babai's recent quasi-polynomial time algorithm for Graph Isomorphism to <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/a/22494/419">separating words by DFA's</a>.
In both cases the ultimate goal is to differentiate some object, though the conditions are quite different.
I would like to know what people more familiar with Babai's proof think about whether some of the ideas there are applicable to word separation or not.</p></div>

<p>In the same way that the Busy Beaver function is defined for Turing Machines, we could define a similar function for the untyped lambda calculus:</p>

<p>Over all terms in the ULC composed of <code>n</code> abstractions, variables and applications, which has the longest normal form?</p>

<p>This could be defined in a couple ways: we could consider only strongly normalizing ULC terms, or we could look for the longest normal form over all replacements.</p>

<p>Clearly, this function is not computable for arbitrarily large <code>n</code>, for the same reason as for the standard Busy Beaver function. However, I am interested in whether anything is known about this function for small values of <code>n</code>. What values is it known for? What bounds exists for higher <code>n</code>? For what <code>n</code> is the value known to be independent of ZFC?</p></div>

<p>I am trying to understand co-NP and its implications properly.</p>

<p>The French Wikipedia <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-NP" rel="nofollow noreferrer">page</a> describing co-NP provides the "complementary" version of the Hamiltonian cycle in co-NP as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Considering a graph G, is it true that it does not have an Hamiltonian cycle?
</code></pre>

<p>Is this correct?</p>

<p>If so, then how is this complementary version a different class of complexity than the original Hamiltonian cycle problem? The decision question is the same. To put it differently, what is the difference between NP and co-NP here?</p>

<p>Otherwise, if this complementary version is false, what would be the correct version (if any exists)?</p></div>

<p>There are several papers that propose that the universe itself is analogous to a cellular automata. Obviously, these papers assume that the universe is computable.</p>

<p>But is it there any cosmological cellular automata models that would allow uncomputable laws/processes/functions/numbers/things...etc to exist in that universe? For example, cellular automata universes where there would be truly black hole-singularities (which are uncomputable)?</p>

<p>Maybe Konrad Zuse's cellular automata could do the job? </p>

<p>I am a mid-stage theoretical computer science student. Although I have a busy schedule, I still have a one or one a half hour in a day which I devote to reading and solving the question given Jeff Erickson's lecture note etc. I am doing this thing from many months and wondering. Is this a right thing for me to do in free time as now I am a Ph.D. student not an undergraduate student. Now why I do this to become more strong in an algorithm, discrete maths etc part. Another thing which seems more valuable to me is to read more and more research paper of my research domain as my goal after my Ph.D. is to publish more quality research papers in the field related to my current field. I am wondering which one is better or suggest anything else which may be more valuable to me keeping my future perspective in mind.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What to do as a Theoretical computer science PhD student in free time? I am wondering what star experienced researchers do in their time ( assuming they have a free time ).</p>

<p>Some of my free time I also spent on watching video lecture of workshops related to my field.</p></div>

<div class="content">
<p>Apologies in advance for the slightly general question - I'm really looking for pointers to research / good keywords to look for.</p>

<p>I have a problem with the following setup: I have a (finite) totally ordered set <span class="math-container">$(T, \leq)$</span> and a set of functions <span class="math-container">$f_i: T \to T$</span> that are non-increasing (i.e. <span class="math-container">$f_i(t) \leq t$</span>). I know at least one point <span class="math-container">$t \in T$</span> but in general I only have access to <span class="math-container">$T$</span> via membership queries, that starting point, and the <span class="math-container">$f_i$</span>.</p>

<p>I am looking for any point <span class="math-container">$t_{min}$</span> which is a simultaneous fixed point of all of the <span class="math-container">$f_i$</span>. Obviously I can find this by just calculating <span class="math-container">$(f_1 \ldots f_n)^k(t)$</span> for our starting point <span class="math-container">$t \in T$</span> (note: This wouldn't be true if the <span class="math-container">$f_i$</span> could increase their argument).</p>

<p>My question is this: Given some (in general non-uniform, but I'd be happy for an answer that assumes the same cost for each as a starting point) cost model for the <span class="math-container">$f_i$</span>, how do I find such a <span class="math-container">$t_{\min}$</span> with a small cost of reaching it in terms of total cost of the <span class="math-container">$f_i$</span> invocations to get to that point?</p>

<p>There are lots of obvious heuristics one can apply, but it's not obvious which ones are good, and of the ones I've tried whether they work well or not seems to depend massively on the shape of the problem and the effectiveness of individual <span class="math-container">$f_i$</span>.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, in my particular use case, the following seem to usually be true:</p>

<ul>
<li>Especially after a few iterations, most points are likely to be fixed points of most of the <span class="math-container">$f_i$</span>.</li>
<li>It is much more likely that <span class="math-container">$f_i^2(s) = f_i(s)$</span> than that <span class="math-container">$f_j(f_i(s)) = f_i(s)$</span> for <span class="math-container">$j \neq i$</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other things that might be helpful:</p>

<ul>
<li>In my concrete use case, <span class="math-container">$T$</span> is a set of strings over some ordered alphabet, with <span class="math-container">$\leq$</span> being the shortlex order (i.e. <span class="math-container">$s \leq t$</span> if <span class="math-container">$|s| &lt; |t|$</span> or <span class="math-container">$|s| = |t|$</span> and <span class="math-container">$s$</span> is lexicographically before <span class="math-container">$t$</span>).</li>
<li>I can sample uniformly at random from <span class="math-container">$T$</span>, and my initial <span class="math-container">$t$</span> comes from that distribution, but sampling is typically much more expensive than individual <span class="math-container">$f_i$</span> invocations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Are there any good heuristics/metaheuristics I should be looking at for this class of problem?</p></div>

<div class="content">
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am mostly unfamiliar with theoretical computer science, making it hard for me to navigate literature in the field. I ask the following out of curiosity.</p>

<p><strong>Background/Motivation:</strong> Coming from information theory, I recently learned about a connection of entropy and Kolmogorov complexity: Loosely speaking, entropy of a random variable is the expected rate at which the Kolmogorov complexity of a long sample sequence increases per sample. <a href="http://www.cs-114.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Elements_of_Information_Theory_Elements.pdf" rel="noreferrer">[Elements of Information Theory, p. 154]</a> Kolmogorov complexity can therefore capture the notion of entropy, but it is more general than that. Hereby, and in the following, whenever I write complexity, I implicitly refer to the complexity given the length of the output.</p>

<p>For non-zero entropy, the Kolmogorov complexity of initial segments of an infinite sequence of samples from a random variable is therefore unbounded. I was wondering whether this is equivalent to the fact that an infinite sequence of samples is uncomputable. This led me to the hypothesis in the title: Is a binary sequence computable if and only if the Kolmogorov complexity of its initial segments is bounded?</p>

<p>If the hypothesis was true, then computability could be understood as an indicator that the "amount of information" in a sequence is finite. In some sense, the initial segment complexities would allow a more finely graded characterization of infinite sequences than just "computable" and "uncomputable". We could get a notion of "information content" and "information rate" of infinite sequences by analyzing the size of the bound or, in the unbounded case, the rate/type of growth, as in the entropy case above. My question boils down to whether "computable" and "uncomputable" are regions on this scale.</p>

<p>If the hypothesis is true, I'd be interested in whether this perspective is useful for TCS research. If yes, are there references elaborating this idea? If not, why not?</p>

<p><strong>What I found in literature:</strong> It is shown that a sequence is Martin-Löf random iff there is a constant <span class="math-container">$c$</span> so that there are infinitely many initial segments with complexity greater than <span class="math-container">$n - c$</span> where <span class="math-container">$n$</span> is the segment length. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0110086.pdf" rel="noreferrer">[Randomness, p. 18]</a></p>

<p>This means that random sequences have unbounded initial segment complexity. Since they are not computable, the hypothesis is true at least for this case. If I am not mistaken, a similar argument could even be made for a weaker form of randomness, since Mises-Wald-Church random sequences cannot have initial segment complexity of O(log n). <a href="https://www.math.uni-heidelberg.de/logic/merkle/ps/JCSS-stoch.pdf" rel="noreferrer">[The complexity of stochastic sequences]</a></p>

<p><strong>What's missing for a proof:</strong></p>

<p><span class="math-container">$\Leftarrow$</span>:
Assume a sequence is computable. We know that a program <code>generate_bit(n)</code> exists that generates any bit of the sequence. Now, we can build a program <code>generate_initial_segment(n) = concat(map(1..n, generate_bit))</code> that, given the segment length <span class="math-container">$n$</span>, generates the initial segment up to position n by invoking <code>generate_bit</code> <span class="math-container">$n$</span> times and concatenating the results. The Kolmogorov complexity of this task is therefore bounded by the length of this program. ☐</p>

<p><span class="math-container">$\Rightarrow$</span>: I struggle to prove/disprove this direction, namely: If initial segment complexity is bounded, is a sequence always computable?</p></div>

<p>I have a treat with which to impress your friends at New Year’s Eve parties tomorrow night: a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/incompleteness.pdf">rollicking essay</a> graciously contributed by a reader named Sebastian Oberhoff, about a unified and simplified way to prove all of Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems, as well as Rosser’s Theorem, directly in terms of computer programs.  In particular, this improves over my treatments in <em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em> and my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=710">Rosser’s Theorem via Turing machines</a> post.  While there won’t be anything new here for the experts, I loved the style—indeed, it brings back wistful memories of how <em>I</em> used to write, before I accumulated too many imaginary (and non-imaginary) readers tut-tutting at crass jokes over my shoulder.  May 2019 bring us all the time and the courage to express ourselves authentically, even in ways that might be sneered at as incomplete, inconsistent, or unsound.</p></div>

<p>The inherent property of nature- pure randomness may be generated. I'd like a proof in either direction, if a program cannot do such a thing.</p>

<p>As far as my thinking goes a program is undecidable but at the same time how could it be deterministic enough to not generate pure quantum randomness?</p>

<p>But the final truth that it can or cannot generate quantum randomness must be surely decidable.</p></div>

This 448-page textbook evolved out of a subset of the algorithms lecture notes I've been maintaining for about 20 years.</p>
<p>There are still a few more steps before this becomes an actual paper book—most notably an index—but I wanted to get this out the door this year. I expect to publish the actual paper book in a few weeks; it will also be licensed CC-BY.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I've set up an issue-tracker on Github where anyone can report errors or provide other feedback.</p>
<p>The book site also includes copies of the lecture notes that I left out of the book (because I wanted a finite book in a finite amount of time), along with a complete archive of old homeworks, exams, lab handouts, and the like.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>In this paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1407" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1407</a>, the author proposes to study the universe (and possibly multiverses) through computer simulations of universes.</p>

<p>But there's one thing I still don't understand. </p>

<p>The paper proposes to study the evolution of these universes through a "Cosmic Evolution Equation”
The author defines a set of possible universes to study their evolution through simulations, but in that set there's a group of universes that obey different logic systems or eve do not obey any kind of logic (it uses Ellis' classification of possible universes, including illogical/logically impossible ones). The paper says that we can study all these universes with the method it proposes (through simulations and Cosmic Evolution Equation). But the logically impossible/illogical universes that the paper proposes wouldn't be uncomputable? Wouldn't they be impossible to study?</p>

<p>How can these types of universes be studied? Could they be simulated through some kind of hypercomputation? </p></div>

<p>What happens if we define <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPAD_(complexity)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><span class="math-container">${\bf PPAD}$</span></a> such that instead of a polytime Turing-machine/polysize circuit, a (non-)deterministic finite/push-down automaton encodes the problem? </p>

<p>I asked a similar <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/27074/does-bf-ac0pad-bf-ppad">question</a> four years ago, but I expect the answer to be different.</p>

<p>To give a concrete example, consider End-Of-The-Line in a grid (known to be PPAD-complete); here a digraph <span class="math-container">$G_n$</span> on <span class="math-container">$2^n\times 2^n$</span>, with arcs going only between some neighboring grid-points, is encoded by a machine, such that <span class="math-container">$(0,0)$</span> has no in-neighbor and only one out-neighbor, and our goal is to find another vertex of odd degree. We make a CFLPAD problem from it as follows. Fix a PDA. On any input <span class="math-container">$(x,y)$</span> of length <span class="math-container">$n$</span>, the PDA should return the in- and out-neighbors of the grid-vertex <span class="math-container">$(x,y)$</span> of <span class="math-container">$G_n$</span>. So how hard is it to find another odd vertex (with the PDA and <span class="math-container">$n$</span> as input)?</p></div>

We explore the power of interactive proofs with a distributed verifier. In this setting, the verifier consists of $n$ nodes and a graph $G$ that defines their communication pattern. The prover is a single entity that communicates with all nodes by short messages. The goal is to verify that the graph $G$ belongs to some language in a small number of rounds, and with small communication bound, i.e., the proof size.

This interactive model was introduced by Kol, Oshman and Saxena (PODC 2018) as a generalization of non-interactive distributed proofs. They demonstrated the power of interaction in this setting by constructing protocols for problems as Graph Symmetry and Graph Non-Isomorphism -- both of which require proofs of $\Omega(n^2)$-bits without interaction.

In this work, we provide a new general framework for distributed interactive proofs that allows one to translate standard interactive protocols (i.e., with a centralized verifier) to ones where the verifier is distributed with a proof size that depends on the computational complexity of the verification algorithm run by the centralized verifier.
We show the following:

* Every (centralized) computation that can be performed in time $O(n)$ can be translated into three-round distributed interactive protocol with $O(\log n)$ proof size. This implies that many graph problems for sparse graphs have succinct proofs (e.g., testing planarity).

* Every (centralized) computation implemented by either a small space or by uniform NC circuit can be translated into a distributed protocol with $O(1)$ rounds and $O(\log n)$ bits proof size for the low space case and $polylog(n)$ many rounds and proof size for NC.

* We also demonstrate the power of our compilers for problems not captured by the above families. We show that for Graph Non-Isomorphism, one of the striking demonstrations of the power of interaction, there is a 4-round protocol with $O(\log n)$ proof size, improving upon the $O(n \log n)$ proof size of Kol et al.

* For many problems we show how to reduce proof size below the naturally seeming barrier of $\log n$. By employing our RAM compiler, we get a 5-round protocols with proof size $O(\log \log n)$ for a family of problems including Fixed Automorphism, Clique and Leader Election (for the later two problems we actually get $O(1)$ proof size).

* Finally we discuss how to make these proofs non-interactive arguments via random oracles.

Our compilers capture many natural problems and demonstrates the difficultly in showing lower bounds in these regimes.</div>

Knecht Ruprecht accompanies Santa Claus in Germany. He brings gifts to good children but lumps of coal to naughty ones. He is regarded more generally as the German counterpart to England’s Robin Goodfellow, aka. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puck_(folklore)">Puck</a>. The Simpsons’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa's_Little_Helper">dog</a> “Santa’s Little Helper” is named “Knecht Ruprecht” in the show’s German edition.</p>
<p>
Today we do a nice-or-naughty riff on technological gifts suggested by yesterday’s ACM TechNews mailing.</p>
<p>
The ACM mailings highlight the achievements of the whole field: from quantum to everything else. We thought it might be fun to be a bit puckish ourselves and deliver some “coal” to ACM. The stories can be sometimes a bit much. We hope that all involved are in good spirits and accept the “coal” as a holiday-inspired gift—with some echo of the general discussion about naughty-or-nice effects of tech advances.</p>

Mighty News<br />
December 19, 2018<br />
Researchers from a university consortium have developed an open source system delivering fast, precise neural decoding and real-time readouts of where CS faculty think they are. The neural decoding software decrypts hippocampal spatiotemporal patterns detected from tetrode recordings without requiring spike sorting, an error-prone computational process. Implementing this software on a graphical processing unit (GPU) chip demonstrated a 20- to 50-fold upgrade in decoding and analysis speed over conventional multicore central processing unit (CPU) chips. This builds on work previous done on rats as reported by ACM previously. The lab director says that the CS faculty work presented many challenges beyond that required for rats. The applications—she says—are immense. Faculty currently cannot always tell where they are, and the new system could help them get to classes on time.</p>

December 19, 2018 <br />
Researchers at Can’t-Abridge University have for the first time taught a robotic hand to type on a normal keyboard. The researchers claim that their system can type at rates in excess of 20 words per minute. They say, “this could change the way that computers interact with others.” The system, which now weighs about 500 pounds, could be reduced in size and cost in the future. That the robot sometimes destroys the keys by hitting them too hard continues to be a challenge.</p>

December 19, 2018<br />
Engineers at the University of St. Anford have located every solar panel in the contiguous U.S. via a network built around a deep learning computer model called Inception. The network completed this task in less than a month, ascertaining that regions with more sun exposure had greater solar panel adoption than areas with less average sunlight. DeepSolar also learned that adoption was higher in locations of increasing average household income. Unbelievable—who would have guessed this?</p>

ScienceAlarm <br />
December 21, 2018<br />
Researchers at Knockout University in Japan gave an assistant professorship to a “true slime mold” amoeba, and found as the papers-per-year target increased from four to eight, the single-celled organism only needed a linear amount of more time to generate minimum publishable units. This is part of an ongoing project on using lower-level organisms to do research. The project previously used graduate students. The leader of the multiple institution project said that using amoebae could reduce the costs of writing up research by up to 50%. He also said that the amoeba sometimes made various grammar errors, but that the project was attempting to fix this issue.</p>

Researchers at TKO University in Japan gave the Traveling Salesman Problem (TPS) to a vast array of noisy astronomical scale quantum (NASQ) processors, and found that as the cities increased from four to eight, the system only needed a linear amount of more time to determine a single reasonable route. This was fresh off its success at factoring numbers higher than 291,311 = 523*557 that it didn’t even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization_records#Records_for_efforts_by_quantum_computers">know</a> it was factoring. TPS is an optimization problem requiring a computer to look at a list of cities and determine the shortest route in which each city is visited exactly once. The team said their results “may lead to the development of quantum algorithms for problems on as many as ten cities.” </p>

C++ News<br />
December 19, 2018<br />
The <b>std::pair</b> construct in C++ is a common annoyance because human programmers frequently forget its implicit presence when iterating over maps or inserting into sets. This necessitates the re-typing of millions of lines of source code per annum. Absent the development of a robotic hand able to type at a desktop keyboard at 20 words per minute, software companies can improve productivity by optimizing the nutritional intake of programmers. Nanosoft has partnered with CodeURIKA to provide protein-rich drinks worldwide, after a study of electronic sweatshops found that proteins minimize both syntactic and semantic bugs better over the long term than sugars and PEDs. </p>

Wallbanger Street Journal<br />
December 19, 2018<br />
The Lite House hotelier is experimenting with an algorithmic pricing system to set different room rates for guests who arrive in self-driving cars. Once customers book for the first time at a standard rate, they fill out a questionnaire of 200 questions to specify how often they will need the car, how frequently they visit the hotel bar, and other details. The hotelier then activates a key to drive the car into an appropriate space. The optimized use of vertical space and savings from not hiring car valets will enable conference participants who are not staying at the hotel to park there at a rate low enough to include in the conference registration fee. A spokesman said, “Most of the big hotel operating companies are not focused on their conference guests,” while Lite House’s algorithmic rate-setting “is next-generation.”</p>

ESPN Technology Review<br />
December 20, 2018.<br />
Major corporations like Wallstore, ChippedPot, and Horizon are using virtual reality (VR) to prepare employees for potentially difficult situations on the job. For example, Horizon has more than 1,600 stores in the U.S. whose front-line employees participate in a digital scenario in which a customer asks to use the bathroom. In a “Harry Potter-Style Photos for Muggles” twist, researchers have developed software that can animate the central character in a photograph while leaving the rest of the image untouched. Its skeleton can then be animated to create the sense of movement, solving the problem of pose estimation for a limited set of circumstances in which bathroom requests occur. </p>

TubeNet<br />
December 19, 2018<br />
A team of researchers from Burning Man University has developed a new side-channel attack that exploits the heat generated by people wearing Orange Digital Watches while working on their PCs. Heat amplifies the watches’ ability to detect keystrokes from both hands. Videos known to generate large amounts of heat include comic videos and videos on carpet cleaning. The attack becomes more adept at guessing correct keys as the user gets hotter, as it amasses more key presses from graphic libraries. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/open/cycles.html">motorcycle graph</a> is a geometric structure devised by Jeff Erickson as a simplified model for the behavior of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_skeleton">straight skeletons</a>, motivated by the light cycle game in the movie Tron. Its initial data consists of a set of points in the plane (the motorcycles), each with an initial velocity. The motorcycles leave a trail behind them as they move, and a motorcycle crashes (stopping the growth of its trail) when it hits the trail of another motorcycle.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2018/motorcycle-graph.svg" alt="A motorcycle graph" /></p>

<p>The motorcycles can be constrained in various ways, and one of these constrained variants is much older. It’s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_tessellation">Gilbert tessellation</a>, a motorcycle graph in which the motorcycles start out in pairs traveling in opposite directions, all at the same speed, with a random initial placement for the pairs. Edgar Gilbert wrote about it in 1967, as a model for the growth of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acicular_(crystal_habit)">acicular (needle-shaped) crystals</a> and similar systems.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gilbert_tessellation.svg"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2018/Gilbert-tessellation.svg" alt="A Gilbert tessellation, by Claudio Rocchini" /></a></p>

<p>One obvious difference between the Gilbert tessellation and more general types of motorcycle graph is that all the Gilbert tessellation cells are convex polygons. More general motorcycle graphs leave degree-one vertices at the starting position of each motorcycle, but this is hidden by the way the Gilbert graph starts motorcycles in pairs. If we constrain the motorcycles even more, to travel in axis-parallel directions, the polygons become rectangles.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gilbert_tessellation_axis.svg"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2018/Gilbert-rectangles.svg" alt="Axis-aligned Gilbert tessellation subdivides the plane into rectangles, by Claudio Rocchini" /></a></p>

<p>In my paper “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.2890">Growth and decay in life-like cellular automata</a>” I noticed that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-like_cellular_automaton">Life-like cellular automaton</a> rule B017/S1 has a very simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicator_(cellular_automaton)">replicator</a> consisting of two orthogonally-adjacent live cells, and that initial fields consisting of very sparse randomly placed live cells become dominated by rows and columns of these replicators. Here’s an example for an initial random fill density of 1%, the lowest I can go in <a href="http://golly.sourceforge.net/">Golly</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2018/b017s1.png" alt="Replicator chaos in B017/S1" /></p>

<p>Although I didn’t notice it at the time, this looks very similar to the rectangular Gilbert tessellation! I think that’s not a coincidence. With a fill density of , the most common constellation (connected group of live cells) of the initial configuration will be a single live cell, with density (number of constellations per unit area) approximately  . But the isolated cells all die off immediately. The second most common constellations,  with density , have two live cells. If the two cells are diagonally adjacent, they form a small oscillator, and if they are orthogonally adjacent, they form a replicator. The replicators will then grow either horizontally or vertically in both directions until they run into something, usually (but not always) another replicator. When two replicators collide, they tend to form a stable blob that blocks both of them. The one that was there first will usually (but not always) have copies of itself on both sides of the blob, so its line of copies stays more or less unchanged in place. The replicator that arrives second will usually (but not always) be blocked by the first replicator, and stay on one side of the collision point. And when replicators are bounded on both sides by stable blobs, they usually (but not always) turn into stable oscillators, continuing to fill the line they have already marked out. If all of the usual things always happened, we would get a Gilbert tessellation; instead, we get something that looks a lot like a Gilbert tessellation but with typically a constant number of oscillators in its rectangles and with occasional other differences from the expected behavior.</p>

<p>Could this happen for sparse initial conditions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a>? Maybe!</p>

<p>In a sequence of papers from 1998 to his 2010 “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-84996-217-9_20">Emergent Complexity in Conway’s Game of Life</a>”, Nick Gotts has explored the behavior of random Life initial conditions, in the limit as the fill density  goes to zero. We don’t know what happens to these patterns in the long term, but we can say something rigorous about their behavior in the short and medium terms. Here, by “short term” I mean what happens after a constant number of steps, and by “medium term” I mean a number of steps that’s polynomial in  with a small-enough exponent.</p>

<p>Initially, near most points of the plane, the nearest objects will be isolated cells, spaced  units from each other (the inverse square root of their density). However, these immediately die off. So in the short term, the nearest objects will usually be “blonks” (blinkers and blocks, generated from initial constellations of three live cells), with density  and spacing . More widely scattered are gliders, either generated directly from constellations of five initial live cells, or from <a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/R-pentomino">R pentominos</a> which create a bounded number of gliders before stabilizing. Both possibilities give the gliders density . Even more widely scattered, at density , are the simplest patterns that produce infinite growth rather than stability or simple motion: the <a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Block-laying_switch_engine">block-laying switch engines</a>, generated from initial constellations of ten live cells. These are puffer trains rather than replicators: they have a single live head that lays down a trail of blocks as it moves.</p>

<p>If the field stayed like this throughout the medium term, things would be boring. The gliders and switch engines would typically crash into blonks in  steps, in most cases stopping their motion. And so one might expect that at numbers of steps with higher exponents, most points would have only stable or low-period debris as their nearest live pattern. Occasionally there would be a trail of a crashed and dead switch engine but these would be very far apart, at a typical distance , compared to their typical length of . So from a high-level point of view, these trails would just look like randomly placed line segments rather than forming anything like a motorcycle graph or Gilbert tessellation.</p>

<p>However, what Gotts discovered is that something much more complicated and confusing happens. The gliders (with short-term density ) start crashing into blonks, but when they do they sometimes produce one or more new gliders. Those gliders, in turn, might crash into something else and produce even more gliders, perhaps including some that return to the previous crash site. Gotts defines a “standard collision sequence” to be a sequence of events of this type, involving a single initial glider and a widely scattered collection of blonks. There are finitely many different standard collision sequences that involve a given number  of initial blonks. Any one of these sequences can happen to a given glider with a probability that tends to a constant as the number of time steps goes to , the expected time for any glider to complete its collision sequence in the absence of interactions with the crash debris of other gliders.</p>

<p>But the crash debris starts to add up, preventing this analysis from actually staying valid all the way to that limiting point. In particular, some standard collision sequences can produce infinite growth patterns like the block-laying switch engine. If we ignored interactions with other gliders and just considered standard collision sequences, it would appear that the density of switch engines constructed in this way would approach  as the number of time steps went to , and therefore that the density of blocks in switch engine trails would approach , much more dense than the density of initial blonks. That can’t happen, and our analysis breaks down. What’s less clear and not rigorously proven is exactly how it breaks down.</p>

<p>One possibility for the breakdown is the following. Switch engines or other puffer engines start being produced in increasing density by standard collision sequences, and they start growing trails of blocks behind them. As their trails grow and the typical distance between the puffers shrinks, at some point these two distances cross over, and the trails become longer than the typical distance. This crossover distance is well below the  distance one would expect a puffer to travel before hitting an initial blonk. Once this happens, most puffers will crash into the trail of another puffer, and their trails will divide up space into something resembling a motorcycle graph. (It’s not a Gilbert tessellation, because each puffer starts out moving in a single direction.) The cells of this graph prevent anything else from moving across it, leading to eventual stabilization.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that some other pattern (perhaps initial or perhaps produced by a standard collision sequence) does something quickly enough to disrupt the creation of a motorcycle graph before it happens, or breaks through it after it is constructed. We don’t know what these patterns might look like, but we also don’t know that they don’t exist. Life patterns can do complicated things. Because so much is still unknown, what Gotts actually proves is more cautious: either infinite-growth patterns created from collision sequences eventually cause the total population to be significantly denser than its original density, or the infinite-growth patterns created through standard collision sequences will themselves become more dense than they were in the initial field.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math-container">$D$</span> be an <span class="math-container">$\epsilon$</span>-biased distribution we want to show that
<span class="math-container">$$\text{Supp}(D)\geq \Omega\bigg(\frac{n}{\epsilon^2\log(\frac{1}{\epsilon})}\bigg)$$</span>
I know that there are some proofs for this but I am intrested in the following particular way.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math-container">$X,Y$</span> be two distributions over <span class="math-container">$\{0,1\}^n$</span>. Consider the "convolution" of distributions <span class="math-container">$Z=X\circledast Y$</span> to be defined by sampling <span class="math-container">$x\sim X$</span> and <span class="math-container">$y\sim Y$</span> <strong>independently</strong> and outputting <span class="math-container">$x\oplus y$</span> where <span class="math-container">$\oplus$</span> is just bit-wise xor.</p>

<p>Now if we define a distribution <span class="math-container">$D^{(t)}=D\circledast\cdots\circledast D$</span> (<span class="math-container">$t$</span> times) we can use some Fourier analysis and combinatorics to show that</p>

<ol>
<li><span class="math-container">$D^{(t)}$</span> is <span class="math-container">$\epsilon^t$</span>-biased.</li>
<li><span class="math-container">$|\text{Supp}(D^{(t)})|\leq\binom{|\text{Supp}(D)|+t}{t}$</span></li>
</ol>

<p>We can also show that for every <span class="math-container">$\delta$</span>-biased distribution <span class="math-container">$Z$</span> we have <span class="math-container">$\lVert Z\rVert_2^2\leq\delta^2+2^{-n}$</span> when considering the distribution as a vector of probabilities. Now, I was told that I can use the latter to obtain a lower bound on <span class="math-container">$|\text{Supp}(D^{(t)})|$</span> and then choose <span class="math-container">$t$</span> accordingly to get the desired bound.</p>

<p>However, the only bound I can get for <span class="math-container">$|\text{Supp}(D^{(t)})|$</span> is 
<span class="math-container">$$|\text{Supp}(D^{(t)})|\geq\sqrt{\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2t}+2^{-n}}}$$</span>
And I don't see how that helps... </p></div>

<p>A set of words over a finite alphabet is <em>prefix-free</em> if there are no two distinct words where one is a prefix of the other.</p>

<p>The question is: </p>

<p><strong>What is the complexity of checking whether a regular language given as an NFA contains an infinite prefix-free subset?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer (due to Mikhail Rudoy, here below)</strong>: It can be done in polynomial time, and I think in even in NL. </p>

<p>Paraphrasing Mikhail's answer, let <span class="math-container">$(\Sigma,q_0,F,\delta)$</span> be the input NFA in the normal form (no epsilon transitions, trim), and let <span class="math-container">$L[p,r]$</span> (resp. <span class="math-container">$L[p,R]$</span>) be the language obtained by having state <span class="math-container">$r$</span> as initial state and <span class="math-container">$\{s\}$</span> as final state (resp. state <span class="math-container">$r$</span> as inital and the set <span class="math-container">$S$</span> as final). For a word <span class="math-container">$u$</span> let <span class="math-container">$u^\omega$</span> be the infinite word obtained by iterating <span class="math-container">$u$</span>.</p>

<p>The following are equivalent:</p>

<ol>
<li>The language <span class="math-container">$L[q_0,F]$</span> contains an infinite prefix-free subset.</li>
<li><span class="math-container">$\exists q \in Q$</span>, <span class="math-container">$\exists u \in L[q,q]$</span> <span class="math-container">$\exists v \in L[q,F]$</span> so that <span class="math-container">$v$</span> is not a prefix of <span class="math-container">$u^\omega$</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math-container">$\exists q \in Q$</span> <span class="math-container">$L[q,q] \neq \emptyset$</span> <span class="math-container">$\forall u \in L[q,q]$</span> <span class="math-container">$\exists v \in L[q,F]$</span> so that <span class="math-container">$v$</span> is not a prefix of <span class="math-container">$u^\omega$</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Proof:</p>

<p>3<span class="math-container">$\Rightarrow$</span>2 trivial.</p>

<p>For 2<span class="math-container">$\Rightarrow$</span>1, it suffices to see that for any <span class="math-container">$w \in L[q_0,q]$</span> we have that <span class="math-container">$w (u^{|v|})^* v$</span> is an infinite prefix-free subset of <span class="math-container">$L[q_0,F]$</span>.</p>

<p>Finally, 1<span class="math-container">$\Rightarrow$</span>3 is the "correctness" proof in Mikhail's answer.</p></div>

We study the question of algebraic rank or transcendence degree preserving homomorphisms over finite fields. This concept was first introduced by Beecken, Mittmann and Saxena (Information and Computing, 2013), and exploited by them, and Agrawal, Saha, Saptharishi and Saxena (Journal of Computing, 2016) to design algebraic independence based identity tests using the Jacobian criterion over characteristic zero fields. An analogue of such constructions over finite characteristic fields was unknown due to the failure of the Jacobian criterion over finite characteristic fields.
Building on a recent criterion of Pandey, Sinhababu and Saxena (MFCS, 2016), we construct explicit faithful maps for some natural classes of polynomials in the positive characteristic field setting, when a certain parameter called the inseparable degree of the underlying polynomials is bounded (this parameter is always 1 in fields of characteristic zero). This presents the first generalisation of some of the results of Beecken et al. and Agrawal et al. in the positive characteristic setting.</div>

<p>COMBINATORIAL LEFSCHETZ THEOREMS BEYOND POSITIVITY</p>
<p>by Karim Adiprasito</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Consider a simplicial complex that allows for an embedding into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb R^d" class="latex" title="\mathbb R^d" />. How many faces of dimension <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d/2" class="latex" title="d/2" /> or higher can it have? How dense can they be?</p>
<p>This basic question goes back to Descartes. Using it and other fundamental combinatorial<br />
problems, we will introduce a version of the Kähler package beyond positivity,<br />
allowing us to prove the Lefschetz theorem for toric varieties even when the ample<br />
cone is empty. A particular focus lies on replacing the Hodge-Riemann relations by a<br />
non-degeneracy relation at torus-invariant subspaces, allowing us to state and prove a<br />
generalization of the theorems of Hall and Laman in the setting of toric varieties. Of<br />
the many applications, we highlight two main applications, one because it is the most<br />
well-known, the other because it provided the most guiding light.</p>
<p>(1) We fully characterize the possible face numbers of simplicial spheres, resolving the<br />
so called <em>g</em>-conjecture of McMullen in full generality and generalizing Stanley’s<br />
earlier proof for simplicial polytopes.</p>
<p>(2) We prove that for a simplicial complex <em>K</em> that embeds into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5E%7B2d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb R^{2d}" class="latex" title="\mathbb R^{2d}" />, the number of <em>d</em>-dimensional simplices exceeds the number of <em>(d − 1)</em>-dimensional simplices by a factor of at most <em>d + 2</em>. This generalizes a result of Descartes, and resolves the Grünbaum-Kalai-Sarkaria conjecture.</p>
<p>_______</p>
<p>(GK:) A few further comments. Probably the <em>g</em>-conjecture for spheres is the single problem I knock my head against the most. It is great to see it settled and it is even greater to see it settled by my friend and colleague Karim Adiprasito.</p>
<p>To the three ingredients of the standard conjectures (See also the <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/12/24/icm-2018-rio-4-huh-balog-morris-wormald/">previous post</a>), Poincare duality <strong>(PD</strong>), Hard Lefschetz (<strong>HL</strong>) and Hodge-Riemann (<strong>HR</strong>), Karim adds the <strong>Hall-Laman relations</strong>. Very roughly, the Hall-Laman relations  substitute<strong> (HR)</strong> and apply genericity (rather than definiteness) toward <strong>(HL)</strong>.</p>
<p>(We still need a good acronym for Hall-Laman, maybe <strong>(AHL)</strong>.)</p>
<p>One very nice feature of Karim’s proof is that <strong>vertex decomposable</strong> spheres play a special role in the path toward the proof. Those were introduced by Provan and Billera in the context of the Hirsch conjecture.</p>
<p>We have devoted <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/tag/g-conjecture/">plenty of posts</a> to the <em>g</em>-conjecture for spheres, and mentioned it in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/page/2/?s=g-conjecture">even more posts</a>.  For an introduction to the conjecture see <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2009/04/02/eran-nevo-the-g-conjecture-i/">Eran Nevo introductory post</a>, and the post <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2009/04/04/how-the-g-conjecture-came-about/" rel="bookmark">How the g-Conjecture Came About</a>. There is also plenty left to be done <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/06/20/beyond-the-g-conjecture-algebraic-combinatorics-of-cellular-spaces-i/">beyond the g-conjecture</a>.</p>
