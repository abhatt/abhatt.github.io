</p>
<p>We present an approach for devising a deterministic polynomial time blackbox
identity testing (PIT) algorithm for depth-$4$ circuits with bounded top fanin.
This approach is similar to Kayal-Shubhangi approach for depth-$3$ circuits.
Kayal and Shubhangi based their algorithm on Sylvester-Gallai-type theorem
about linear polynomials. We show how it is possible to generalize this
approach to depth-$4$ circuits. However we failed to implement this plan
completely. We succeeded to construct a polynomial time deterministic algorithm
for depth-$4$ circuits with bounded top fanin and its correctness requires a
hypothesis. Also we present a polynomial-time (unconditional) algorithm for
some subclass of depth-$4$ circuits with bounded top fanin.

of Topological Data Analysis. However, using these diagrams in conjunction with
machine learning techniques requires some mathematical finesse. The most
success to date has come from finding methods for turning persistence diagrams
into vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ in a way which preserves as much of the space of
persistence diagrams as possible, commonly referred to as featurization. In
this paper, we describe a mathematical framework for featurizing the
persistence diagram space using template functions. These functions are general
as they are only required to be continuous, have a compact support, and
separate points. We discuss two example realizations of these functions: tent
functions and Chybeyshev interpolating polynomials. Both of these functions are
defined on a grid superposed on the birth-lifetime plane. We then combine the
resulting features with machine learning algorithms to perform supervised
classification and regression on several example data sets, including manifold
data, shape data, and an embedded time series from a Rossler system. Our
results show that the template function approach yields high accuracy rates
that match and often exceed the results of existing methods for featurizing
persistence diagrams. One counter-intuitive observation is that in most cases
using interpolating polynomials, where each point contributes globally to the
feature vector, yields significantly better results than using tent functions,
where the contribution of each point is localized to its grid cell. Along the
way, we also provide a complete characterization of compact sets in persistence
diagram space endowed with the bottleneck distance.

rely on construction of an automaton with quasi-polynomial number of states
that separates specific languages of infinite words. This motivates a question
of whether a matching quasi-polynomial lower bound on the number of states can
be proved. This would mean impossibility for a separation approach to give
a~polynomial-time algorithm for Parity Games.
</p>
<p>In this paper we study a restricted version of the problem. We bound the
number of moves to be read by a separation automaton before it makes a
decision. In the general problem there is no restriction of this sort. But we
show that lower bounds for unrestricted version of the problem are related to
lower bounds for a restricted one with some explicit bound on the number of
moves.
</p>
<p>We apply communication complexity techniques to get an exponential lower
bound on the number of states of a separation automata which makes a decision
after reading linear number of moves.
</p>
<p>We also prove an exponential lower bound on the number of states of any
deterministic automaton which outputs any repetition in an infinite string
after reading some finite prefix of it. The motivation of this result in
context of separation automata is discussed in a paper.
</p>
<p>Finally, we show an upper bound on a communication problem that we call
Inevitable Intersection problem. Using this upper bound we conclude that a
certain class of reductions from communication complexity are unable to show
super-polynomial lower bounds on separation automata.

general circuits, and is known to be asymptotically optimal in the exponent
when $d &lt; n^{\epsilon}$ for a small enough constant $\epsilon$. Our upper bound
matches the lower bound of $\exp\left({\Omega\left(\sqrt{n\log

is tight and cannot be improved to $o\left(\left(n/\log

an undirected, unweighted graph such that the distance between any pair of
vertices can be decoded solely from their labels. An important class of
distance labeling schemes is that of hub labelings, where a node $v \in G$
stores its distance to the so-called hubs $S_v \subseteq V$, chosen so that for
any $u,v \in V$ there is $w \in S_u \cap S_v$ belonging to some shortest $uv$
path. Notice that for most existing graph classes, the best distance labelling
constructions existing use at some point a hub labeling scheme at least as a
key building block. Our interest lies in hub labelings of sparse graphs, i.e.,
those with $|E(G)| = O(n)$, for which we show a lowerbound of
$\frac{n}{2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})}}$ for the average size of the hubsets.
Additionally, we show a hub-labeling construction for sparse graphs of average
size $O(\frac{n}{RS(n)^{c}})$ for some $0 &lt; c &lt; 1$, where $RS(n)$ is the
so-called Ruzsa-Szemer{\'e}di function, linked to structure of induced
matchings in dense graphs. This implies that further improving the lower bound
on hub labeling size to $\frac{n}{2^{(\log n)^{o(1)}}}$ would require a
breakthrough in the study of lower bounds on $RS(n)$, which have resisted
substantial improvement in the last 70 years. For general distance labeling of
sparse graphs, we show a lowerbound of $\frac{1}{2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})}}
SumIndex(n)$, where $SumIndex(n)$ is the communication complexity of the
Sum-Index problem over $Z_n$. Our results suggest that the best achievable
hub-label size and distance-label size in sparse graphs may be
$\Theta(\frac{n}{2^{(\log n)^c}})$ for some $0&lt;c &lt; 1$.

the special case when the highway dimension is 1, for which we present a
fully-polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS). We also prove that STP is
weakly NP-hard for these restricted graphs. For TSP we show NP-hardness for
graphs of highway dimension 6, which answers an open problem posed in [Feldmann

generalization of the well known hypergraph dualization problem. We give a
characterization of the complexity of the problem under various combined
restrictions on graph classes and posets, including bipartite, split and
co-bipartite graphs, and variants of neighborhood inclusion posets. In
particular, we show that while the enumeration of minimal dominating sets is
possible with linear delay in split graphs, the problem gets as hard as for
general graphs in distributive lattices. More surprisingly, this result holds
even when the poset coding the lattice is only comparing vertices of included
neighborhoods in the graph. If both the poset and the graph are sufficiently
restricted, we show that the dualization becomes tractable relying on existing
algorithms from the literature.

graphic matroid by adding a noise of small rank. More precisely, r-rank
perturbed graphic matroid M is a binary matroid that can be represented in the
form I +P, where I is the incidence matrix of some graph and P is a binary
matrix of rank at most r. Such matroids naturally appear in a number of
theoretical and applied settings. The main motivation behind our work is an
attempt to understand which parameterized algorithms for various problems on
graphs could be lifted to perturbed graphic matroids.
</p>
<p>We study the parameterized complexity of a natural generalization (for
matroids) of the following fundamental problems on graphs: Steiner Tree and
Multiway Cut. In this generalization, called the Space Cover problem, we are
given a binary matroid M with a ground set E, a set of terminals T\subseteq E,
and a non-negative integer k. The task is to decide whether T can be spanned by
a subset of E\setminus T of size at most k.
</p>
<p>We prove that on graphic matroid perturbations, for every fixed r, Space
Cover is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by k. On the other hand, the
problem becomes W[1]-hard when parameterized by r+k+|T| and it is NP-complete
for r\leq 2 and |T|\leq 2.
</p>
<p>On cographic matroids, that are the duals of graphic matroids, Space Cover
generalizes another fundamental and well-studied problem, namely Multiway Cut.
We show that on the duals of perturbed graphic matroids the Space Cover problem
is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by r+k.

presence of a small $k \times k$ submatrix with entries sampled from a
distribution $\mathcal{P}$ in an $n \times n$ matrix of samples from
$\mathcal{Q}$. This formulation includes a number of well-studied problems,
such as biclustering when $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ are Gaussians and the
planted dense subgraph formulation of community detection when the submatrix is
a principal minor and $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ are Bernoulli random
variables. These problems all seem to exhibit a universal phenomenon: there is
a statistical-computational gap depending on $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$
between the minimum $k$ at which this task can be solved and the minimum $k$ at
which it can be solved in polynomial time.
</p>
<p>Our main result is to tightly characterize this computational barrier as a
tradeoff between $k$ and the KL divergences between $\mathcal{P}$ and
$\mathcal{Q}$ through average-case reductions from the planted clique
conjecture. These computational lower bounds hold given mild assumptions on
$\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ arising naturally from classical binary
hypothesis testing. Our results recover and generalize the planted clique lower
bounds for Gaussian biclustering in Ma-Wu (2015) and Brennan et al. (2018) and
for the sparse and general regimes of planted dense subgraph in Hajek et al.
(2015) and Brennan et al. (2018). This yields the first universality principle
for computational lower bounds obtained through average-case reductions.

of the celebrated Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem. For LCIS, as well
as for LCS, there is an $O(n^2)$ algorithm and a SETH-based quadratic lower
bound. For LCS, there is also the Masek-Paterson $O(n^2 / \log{n})$ algorithm,
which does not seem to adapt to LCIS in any obvious way. Hence, a natural
question arises: does any sub-quadratic algorithm exist for the Longest Common
Increasing Subsequence problem? We answer this question positively, presenting
a $O(n^2 / \log^a{n})$ algorithm for some $a&gt;0$. The algorithm is not based on
memorizing small chunks of data (often used for logarithmic speedups, including
the "Four Russians Trick" in LCS), but rather utilizes a new technique,
bounding the number of significant symbol matches between the two sequences.

<p>In the Multiple-Weight Decision Problem, the input is an $n$-bit Boolean
function $f()$ given as a black-box and the objective is to determine the
number of $x$ for which $f(x)=1$, denoted as $wt(f)$, given some possible
values $\{w_1, \ldots, w_k\}$ for $wt(f)$. When our technique is applied to
this problem, we obtain the correct answer, maybe with a negligible error,
using $O(\log_2 k \sqrt{2^n})$ calls to $f()$ that shows a quadratic speedup
over classical approaches and currently known quantum algorithms.

conjectured that the value of the optimal solution to the subtour LP on these

Van Dal, and Sierksma. We prove this conjecture by giving an explicit optimal
solution to the subtour LP. We then use it to show that the integrality gap of
the subtour LP is 2 on circulant instances, making such instances one of the
few non-trivial classes of TSP instances for which the integrality gap of the
subtour LP is exactly known. We also show that the degree constraints do not
strengthen the subtour LP on circulant instances, mimicking the parsimonious
property of metric, symmetric TSP instances shown in Goemans and Bertsimas in a
distinctly non-metric set of instances.

The Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) asks whether a (given) Boolean function has a circuit of at most a (given) size. Despite over a half-century of study, we know relatively little about the computational complexity of MCSP. We do know that questions about the complexity of MCSP have significant ramifications on longstanding open problems. In a recent development, Golovnev et al. [11] improves the status of unconditional lower bounds for MCSP, showing that MCSP is not in $AC^0[p]$ for any prime $p$. While their results generalize to most "typical" circuit classes, it fails to generalize to the circuit minimization problem for depth-d formulas, denoted ($AC^0_d$)-MCSP. In particular, their result relies on a Lipchitz hypothesis that is unknown (and possibly false) in the case of ($AC^0_d$)-MCSP. Despite this, we show that ($AC^0_d$)-MCSP is not in $AC^0[p]$ by proving even the failure of the Lipchitzness for $AC^0_d$ formulas implies that MAJORITY reduces to ($AC^0_d$)-MCSP under $AC^0$ truth table reductions. Somewhat remarkably, our proof (in the case of non-Lipchitzness) uses completely different techniques than [11]. To our knowledge, this is the first MCSP reduction that uses modular properties of a function's circuit complexity.

We also define MOCSP, an oracle version of MCSP that takes as input a Boolean function $f$, a size threshold $s$, and oracle Boolean functions $f_1, ..., f_t$, and determines whether there is an oracle circuit of size at most $s$ that computes $f$ when given access to $f_1, ... , f_t$. We prove that MOCSP is $NP$-complete under non-uniform $AC^0$ many-one reductions as well as (uniform) $ZPP$ truth table reductions. We also observe that improving this $ZPP$ reduction to a deterministic polynomial-time reduction requires showing $EXP \neq ZPP$ (using theorems of Hitchcock and Pavan [17] and Murray and Williams [22]). Optimistically, these MOCSP results could be a first step towards $NP$-hardness results for MCSP. At the very least, we believe MOCSP clarifies the barriers towards proving hardness for MCSP and provides a useful "testing ground" for questions about MCSP.</div>

We show that any nondeterministic read-once branching program that computes a satisfiable Tseitin formula based on an $n\times n$ grid graph has size at least $2^{\Omega(n)}$. Then using the Excluded Grid Theorem by Robertson and Seymour we show that for arbitrary graph $G(V,E)$ any nondeterministic read-once branching program that computes a satisfiable Tseitin formula based on $G$ has size at least $2^{\Omega(tw(G)^\delta)}$ for all $\delta &lt;1/36$, where $tw(G)$ is the treewidth of $G$ (for planar graphs and some other classes of graphs the statement holds for $\delta=1$). We also show an upper bound $O(|E| 2^{pw(G)})$, where $pw(G)$ is the pathwidth of $G$.

We apply the mentioned results in the analysis of the complexity of derivation in the proof system $OBDD(\land, reordering)$ and show that any $OBDD(\land, reordering)$-refutation of an unsatisfiable Tseitin formula based on a graph $G$ has size at least $2^{\Omega(tw(G)^\delta)}$.</div>

All of twitter is .... atwitter?... over the <a href="https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/">OpenAI announcement</a> and partial non-release of code/documentation for a language model that purports to generate realistic-sounding text from simple prompts. The system actually addresses many NLP tasks, but the one that's drawing the most attention is the deepfakes-like generation of plausible news copy (<a href="https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/#sample3">here's one sample</a>).<br /><br />Most consternation is over the rapid PR buzz around the announcement, including somewhat breathless headlines (that OpenAI is not responsible for) like<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/17/openai-text-generator-dangerous/">OpenAI built a text generator so good, it’s considered too dangerous to release</a></blockquote>or<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/02/researchers-scared-by-their-own-work-hold-back-deepfakes-for-text-ai/">Researchers, scared by their own work, hold back “deepfakes for text” AI</a></blockquote>There are concerns that OpenAI is overhyping solid but incremental work, that they're disingenuously allowing for overhyped coverage in the way they released the information, or worse that they're deliberately controlling hype as a publicity stunt.<br /><br />I have nothing useful to add to the discussion above: indeed, see posts by <a href="https://anima-ai.org/2019/02/18/an-open-and-shut-case-on-openai/">Anima Anandkumar,</a> <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/should-i-open-source-my-model-1c109188b164">Rob Munro</a>, <a href="http://approximatelycorrect.com/2019/02/17/openai-trains-language-model-mass-hysteria-ensues/">Zachary Lipton</a>  and <a href="https://medium.com/@lowe.ryan.t/openais-gpt-2-the-model-the-hype-and-the-controversy-1109f4bfd5e8?sk=bc319cebc22fe0459574544828c84c6d">Ryan Lowe</a> for a comprehensive discussion of the issues relating to OpenAI.  Jack Clark from OpenAI has been engaging in a lot of twitter discussion on this as well.<br /><br />But what I do want to talk about is the larger issues around responsible science that this kerfuffle brings up. Caveat, as Margaret Mitchell puts it in this searing thread.<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><div lang="en" dir="ltr">It's really hard to watch the GPT-2 conversations unfold like so much else in tech. 1/</div>— MMitchell (@mmitchell_ai) <a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1097626427048964098?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2019</a></blockquote><br />To understand the kind of "norm-building" that needs to happen here, let's look at two related domains.<br /><br />In computer security, there's a fairly well-established model for finding weaknesses in systems. An exploit is discovered, the vulnerable entity is given a chance to fix it, and then the exploit is revealed , often simultaneously with patches that rectify it. Sometimes the vulnerability isn't easily fixed (see <a href="https://meltdownattack.com/">Meltdown and Spectre</a>). But it's still announced.<br /><br />A defining characteristic of security exploits is that they are targeted, specific and usually suggest a direct patch. The harms might be theoretical, but are still considered with as much seriousness as the exploit warrants.<br /><br />Let's switch to a different domain: biology. Starting from the sequencing of the human genome through the <a href="https://allofus.nih.gov/">million-person precision medicine project </a>to CRISPR and cloning babies, genetic manipulation has provided both invaluable technology for curing disease as well as grave ethical concerns about misuse of the technology. And professional organizations as well as the NIH have (sometimes slowly) risen to the challenge of articulating norms around the use and misuse of such technology.<br /><br />Here, the harms are often more diffuse, and the harms are harder to separate from the benefits. But the harm articulation is often focused on the individual patient, especially given the shadow of abuse that darkens the history of medicine.<br /><br />The harms with various forms of AI/ML technology are myriad and diffuse. They can cause structural damage to society - in the concerns over bias, the ways in which automation affects labor, the way in which fake news can erode trust and a common frame of truth, and so many others - and they can cause direct harm to individuals. And the scale at which these harms can happen is immense.<br /><br />So where are the professional groups, the experts in thinking about the risks of democratization of ML, and all the folks concerned about the harms associated with AI tech? Why don't we have the equivalent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asilomar_Conference_on_Recombinant_DNA">Asilomar conference on recombinant DNA</a>?<br /><br />I appreciate that OpenAI has at least raised the issue of thinking through the ethical ramifications of releasing technology. But as the furore over their decision has shown, no single imperfect actor can really claim to be setting the guidelines for ethical technology release, and "starting the conversation" doesn't count when (again as Margaret Mitchell points out) these kinds of discussions have been going on in different settings for many years already.<br /><br />Ryan Lowe suggests workshops at major machine learning conferences. That's not a bad idea. But it will attract the people who go to machine learning conferences. It won't bring in the journalists, the people getting SWAT'd (and one case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Wichita_swatting">killed</a>) by fake news, the women being harassed by trolls online with deep-fake porn images. <br /><br />News is driven by news cycles. Maybe OpenAI's announcement will lead to us thinking more about issues of responsible data science. But let's not pretend these are new, or haven't been studied for a long time, or need to have a discussion "started".<br /><br /><br /><div class="feedflare">

We show that any $n$-variate polynomial computable by a syntactically multilinear circuit of size $\mathop{poly}(n)$ can be computed by a depth-$4$ syntactically multilinear ($\Sigma\Pi\Sigma\Pi$) circuit of size at most $\exp\left({O\left(\sqrt{n\log n}\right)}\right)$. For degree $d = \omega(n/\log n)$, this improves upon the upper bound of $\exp\left({O(\sqrt{d}\log n)}\right)$ obtained by Tavenas (MFCS 2015) for general circuits, and is known to be asymptotically optimal in the exponent when $d &lt; n^{\epsilon}$ for a small enough constant $\epsilon$. Our upper bound matches the lower bound of $\exp\left({\Omega\left(\sqrt{n\log n}\right)}\right)$ proved by Raz and Yehudayoff (CC 2009), and thus cannot be improved further in the exponent. Our results hold over all fields and also generalize to circuits of small individual degree.  

More generally, we show that an $n$-variate polynomial computable by a syntactically multilinear circuit of size $\mathop{poly}(n)$ can be computed by a syntactically multilinear circuit of product-depth $\Delta$ of size at most $\exp\left(O\left(\Delta \cdot (n/\log n)^{1/\Delta} \cdot \log n\right)\right)$. It follows from the lower bounds of Raz and Yehudayoff (CC 2009) that in general, for constant $\Delta$, the exponent in this upper bound is tight and cannot be improved to $o\left(\left(n/\log n\right)^{1/\Delta}\cdot \log n\right)$.</div>

I recently read an absurd article that speculated on who the Democratic VICE prez nominees will be. Yes, you read that right, VICE Prez. Gee, wouldn't knowing who the Prez nominees was first help. But leave it to Nate Silver and company to have a fascinating yet... premature article on this. Here is the link: <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-very-first-2020-vice-presidential-draft/">article on who will be Dem VP nominee</a>.  Its hard enough to pick the VP when the Prez is known! I did a blog on how badly intrade would do on predicting VP, <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2008/09/i-would-be-on-intrade-that-intrade-will.html">here</a>.

<i>If the Prez is a female then the VP will likely be a male because it is thought, righly or wrongly, that all-female ticket can't win</i><br />
<br />
is not partisan or sexist, it is stating an opinion about how voters would go. It may be incorrect, but its not offensive.<br />
<br />
Here is what the class thought the article was saying (and I think they are right) expressed in Logic.<br />
<br />
Note one other thing-- the Prez nominees  might not be the choice of the party (Trump wasn't the choice of the Rep party in 2016, though not clear who was, see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2015/05/the-law-of-excluded-middle-of-road.html">here</a>) but the VP really will be since (I think) the party has more control over that.<br />
<br />
If the Prez Nominees is female then the Vice Prez nominee will be male. (I agree)<br />
<br />
If the Prez Nominees is white mail then the Vice Prez nominee will be either female or non-white but not both. (Great question to express that as symbols. Not sure what I think- the thought is that two white males will be odd since so many of the candidates are female or non-white. Having said that, in recent years the VP has NOT been someone else who ran:  Clinton-Keane, Keane had not been a candidate, Trump-Pence, Pence had not been a candidate, Romney-Ryan, Ryan had not been a candidate, Obama-Biden, Biden had been a candidate briefly in 2008, but this was not one of these `lets unite the party by picking by OPPONENT to be VP', McCain-Palin, Palin had not been a candidate. Kerry-Edwards. YES- Edwards had been a serious candidate in 2004, though some think he was running for VP all along since he never said an unkind word about his opponents)<br />
<br />
Prez from one of the coasts IFF VP from the center. (I won't go over the list again, but this has been less of a thing since Clinton-Gore were both from flyover states.)<br />
<br />
Ideology- If Prez is establishment then VP is leftists. (Not sure these terms are so well defined to say this, and their are other ideologies as well, not sure how they fit in.)<br />
<br />
If Prez lacks Fed Experience then VP should have Fed Exp. (Quite common: Obama-Biden, Romney-Ryan, Clinton-Gore, Bush-Cheney)<br />
<br />If Prez has fed experience than nothing can be deduced about VP Fed Exp.<br />
<br />
If Prez lacks gravitas then VP should have gravitas (tricky! Don't want the VP to outshine the Prez!)<br />
<br />
Absolute statement: VP should not outshine prez. A Kangaroo ticket is when the people prefer the VP to the Prez (Dukakis-Bentsen had this problem. Kerry-Edwards might have).<br />
<br />
If Prez is boring then VP should be exciting. But again tricky! (I think that was why McCain picked Palin. And she was exciting, but not really in a good way. Couldn't he have picked someone exciting, and perhaps female who was, you know, Qualified?)<br />
<br />
VP's like doctors: do no harm.<br />
<br />
VP from Swing state helpful but not necc.<br />
<br />
Bad to have a VP who is a senator from a state where the Governor is republican and picks the replacement senator.<br />
<br />
VP should be someone who the country can picture being president without laughing. I am not talking ideology I am talking about seriousness and experience. Palin was the only one in recent memory who even voters of her party worried that she was not up to being president. One pundit defending the choice talked about how McCain was healthy and hence Palin wouldn't become prez so don't worry about it. NOT reassuring! Quayle was also not seen as serious, though not as much as Palin.<br />
<br />
If Prez is old then VP mattes more(?)<br />
<br />
Many of the above depend on who the Prez is. And that is one of the points: one can write down a long prop formula with many IF-THEN's to determine who properties the VP will have, and then<br />
<br />
1) When the Prez is picked many of the variables are set and hence the formula becomes much easeier and<br />
<br />
2) Could STILL be wrong!<br />
<br />
MY prediction: my last two predictions have been wrong so I am reluctant go predict anything. But I will tell you my WRONG predictions and then my current one<br />
<br />
I predicted Paul Ryan would be the Prez Nominee in 2016. He didn't even run.<br />
<br />
I predicted that Al Franken would be the Prez Nominess in 2020- he understands TV and was an entertainer, so he could match Trump. Whoops.<br />
<br />
So with that sterling record I predict: Prez: Cory Booker, VP: Beto<br />
<br />
I am NOT a pundit- so what I predict is not what I hope happens.  What do I hope? In the interest of full disclosure (gee, shouldn't that have come at the beginning) I admit that I want to see Trump lose but I have no idea what makes someone `electable' nowadays.<br />

Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) asks to decide if a given truth table of an $n$-variate boolean function has circuit complexity less than a given parameter $s$. We prove that MCSP is hard for constant-depth circuits with mod $p$ gates, for any prime $p\geq 2$ (the circuit class $AC^0[p])$. Namely, we show that MCSP requires $d$-depth $AC^0[p]$ circuits of size at least $exp(N^{0.49/d})$, where $N=2^n$ is the size of an input truth table of an $n$-variate boolean function.  Our circuit lower bound proof shows that MCSP can solve the coin problem: distinguish uniformly random $N$-bit strings from those generated using independent samples from a biased random coin which is $1$ with probability $1/2+N^{-0.49}$, and $0$ otherwise. Solving the coin problem with such parameters is known to require exponentially large $AC^0[p]$ circuits. Moreover, this also implies that MAJORITY is computable by a non-uniform $AC^0$ circuit of polynomial size that also has MCSP-oracle gates. The latter has a few other consequences for the complexity of MCSP, e.g., we get that any boolean function in $NC^1$ (i.e., computable by a polynomial-size formula) can also be computed by a non-uniform polynomial-size $AC^0$ circuit with MCSP-oracle gates.</div>

Tetsuya Miyamoto is a mathematics teacher who divides his time between Tokyo and Manhattan. He is known for creating in 2004 the popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KenKen">KenKen</a> puzzle, which the New York Times started running ten years ago. As with its sister puzzles Sudoku and Kakuro, unlimited-size versions of it are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" />-complete.</p>
<p>
Today we observe the 10th anniversary of this blog and ask what progress has been made on the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%3DNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P=NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P=NP}}" /> question.</p>
<p>
The <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%3DNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P=NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P=NP}}" /> is a question about <em>asymptotic</em> complexity. From time to time we have tried to raise corresponding questions about <em>concrete</em> complexity that might yield more progress. What catches our eye about the KenKen puzzles is that their generation is a full-blown application within concrete complexity. The NYT’s KenKen puzzles are all generated using software by David Levy that can tailor their hardness. Quoting the NYT anniversary <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/reader-center/kenken-puzzle-10th-anniversary.html">article</a> by Will Shortz:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em>[Levy’s] program knows every possible method for solving a KenKen, which he has rated in difficulty from easy to hard. Thus, when a KenKen has been made, the computer knows exactly how hard it is. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
This seems to say there is a hardness measure that is objective—quite apart from the idea of having human testers try the puzzle and say how hard they found it to be. We surmise that it is lower for instances that have more forced plays at the start. We wonder whether Levy’s criteria can be generalized.</p>
<p>
Incidentally, this is the same Levy who won a challenge chess match in 1978 against the computer Chess 4.7 to complete his win of a famous ten-year $1,000+ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Levy_(chess_player)#Computer_chess_bet">bet</a>. He lost $1,000 back when he was defeated by Deep Thought in 1989. He later became president of the International Computer Games Association (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Computer_Games_Association">ICGA</a>), whose <a href="https://icga.org/?page_id=26"><em>Journal</em></a> published a nice <a href="https://www.cs.wmich.edu/elise/courses/cs431/icga2008.pdf">paper</a> on the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" />-completess of the aforementioned puzzles and many others.</p>

<p></p><p>
GLL’s first <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/02/12/bait-and-switch-why-lower-bounds-are-so-hard/">post</a>, on 12 Feb. 2009, featured Stephen Rudich and his work on the “<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/natural.pdf">Natural</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_proof">Proofs</a>.” <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/02/12/is-np-too-big-or-p-too-small/">Two</a> other <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/02/12/a-nightmare-about-sat/">posts</a> that day covered other aspects of why the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%3DNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P=NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P=NP}}" /> question is hard. Our question, dear readers, is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Has anything happened in the past ten years to make any part of those posts out-of-date in the slightest way? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
We won’t claim any such progress, though we have tried to stir ideas. In the meantime, we have written 806 other posts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Some have featured our own work and ideas (considering Ken’s chess research in a separate vein); <p></p>
</li><li>
some have featured others’ direct attempts at breakthrough lower and upper bounds (with a few successes); <p></p>
</li><li>
many have featured other kinds of results by others; <p></p>
</li><li>
many have pulled “idea nuggets” from the past; <p></p>
</li><li>
many have been humor and social commentary.
</li></ul>
<p>
To date, we’ve had 18,575 comments plus trackbacks on these posts and just over 2.1 million views. We are less able to quantify impacts, beyond occasionally seeing citations of articles on the blog as sources. We try for precision as well as readability and are grateful for reader comments with fixes when we slip up on the former.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> P vs NP </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
There continue to be claims of proofs that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%5Cneq+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}" /> and some that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%3DNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P=NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P=NP}}" /> While these proofs do not seem to be correct, there is something that we wish to remark about them. Many argue as follows: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> There is some problem say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" /> that seems to require a search of exponentially many objects. Then the proof states that any algorithm for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" /> must actually look at all or most of the exponentially many objects. This of course is where the proof is not complete. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
There is some sense to these proofs. They seem related to the oracle proofs that for example show that for some oracle set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> it is the case that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%5E%7BA%7D+%5Cneq+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%5E%7BA%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \mathsf{P}^{A} \neq \mathsf{NP}^{A}. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \mathsf{P}^{A} \neq \mathsf{NP}^{A}. " /></p>
<p>we have discussed these types of proofs before—we even said that we did not like them.</p>
<p>
The trouble with these results that are rigorous is that they change <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P}}" /> vs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" /> in a central manner, and this seems to make the results much less interesting. Roughly here is how they argue: Imagine that for each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> we either put a string of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> or we do not. The point is that if we do this in a <i>unpredictable</i> manner then a polynomial time machine will not be able to decide whether for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> there is or is not a string of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />. But a nondeterministic machine with just use its power and guess. This shows, essentially, that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%5E%7BA%7D+%5Cneq+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%5E%7BA%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \mathsf{P}^{A} \neq \mathsf{NP}^{A} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \mathsf{P}^{A} \neq \mathsf{NP}^{A} " /></p>
<p>is true.</p>
<p>
There is some relationship to many attempts to show <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D+%5Cneq+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}" />. The proofs often argue that one must look at all the objects. The counterpart here is that a polynomial time machine will not have enough time to check the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^{n}}" class="latex" title="{2^{n}}" /> strings of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> to see if they are in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />. But this works in the oracle case because we allow the rule that decides whether or not a string is in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> to be very complicated. In the real world, in the world where we study the real <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D+%5Cneq+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}" /> question, we cannot assume that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BNP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{NP}" class="latex" title="{NP}" />-complete problems use a complicated rule. <i>That is precisely what we are trying to prove</i>.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> State of the Game </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What can we say? Mostly the big open questions remain. We still have no non-linear lower bounds on circuit complexity and no progress of any definite kind on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%3D%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}}" />. What do you think?</p>
<p>
What is commonly hailed as one of the two biggest results in our field last year was a positive solution to what is intuitively a slightly weaker form of the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). For UGC we can refer you to Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_games_conjecture">article</a>:</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/uniquegameswikipedia.png"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/uniquegameswikipedia.png?w=400&amp;h=106" alt="" width="400" class="aligncenter wp-image-15648" height="106" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
The note [2] is in turn a reference to a 2010 <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/05/05/unique-games-a-three-act-play/">post</a> here. The new <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2018/006/">paper</a> proves hardness for the relaxed situation where, roughly speaking, a trial assignment to a node in a constraint graph limits the other node on any connecting edge to at most two possible values, rather than a unique value as in UGC. This relaxation retains many properties that had caused disbelief in the original UGC, yet it was proved—in that sense a big deal. </p>
<p>
Nevertheless we note that UGC, at its core, is just asserting that for arbitrarily small <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon}" />, with our power to make other parameter(s) as large as desired, we can execute an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" />-hardness proof. We have been executing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" />-hardness proofs for almost fifty years. That is something we in the field have proven good at. True, these hardness results becomes lower bound proofs if and when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP+%5Cneq+P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP \neq P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP \neq P}}" /> is proved, and true, we have been as vocal as any on the standpoint that significant lower bounds will come from constructions that are usually thought of as being for upper bounds. But the new proof from a year ago doesn’t feel like that. We invite readers to tell us connections from UGC to the possibility of actually constructing lower bounds.</p>

Last Monday, 11 February, was the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/women-and-girls-in-science-day/" target="_blank">International Day of Women in Science</a>. I planned to post the answers I received from three junior female computer scientists to three questions I asked them. However, being a computer scientist who is short of time like everyone else, I asked for a one-week deadline extension to do so.<br /><br />The questions were <br /><ol><li>When did you become interested in science?</li><li>Why did you choose computer science?</li><li>Which advice would you give to a high-school student who is thinking about pursuing a career in science?  </li></ol>Here are the (unedited) answers in the order in which I received them, in case they might be of interest to (female) students of all ages. I have anonymized the answers as the message is more important than the messengers. <br /><br />Colleague #1<br /><br /><ol><li>I never had a sentence like "I am interested in science" in my mind, it  was just that I always in one way or another enjoyed learning about  things, school and education, and I wanted to continue being in that  type of surroundings after graduating from university. </li><li>I actually studied mathematics, I was not interested in computer  science. I had some algorithms and programming classes during my  studies, which I found cute but not much more than that. I started being  seriously interested in computer science only when I took a class on  mathematical theory of computation. This class combined the  mathematical/theoretical/<div>philosophical approach I liked so much with (for me) a new and refreshing set of questions. </div></li><li> Try it and see how it goes. </li></ol>Colleague #2<br /><br /><ol><li>My interest in science started when visiting the SMAU that is an     event where companies, investors and startups aim to promote the     Made in Italy Research and Innovation. It was simply amazing to     learn about startups, laboratories, research centres, universities     and small companies showing so many novel ideas and technologies in     one day, it really impressed me a lot. </li><li>Computer science was the alternative to Math (my preferred subject     at the scientific high school) but I thought it was too abstract and     full of theories, demonstrations and proofs, maybe too much.     Computer science has the theoretical part that is fascinating but it     also has some more practical implications, it is somehow more     concrete, and I like both sides. </li><li>Don't be afraid to fail, be afraid not to try. I think it is     worthwhile to try if you have any inclination to science because you     are exposed to problem solving reasoning, and these efforts can be     helpful for building a better society.<span class="im"></span> </li></ol>Colleague #3<br /><br /><ol><li style="margin-left: 15px;">From the junior secondary school, scientific subjects were my favorites, together with history.</li><li style="margin-left: 15px;">During the high school, I started to study computer science and also  laboratory of computer science where it was applied to other subjects  such as Math and Business Economics. I was really passionate of this  subject, which was among my favorite. When it was time to choose for the  University, computer science was naturally the first in the list. I  also had other alternatives but in the end I quickly decided to apply  for computer science.</li><li style="margin-left: 15px;">My advice is simply to do whatever he/she really likes and for which  he/she is good and has obtained good results, without thinking too much  about work opportunities or what other people (e.g., parents) want for  them. For each career, in science or not, passion is the main ingredient  to reach good results. Then, I also think that one can change his/her  mind and do something completely different after the university. The  important is to study what one really likes.</li></ol><br /><br /></div>

<p>In this post  I would like to tell you about three papers and three theorems. I am thankful to Moshe White and Imre Barany for helpful discussions.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07197">a) Universality of vector sequences and universality of Tverberg partitions,</a> by Attila Por;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Theorem (Por’s universality result, 2018):</strong> Every long enough sequence of points in general position in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb R^d" class="latex" title="\mathbb R^d" />  contains a subsequence of length <em><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-16-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-98"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-99"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-100">n</span></span></span></span></em> whose Tverberg partitions are exactly the so called rainbow partitions.</p>
<p class="title mathjax"><strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01078">b) Classifying unavoidable Tverberg partitions</a>, by <a href="http://www.borisbukh.org/">Boris Bukh</a>, <a href="http://www.math.cmu.edu/~ploh/">Po-Shen Loh</a>, <a href="http://www.gabrielnivasch.org/">Gabriel Nivasch</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Theorem (Bukh, Loh, and Nivasch, 2017):</strong> Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> be a tree-like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="r" class="latex" title="r" />-uniform simple hypergraph with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d+1" class="latex" title="d+1" /> edges and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D%28d%2B1%29%28r-1%29%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n=(d+1)(r-1)+1" class="latex" title="n=(d+1)(r-1)+1" /> edges. It is possible to associate to the vertices of each such hypergraph H a set X of n points in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb R^d" class="latex" title="\mathbb R^d" /> so that the Tverberg partitions of X correspond precisely to rainbow coloring of the hypergraph H. Moreover, the number of rainbow coloring is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29%21%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(r-1)!^d" class="latex" title="(r-1)!^d" />. (Here, we consider two colorings as the same if they differ by a permutation of the colors.)</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07262">c) On Tverberg partitions</a>, by Moshe White</strong></p>
<p><strong>Theorem (White, 2015):</strong> For any partition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2Ca_2%2C%5Cdots+%2Ca_r%3A+1+%5Cle+a_i%5Cle+d%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="a_1,a_2,\dots ,a_r: 1 \le a_i\le d+1" class="latex" title="a_1,a_2,\dots ,a_r: 1 \le a_i\le d+1" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" />, there exists a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Csubset+%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="X \subset \mathbb R^d" class="latex" title="X \subset \mathbb R^d" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" />  points, such that every Tverberg partition of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="X" class="latex" title="X" />  induces the same partition on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> given by the parts <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C%5Cdots%2Ca_r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="a_1,\dots,a_r" class="latex" title="a_1,\dots,a_r" />.

<h2>Radon’s and Tverberg’s theorems and Sierksma’s conjecture</h2>
<p>Recall the beautiful theorem of Tverberg: (We devoted two posts (<a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/11/24/sarkarias-proof-of-tverbergs-theorem-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Tverberg 1">I</a>, <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/11/26/sarkarias-proof-of-tverbergs-theorem-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Tverberg 2">II</a>) to its background and proof.)</p>
<p><strong>Tverberg Theorem (1965): </strong>Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2Cx_2%2C%5Cdots%2C+x_m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x_1,x_2,\dots, x_m" class="latex" title="x_1,x_2,\dots, x_m" /> be points in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^d" class="latex" title="R^d" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m+%5Cge+%28r-1%29%28d%2B1%29%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="m \ge (r-1)(d+1)+1" class="latex" title="m \ge (r-1)(d+1)+1" />. Then there is a partition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_1%2CS_2%2C%5Cdots%2C+S_r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S_1,S_2,\dots, S_r" class="latex" title="S_1,S_2,\dots, S_r" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B1%2C2%2C%5Cdots%2Cm%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\{1,2,\dots,m\}" class="latex" title="\{1,2,\dots,m\}" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccap+_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5Erconv+%28x_i%3A+i+%5Cin+S_j%29+%5Cne+%5Cemptyset&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\cap _{j=1}^rconv (x_i: i \in S_j) \ne \emptyset" class="latex" title="\cap _{j=1}^rconv (x_i: i \in S_j) \ne \emptyset" />.</p>
<p>The (much easier) case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3D2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="r=2" class="latex" title="r=2" /> of Tverberg’s theorem is <strong>Radon’s theorem</strong>.</p>
<p>We devoted a post to <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/12/23/seven-problems-around-tverbergs-theorem/">seven open problems related to Tverberg’s theorem</a>, and one of them was:</p>
<p><strong>Sierksma Conjecture:</strong> The number of Tverberg’s <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="r" class="latex" title="r" />-partitions of a set of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29%28d%2B1%29%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(r-1)(d+1)+1" class="latex" title="(r-1)(d+1)+1" /> points in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^d" class="latex" title="R^d" /> is at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%28r-1%29%21%29%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="((r-1)!)^d" class="latex" title="((r-1)!)^d" />.</p>
<p>Gerard Sierksma’s construction with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29%21%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(r-1)!^d" class="latex" title="(r-1)!^d" /> Tverberg’s partition is obtained by taking <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(r-1)" class="latex" title="(r-1)" /> copies of each vertex of a simplex containing the origin in its interior, and adding the origin itself. A configuration of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29%28d%2B1%29%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(r-1)(d+1)+1" class="latex" title="(r-1)(d+1)+1" /> points in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^d" class="latex" title="R^d" /> with precisely <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%28r-1%29%21%29%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="((r-1)!)^d" class="latex" title="((r-1)!)^d" /> Tverberg partitions to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="r" class="latex" title="r" /> parts is called a <strong>Sierksma Configuration</strong>.</p>
<h2>White’s Theorem</h2>
<p>In 2015 Moshe White proved the following theorem which was an open problem for many years. White’s construction was surprisingly simple.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 1 (White, 2015):</strong>  For any partition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2Ca_2%2C%5Cdots+%2Ca_r%3A+1+%5Cle+a_i%5Cle+d%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="a_1,a_2,\dots ,a_r: 1 \le a_i\le d+1" class="latex" title="a_1,a_2,\dots ,a_r: 1 \le a_i\le d+1" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" />, there exists a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Csubset+%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="X \subset \mathbb R^d" class="latex" title="X \subset \mathbb R^d" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" />  points, such that every Tverberg partition of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="X" class="latex" title="X" />  induces the same partition on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> given by the parts <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C%5Cdots%2Ca_r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="a_1,\dots,a_r" class="latex" title="a_1,\dots,a_r" />. Moreover, the number of Tverberg’s partitions of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="X" class="latex" title="X" /> is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29%21%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(r-1)!^d" class="latex" title="(r-1)!^d" /></p>
<h2>Bukh, Loh, and Nivasch’s  examples via staircase convexity.</h2>
<h2><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/cascade-tverberg.png"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/cascade-tverberg.png?w=640&amp;h=463" alt="" width="640" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16844" height="463" /></a></h2>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Five tree-like simple hypergraphs that correspond to configurations of 11 points in 4-dimensional space.</span></strong></p>
<p>Start with a tree-like hypergraph H of d+1 blocks of size r like the five examples in the Figure above. The intersection of every two blocks has at most one element. The union of all blocks has n=(d+1)(r-1)+1 elements.</p>
<p>A <strong>rainbow coloring</strong> of a r-uniform hypergraph H is a coloring of the vertices of H with r colors so that the vertices of every edge is colored by all r colors.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 2 (Bukh, Loh, and Nivasch):</strong> It is possible to associate to the vertices of each such hypergraph H a set X of n points in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb R^d" class="latex" title="\mathbb R^d" /> so that the Tverberg partitions of X correspond precisely to rainbow coloring of the hypergraph H. Moreover, the number of rainbow coloring is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29%21%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(r-1)!^d" class="latex" title="(r-1)!^d" />. (Here, we consider two colorings as the same if they differ by a permutation of the colors.)</p>
<p>For a star-like hypergraph where all blocks have a vertex in common we get the original Sierksma’s example. (Example (d) above.) White’s examples are obtained by considering such hypergraphs where there exists an edge <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A" class="latex" title="A" /> such that all edges have non empty intersection with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A" class="latex" title="A" />. (Examples (c), (d), and (e) above).</p>

<h2>Tverberg’s partitions for stretched points on the moment curve</h2>
<p>It is natural to consider $n$ points on the moment curve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29%3D%28t%2Ct%5E2%2C%5Cdots%2C+t%5Ed%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x(t)=(t,t^2,\dots, t^d)" class="latex" title="x(t)=(t,t^2,\dots, t^d)" />. It turns out that the set of Tverberg’s partitions for points on the moment curve depend on the precise location of the points. By stretched points on the moment curve I mean that  you take the points <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t_1%29%2C+x%28t_2%29%2C+%5Cdots+x%28t_n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x(t_1), x(t_2), \dots x(t_n)" class="latex" title="x(t_1), x(t_2), \dots x(t_n)" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t_1+%3C%3C+t_2+%3C%3C+%5Cdots+t_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="t_1 &lt;&lt; t_2 &lt;&lt; \dots t_n" class="latex" title="t_1 &lt;&lt; t_2 &lt;&lt; \dots t_n" />, namely $t_2$ is much much larger than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="t_1" class="latex" title="t_1" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t_3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="t_3" class="latex" title="t_3" /> is much much much much larger than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="t_2" class="latex" title="t_2" />, etc. etc. In this case, the configuration corresponds to a <strong>path</strong> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" />: you let the vertices be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B1%2C2%2C%5Cdots%2Cn%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\{1,2,\dots,n\}" class="latex" title="\{1,2,\dots,n\}" /> and the edges are sets of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B%28k-1%29%28r-1%29%2B1%2C+%28k-1%29%28r-1%29%2B2%2C%5Cdots+%2C+k%28r-1%29%2B1%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\{(k-1)(r-1)+1, (k-1)(r-1)+2,\dots , k(r-1)+1\}" class="latex" title="\{(k-1)(r-1)+1, (k-1)(r-1)+2,\dots , k(r-1)+1\}" />. A stretched configuration of points on the moment curve has the property that every subset is also a stretched configuration of points on the moment curve.</p>
<p>The importance of Tverberg’s partitions for stretched points on the moment curve was realized by Barany and Por, by Bukh, Loh, and Nivasch, and by Perles and Sidron (See their paper <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-016-9813-3">Tverberg Partitions of Points on the Moment Curve</a>), and perhaps by others as well.</p>
<h2>Por’s universality result</h2>
<p>Por’s universality theorem asserts that in terms of Tverberg partitions every large enough configuration of points in general position in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^d" class="latex" title="R^d" /> contains a configuration whose Tverberg partitions are those of a stretched configuration of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> points on the moment curve! Por’s  universality result was conjectured independently by Bukh, Loh, and Nivasch, (and they gave some partial results) and by Por himself.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 3 (Por’s universality result, 2018):</strong> Every long enough sequence of points in <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-15-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-91"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-92"><span class="msubsup" id="MathJax-Span-93"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-97"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb R^d" class="latex" title="\mathbb R^d" /></span></span></span></span></span> in general position contains a subsequence  of length <em><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-16-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-98"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-99"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-100">n</span></span></span></span></em> whose Tverberg partitions are exactly the so called rainbow partitions.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Por actually proved an apparently stronger statement: We can find a subsequence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="Y" class="latex" title="Y" /> so the conclusion holds not only for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="Y" class="latex" title="Y" /> but also for every subsequence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="Z" class="latex" title="Z" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="Y" class="latex" title="Y" />. </span></p>
<h2>Staircase Convexity</h2>
<p>The work of Bukh, Loh, and Nivasch relied on an important method of “staircase convexity”. An earlier 2001 application of the method (where it was introduced) was for lower bounds on weak epsilon nets by Bukh, Matousek, and Nivasch (Here are links to the paper, and to <a href="http://www.borisbukh.org/geomselthms_talk.pdf">slides from a talk by Boris Bukh</a>. See also <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2007/04/22/gil-kalai-the-weak-epsilon-net-problem/">this post</a> and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/04/05/nathan-rubin-improved-the-bound-for-planar-weak-%CE%B5-nets-and-other-news-from-ein-gedi/">this one</a> of the weak epsilon net problem.) Roughly the idea is this: consider a stretched grid where the sequence of coordinates are very very fast growing. When you choose configuration of points in such a grid, questions regarding their convex hulls translate to purely combinatorial problems.</p>

In their <a href="http://archive.numdam.org/ARCHIVE/CM/CM_1935__2_/CM_1935__2__463_0/CM_1935__2__463_0.pdf">seminal 1935 paper</a>, Erdős and Szekeres showed that <em>ES(n)</em> is finite.</p>
<p>The finiteness of ES(n) can be stated as follows: Given a sequence of N points in general position in the plane <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2Cx_2%2C+%5Cdots+%2C+x_N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x_1,x_2, \dots , x_N" class="latex" title="x_1,x_2, \dots , x_N" />  there is a subsequence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1_i%2Cx_2%2C+%5Cdots+%2C+x_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="1_i,x_2, \dots , x_n" class="latex" title="1_i,x_2, \dots , x_n" /> such that the line segments <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Bx_i%2Cx_k%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="[x_i,x_k]" class="latex" title="[x_i,x_k]" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Bx_j%2Cx_%5Cell+%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="[x_j,x_\ell ]" class="latex" title="[x_j,x_\ell ]" /> intersect. With this statement, the Erdős and Szekeres’ theorem can be seen as identifying a universal set of points in term of its <em>Radon partitions </em>(or equivalently in terms of its <em>order type</em>).</p>
<h3>In high dimensions</h3>
<p>In higher dimensions we can define <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ES_d%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="ES_d(n)" class="latex" title="ES_d(n)" /> and replace “in convex position” by “in cyclic position”. The finiteness of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ES_d%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="ES_d(n)" class="latex" title="ES_d(n)" /> (with terrible bounds) follows easily from various Ramsey results. In a series of papers very good lower and upper bounds where obtained:  <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&amp;query=Barany%2C+I">Imre Barany</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&amp;query=Matousek%2C+J">Jiri Matousek</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&amp;query=Por%2C+A">Attila Por</a>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1147">Curves in R^d intersecting every hyperplane at most d+1 times</a>;  <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&amp;query=Eli%C3%A1%C5%A1%2C+M">Marek Eliáš</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&amp;query=Matou%C5%A1ek%2C+J">Jiří Matoušek</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&amp;query=Rold%C3%A1n-Pensado%2C+E">Edgardo Roldán-Pensado</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&amp;query=Safernov%C3%A1%2C+Z">Zuzana Safernová</a>:<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5157"> Lower bounds on geometric Ramsey functions</a>; Marek Elias, Jiri Matousek: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3824">Higher-order Erdos–Szekeres theorems </a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3824">.</a></p>
<h3>Por’s result</h3>
<p>Por’s result can be seen as a far-reaching strengthening of the finiteness of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ES_d%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="ES_d(n)" class="latex" title="ES_d(n)" />.</p>
<h2>Further Discussion:</h2>
<h3>High order order types?</h3>
<p>Can you base a higher-order notion of “order types” on Tverberg partitions?</p>
<p>The <strong>order type</strong> of a sequence of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> points affinely spanning <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^d" class="latex" title="R^d" />, is the described by the vector of signs (0, 1 or -1) of volume of simplices described by subsequences of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d+1" class="latex" title="d+1" />. Equivalently the order type can be described by the minimal Radon partitions of the points.</p>
<ol>
<li>We can first ask if we can base a notion of higher order types on Tverberg’s partitions to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="r" class="latex" title="r" /> parts where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="r&gt;2" class="latex" title="r&gt;2" />.</li>
<li>Next we can ask for an associated notion of “higher order oriented matroids.” (Oriented matroids in the usual sense are abstract order types which coincide with Euclidean order types for every subsequence of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%2B3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d+3" class="latex" title="d+3" /> points.)</li>
<li>A natural question regarding these “higher order types is: If a sequence of points in strong general position is Tverberg-equivalent to stretched points on the moment curve, does it apply to all of its subsequences?</li>
</ol>
<p>Another way to consider “higher” order types is to enlarge the family by to start with a family of points add to it all Radon points of minimal Radon’s partition and consider the order type of the new configuration. (This operation can be repeated <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="r" class="latex" title="r" /> times.) See <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00147418">this paper of Michael Kallay on point sets which contain their Radon points</a>.</p>
<h3>Staircase convexity order types</h3>
<p>Understanding order types of configuration of points on stretched grids of Bukh et al. is a very interesting problem. It is interesting to understand such configurations that are not in general position as well. (In particular, which matroids are supported on the stretched grid?) Of course, the method may well have many more applications.</p>
<h3>Fantastically strong forms of Sierksma’s conjecture</h3>
<p>Is the following true: For every sequence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D%28r-1%29%28d%2B1%29%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n=(r-1)(d+1)+1" class="latex" title="n=(r-1)(d+1)+1" /> points in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^d" class="latex" title="R^d" /> there is a Sierksma’s configuration <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> of $n$ points so that every Tverberg’s partition of  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> is a Tverberg’s partition of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" />?</p>
<p>An even stronger version is:</p>
<p>Does every sequence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29%28d%2B1%29%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(r-1)(d+1)+1" class="latex" title="(r-1)(d+1)+1" /> points in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^d" class="latex" title="R^d" /> there is a tree-like simple hypergraph so that all the rainbow coloring of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> correspond to Tverberg partitions of the sequence? If true this will be a fantastically strong version of Sierksma’s conjecture.</p>
<h3>Is the Erdős-Szekeres’ conjecture outrageous?</h3>
<p>Erdős and Szekeres proved in 1935 that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ES%28n%29%5Cle+%7B%7B2n-4%7D%5Cchoose%7Bn-2%7D%7D%2B1%3D4%5E%7Bn-o%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="ES(n)\le {{2n-4}\choose{n-2}}+1=4^{n-o(n)}" class="latex" title="ES(n)\le {{2n-4}\choose{n-2}}+1=4^{n-o(n)}" />, and in 1960, they showed that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ES%28n%29+%5Cge+2%5E%7Bn-2%7D%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="ES(n) \ge 2^{n-2}+1" class="latex" title="ES(n) \ge 2^{n-2}+1" />, and conjectured this to be optimal. Despite the efforts of many researchers, until recently no improvement in the order of magnitude has ever been made on the upper bound over  81 years. A  recent breakthrough result by Andrew Suk (Here are links<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08657"> to the paper</a>, and to<a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2016/05/04/the-erdos-szekeres-polygon-problem-solved-asymptotically-by-andrew-suk/"> our post discussing the result</a>) asserts that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ES%28n%29%3D2%5E%7Bn%2Bo%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="ES(n)=2^{n+o(n)}" class="latex" title="ES(n)=2^{n+o(n)}" />. <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/259844/the-most-outrageous-or-ridiculous-conjectures-in-mathematics">Sometime ago I asked over MO a question on outrageous mathematical conjectures</a> and perhaps the conjecture that  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ES%28n%29+%3D+2%5E%7Bn-2%7D%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="ES(n) = 2^{n-2}+1" class="latex" title="ES(n) = 2^{n-2}+1" /> on the nose is an example.</p>

<h3>Henry Cohn, Abhinav Kumar, Stephen D. Miller, Danylo Radchenko, and Maryna Viazovska: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05438">Universal optimality of the E8 and Leech lattices and interpolation formulas</a></h3>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>We prove that the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E_8&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="E_8" class="latex" title="E_8" /> root lattice and the Leech lattice are universally optimal among point configurations in Euclidean spaces of dimensions 8 and 24, respectively. In other words, they minimize energy for every potential function that is a completely monotonic function of squared distance (for example, inverse power laws or Gaussians), which is a strong form of robustness not previously known for any configuration in more than one dimension. This theorem implies their recently shown optimality as sphere packings, and broadly generalizes it to allow for long-range interactions.</p>
<p>The proof uses sharp linear programming bounds for energy. To construct the optimal auxiliary functions used to attain these bounds, we prove a new interpolation theorem, which is of independent interest. It reconstructs a radial Schwartz function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> from the values and radial derivatives of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> and its Fourier transform <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat+f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\hat f" class="latex" title="\hat f" /> at the radii √2π for integers <em>n ≥ 1</em> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5E8&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^8" class="latex" title="R^8" /> and <em>n ≥ 2</em> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5E%7B24%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^{24}" class="latex" title="R^{24}" />. To prove this theorem, we construct an interpolation basis using integral transforms of quasimodular forms, generalizing Viazovska’s work on sphere packing and placing it in the context of a more conceptual theory.</p></div>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: In the subgraph counting problem, we are given a (large) graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%28V%2C+E%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="G(V, E)" class="latex" title="G(V, E)" /> and a (small) graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> (e.g., a triangle), and the goal is to estimate the number of occurrences of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" />. Our focus in this talk is on designing sublinear-time algorithms for approximately computing number of occurrences of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" /> in the setting where the algorithm is given query access to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" />. This problem has been studied in several recent work which primarily focused on specific families of graphs H such as triangles, cliques, and stars. However, not much is known about approximate counting of arbitrary graphs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> in the literature. This is in sharp contrast to the closely related subgraph enumeration problem in which the goal is to list all copies of the subgraph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" />. The AGM bound shows that the maximum number of occurrences of any arbitrary subgraph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> in a graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="m" class="latex" title="m" /> edges is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28m%5E%7Bp%28H%29%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="O(m^{p(H)})" class="latex" title="O(m^{p(H)})" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28H%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="p(H)" class="latex" title="p(H)" /> is the fractional edge cover number of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" />, and enumeration algorithms with matching runtime are known for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" />.</p>
<p>In this talk, we bridge this gap between the subgraph counting and subgraph enumeration problems and present a simple sublinear-time algorithm that estimates the number of occurrences of any arbitrary graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" />, denoted by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%23H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="\#H" class="latex" title="\#H" />, to within a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281+%5Cpm+%5Cvarepsilon%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="(1 \pm \varepsilon)" class="latex" title="(1 \pm \varepsilon)" />-approximation factor with high probability in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28m%5E%7Bp%28H%29%7D+%2F%5C%23H%29%5Ccdot+%5Ctext%7Bpoly%7D%28%5Clog+n%2C1%2F%5Cvarepsilon%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="O(m^{p(H)} /\#H)\cdot \text{poly}(\log n,1/\varepsilon)" class="latex" title="O(m^{p(H)} /\#H)\cdot \text{poly}(\log n,1/\varepsilon)" /> time. Our algorithm is allowed the standard set of queries for general graphs, namely degree queries, pair queries and neighbor queries, plus an additional edge-sample query that returns an edge chosen uniformly at random. The performance of our algorithm matches those of Eden et al. [FOCS 2015, STOC 2018] for counting triangles and cliques and extend them to all choices of subgraph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> under the additional assumption of edge-sample queries. Our results are also applicable to the more general problem of database join size estimation problem and for this slightly more general problem achieve optimal bounds for every choice of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" />.</p>

So you've got an iPhone XS in Space Grey. Congrats, so do 20 million other people. Maybe you have different cases but otherwise the hardware in all these phones are virtually identical. Yet you can tell with a glance that this is your phone. You can personalize apps and other elements of the home screen. It's your calendar and email and music.<br />
<br />
What? You've dropped your phone over Niagara falls. Luckily you've backed up your data. So you go back to Apple and buy another Space Grey iPhone XS and restore your data. Physically it's a completely different phone but for all practical purposes it's though you still had the original phone. Your phone is not defined by the device but the data that resides on it.<br />
<br />
It's not just phones. I can log into Google on anyone's Chrome browser and it will feel like my machine.<br />
<br />
Now we've all heard about a future world where nobody owns cars and we get driven around in self-driving Ubers, Lyfts and Waymos. One argument against this world is that people feel connected to their cars and unwilling to commute in some generic vehicle. But one can also imagine the car knows who you are, knows how you like your music, your lighting, how you adjust your seats even how your car drives. It becomes your car. Maybe even has electronic bumper stickers that change to support your political party.<br />
<br />
You can imagine the same for hotel rooms, your office, maybe even your apartment. It won't replicate your dog (or will it?) but as we get define more by our data than our things, do our things matter at all?</div>

<p>A few weeks ago, I was at <a href="http://jila.colorado.edu/qip2019/">QIP’2019</a> in Boulder, CO.  This week I was at <a href="http://physics.unm.edu/SQuInT/2019/index.php">SQuInT’2019</a> in Albuquerque, NM.  There were lots of amazing talks—feel free to ask in the comments section.</p>



<p>There’s an interview with me at the website “GigaOm,” conducted by Byron Reese and entitled <a href="https://gigaom.com/2019/01/17/quantum-computing-capabilities-and-limits-an-interview-with-scott-aaronson/">Quantum Computing: Capabilities and Limits</a>.  I didn’t proofread the transcript and it has some errors in it, but hopefully the meaning comes through.  In other interview news, if you were interested in my podcast with Adam Ford in Melbourne but don’t like YouTube, Adam has helpfully prepared transcripts of the two longest segments: <a href="http://www.scifuture.org/the-ghost-in-the-quantum-turing-machine-scott-aaronson/">The Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine</a> and <a href="http://www.scifuture.org/the-winding-road-to-quantum-supremacy-scott-aaronson/">The Winding Road to Quantum Supremacy</a>.</p>



<p>The <em>New York Times</em> ran an article entitled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/technology/computer-science-courses-college.html">The Hard Part of Computer Science? Getting Into Class</a>, about the surge in computer science majors all over the US, and the shortage of professors to teach them.  The article’s go-to example of a university where this is happening is UT Austin, and there’s extensive commentary from my department chair, Don Fussell.</p>



<p>The <a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2019/STOC%202019%20accepted%20papers.html">STOC’2019 accepted papers list</a> is finally out.  Lots of cool stuff!</p></div>

You've probably heard the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
               At first I didn't want to get an X but now that I have it, I can't imagine life without one.<br />
<br />
X could be telegraph, radio, TV, color TV, VCR, CD player, streaming, Netflix, Amazon prime, an uber account, Washer and Dryer, Car Phones (remember those), Cell Phones. If you go back in history  wrist watches or sun dials (or wrist-sun-dials!).<br />
<br />
This has happened to me recently though not with an object. I read an article someplace saying that ze can be used instead of he or she. It was referring to nonbinaries (using `they' never quite sounded right) but actually it would be great if this was a general genderless pronoun. I am not making a political statement here (although I doubt I have any readers who are against genderless pronouns).<br />
<br />
Once I came across the term ze I found places to use it and now I can't imagine not using it.<br />
<br />
In a recent article I wrote I needed to say that someone was probably confused, but I did not know their gender. I used<br />
<br />
                                                         Ze was probably confused<br />
<br />
which is much better than<br />
<br />
                                                         S/he was probably confused<br />
<br />
                                                         He or she was probably confused<br />
<br />
                                                         The student was probably confused<br />
<br />
                                                         They were probably confused.<br />
<br />
Note that the first two leave out nonbinaries.<br />
<br />
0) In the article I put in a footnote saying what ze meant. In the future I may not have to.<br />
<br />
1) Will ze catch on? This blog post is an attempt to hasten the practice.<br />
<br />
2) Is there a term for his/her that is non-gendered? If not then maybe zer.<br />
<br />
3) Will there be political pushback on this usage? If its phrased as a way to include nonbinaries than unfortunately yes. If its phrased as above as when you don't know the gender, what do you do, then no.<br />
<br />
4) Is <i> nonbinary </i>the correct term? If not then please politely correct me in the comments.<br />
<br />
5) Has Ms replaced Miss and Mrs?<br />
<br />
I have used the term ze several times since then- often when I get email from a student such that I can't tell from the first name what their gender is, and I need to forward the email, such as<br />
<br />
                   Ze wants to take honors discrete math but does not have the prerequisite, but<br />
                   since ze placed in the top five in the math olympiad, we'll let zer take it.<br />

<p>The other day I was derailed by this tweet from Fermat’s Library:</p>
<p><img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/inverse-factorial-tweet.png" height="385" width="592" alt="Inverse factorial tweet" border="0" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<p class="undent">The moment I saw it, I had to stop in my tracks, grab a scratch pad, and check out the formula. The result made sense in a rough-and-ready sort of way. Since the multiplicative version of \(n!\) goes to infinity as \(n\) increases, the “divisive” version should go to zero. And \(\frac{n^2}{n!}\) does exactly that; the polynomial function \(n^2\) grows slower than the exponential function \(n!\) for large enough \(n\):</p>
<p>\[\frac{1}{1}, \frac{4}{2}, \frac{9}{6}, \frac{16}{24}, \frac{25}{120}, \frac{36}{720}, \frac{49}{5040}, \frac{64}{40320}, \frac{81}{362880}, \frac{100}{3628800}.\]</p>
<p class="undent">But why does the quotient take the particular form \(\frac{n^2}{n!}\)? Where does the \(n^2\) come from?</p>
<p>To answer that question, I had to revisit the long-ago trauma of learning to divide fractions, but I pushed through the pain. Proceeding from left to right through the formula in the tweet, we first get \(\frac{n}{n-1}\). Then, dividing that quantity by \(n-2\) yields</p>
<p>\[\cfrac{\frac{n}{n-1}}{n-2} = \frac{n}{(n-1)(n-2)}.\]</p>
<p class="undent">Continuing in the same way, we ultimately arrive at:</p>
<p>\[n \mathbin{/} (n-1) \mathbin{/} (n-2) \mathbin{/} (n-3) \mathbin{/} \cdots \mathbin{/} 1 = \frac{n}{(n-1) (n-2) (n-3) \cdots 1} = \frac{n}{(n-1)!}\]</p>
<p class="undent">To recover the tweet’s stated result of \(\frac{n^2}{n!}\), just multiply numerator and denominator by \(n\). (To my taste, however, \(\frac{n}{(n-1)!}\) is the more perspicuous expression.)</p>
<hr />
<p>I am a card-carrying factorial fanboy. You can keep your fancy Fibonaccis; <em>this</em> is my favorite function. Every time I try out a new programming language, my first exercise is to write a few routines for calculating factorials. Over the years I have pondered several variations on the theme, such as replacing \(\times\) with \(+\) in the definition (which produces triangular numbers). But I don’t think I’ve ever before considered substituting \(\mathbin{/}\) for \(\times\). It’s messy. Because multiplication is commutative and associative, you can define \(n!\) simply as the product of all the integers from \(1\) through \(n\), without worrying about the order of the operations. With division, order can’t be ignored. In general, \(x \mathbin{/} y \ne y \mathbin{/}x\), and \((x \mathbin{/} y) \mathbin{/} z \ne x \mathbin{/} (y \mathbin{/} z)\).</p>
<p>The Fermat’s Library tweet puts the factors in descending order: \(n, n-1, n-2, \ldots, 1\). The most obvious alternative is the ascending sequence \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, n\). What happens if we define the divisive factorial as \(1 \mathbin{/} 2 \mathbin{/}  3 \mathbin{/} \cdots \mathbin{/} n\)? Another visit to the schoolroom algorithm for dividing fractions yields this simple answer:</p>
<p>\[1 \mathbin{/} 2 \mathbin{/}  3 \mathbin{/} \cdots \mathbin{/} n = \frac{1}{2 \times 3 \times 4 \times \cdots \times n} = \frac{1}{n!}.\]</p>
<p class="undent">In other words, when we repeatedly divide while counting up from \(1\) to \(n\), the final quotient is the reciprocal of \(n!\).  (I wish I could put an exclamation point at the end of that sentence!) If you’re looking for a canonical answer to the question, “What do you get if you divide instead of multiplying in \(n!\)?” I would argue that \(\frac{1}{n!}\) is a better candidate than \(\frac{n}{(n - 1)!}\). Why not embrace the symmetry between \(n!\) and its inverse?</p>
<p>Of course there are many other ways to arrange the <em>n</em> integers in the set \(\{1 \ldots n\}\). How many ways? As it happens, \(n!\) of them! Thus it would seem there are \(n!\) distinct ways to define the divisive \(n!\) function. However, looking at the answers for the two permutations discussed above suggests there’s a simpler pattern at work. Whatever element of the sequence happens to come first winds up in the numerator of a big fraction, and the denominator is the product of all the other elements. As a result, there are really only \(n\) different outcomes—assuming we stick to performing the division operations from left to right. For any integer \(k\) between \(1\) and \(n\), putting \(k\) at the head of the queue creates a divisive \(n!\) equal to \(k\) divided by all the other factors. We can write this out as:</p>
<p>\[\cfrac{k}{\frac{n!}{k}}, \text{ which can be rearranged as } \frac{k^2}{n!}.\]</p>
<p class="undent">And thus we also solve the minor mystery of how \(\frac{n}{(n-1)!}\) became \(\frac{n^2}{n!}\) in the tweet.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that all of these functions converge to zero as \(n\) goes to infinity. Asymptotically speaking, \(\frac{1^2}{n!}, \frac{2^2}{n!}, \ldots, \frac{n^2}{n!}\) are all alike.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ta dah! Mission accomplished. Problem solved. Done and dusted. Now we know everything there is to know about divisive factorials, right?</p>
<p>Well, maybe there’s one more question. What does the computer say? If you take your favorite factorial algorithm, and do as the tweet suggests, replacing any appearance of the \(\times\) (or <code>*</code>) operator with <code>/</code>, what happens? Which of the \(n\) variants of divisive \(n!\) does the program produce?</p>
<p>Here’s <em>my</em> favorite algorithm for computing factorials, in the form of a <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> program:</p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>function mul!(n)
    if n == 1
        return 1
    else
        return n * mul!(n - 1)
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>This is the algorithm that has introduced generations of nerds to the concept of recursion. In narrative form it says: If \(n\) is \(1\), then \(mul!(n)\) is \(1\). Otherwise, evaluate the function \(mul!(n-1)\), then multiply the result by \(n\). You might ask what happens if \(n\) is zero or negative. You might ask, but please don’t. For present purposes, \(n \in \mathbb{N}\).Starting with any positive \(n\), the sequence of recursive calls must eventually bottom out with \(n = 1\).</p>
<p>The function can be written more tersely using Julia’s one-liner style of definition:.</p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>mul!(n)  =  n == 1 ? 1 : n * mul!(n - 1)</code></pre>
<p>The right side of the assignment statement is a conditional expression, or ternary operator, which has the form <code>a ? b : c</code>. Here <code>a</code> is a boolean test clause, which must return a value of either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. If <code>a</code> is <code>true</code>, clause <code>b</code> is evaluated, and the result becomes the value of the entire expression. Otherwise clause <code>c</code> is evaluated.</p>
<p>Just to be sure I’ve got this right, here are the first 10 factorials, as calculated by this program:</p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>[mul!(n) for n in 1:10]
10-element Array{Int64,1}:
       1
       2
       6
      24
     120
     720
    5040
   40320
  362880
 3628800</code></pre>
<p class="indent">Now let’s edit that definition and convert the single occurence of <code>*</code> to a <code>/</code>, leaving everything else (except the name of the function) unchanged.</p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>div!(n)  =  n == 1 ? 1 : n / div!(n - 1)</code></pre>
<p>And here’s what comes back when we run the program for values of \(n\) from \(1\) through \(20\):</p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>[div!(n) for n in 1:20]
20-element Array{Real,1}:
 1

<p>Huh? That sure doesn’t look like it’s converging to zero—not as \(\frac{1}{n!}\) or as \(\frac{n}{n - 1}\). As a matter of fact, it doesn’t look like it’s going to converge at all. The graph below suggests the sequence is made up of two alternating components, both of which appear to be slowly growing toward infinity as well as diverging from one another.</p>

<p class="indent">In trying to make sense of what we’re seeing here, it helps to change the output type of the <code>div!</code> function. Instead of applying the division operator <code>/</code>, which returns the quotient as a floating-point number, we can substitute the  <code>//</code> operator, which returns an exact rational quotient, reduced to lowest terms.</p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>div!(n)  =  n == 1 ? 1 : n // div!(n - 1)</code></pre>
<p class="undent">Here’s the sequence of values for <code>n in 1:20</code>:</p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>20-element Array{Real,1}:

<p>The list is full of curious patterns. It’s a double helix, with even numbers and odd numbers zigzagging in complementary strands. The even numbers are not just even; they are all powers of \(2\). Also, they appear in pairs—first in the numerator, then in the denominator—and their sequence is nondecreasing. But there are gaps; not all powers of \(2\) are present. The odd strand looks even more complicated, with various small prime factors flitting in and out of the numbers. (The primes <em>have</em> to be small—smaller than \(n\), anyway.)</p>
<p>This outcome took me by surprise. I had really expected to see a much tamer sequence, like those I worked out with pencil and paper. All those jagged, jitterbuggy ups and downs made no sense. Nor did the overall trend of unbounded growth in the ratio. How could you keep dividing and dividing, and wind up with bigger and bigger numbers?</p>
<p>At this point you may want to pause before reading on, and try to work out your own theory of where these zigzag numbers are coming from. If you need a hint, you can get a strong one—almost a spoiler—by looking up the sequence of numerators or the sequence of denominators in the <a href="http://oeis.org">Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here’s another hint. A small edit to the <code>div!</code> program completely transforms the output. Just flip the final clause, changing <code>n // div!(n - 1)</code> into <code>div!(n - 1) // n</code>. </p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>div!(n)  =  n == 1 ? 1 : div!(n - 1) // n</code></pre>
<p class="undent">Now the results look like this:</p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>10-element Array{Real,1}:

 1//40320              
 1//362880             
 1//3628800</code></pre>
<p>This is the inverse factorial function we’ve already seen, the series of quotients generated when you march left to right through an ascending sequence of divisors \(1 \mathbin{/} 2 \mathbin{/}  3 \mathbin{/} \cdots \mathbin{/} n\). </p>
<p>It’s no surprise that flipping the final clause in the procedure alters the outcome. After all, we know that division is not commutative or associative. What’s not so easy to see is why the sequence of quotients generated by the original program takes that weird zigzag form. What mechanism is giving rise to those paired powers of 2 and the alternation of odd and even?</p>
<p>I have found that it’s easier to explain what’s going on in the zigzag sequence when I describe an iterative version of the procedure, rather than the recursive one. (This is an embarrassing admission for someone who has argued that recursive definitions are easier to reason about, but there you have it.) Here’s the program:</p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>function div!_iter(n)
    q = 1
    for i in 1:n
        q = i // q
    end
    return q
end</code></pre>
<p>I submit that this looping procedure is operationally identical to the recursive function, in the sense that if <code>div!(n)</code> and <code>div!_iter(n)</code> both return a result for some positive integer <code>n</code>, it will always be the same result. Here’s my evidence: </p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>[div!(n) for n in 1:20]    [div!_iter(n) for n in 1:20]
            1                         1//1

<p>To understand the process that gives rise to these numbers, consider the successive values of the variables \(i\) and \(q\) each time the loop is executed. Initially, \(i\) and \(q\) are both set to \(1\); hence, after the first passage through the loop, the statement <code>q = i // q</code> gives \(q\) the value \(\frac{1}{1}\). Next time around, \(i = 2\) and \(q = \frac{1}{1}\), so \(q\)’s new value is \(\frac{2}{1}\). On the third iteration, \(i = 3\) and \(q = \frac{2}{1}\), yielding \(\frac{i}{q} \rightarrow \frac{3}{2}\). If this is still confusing, try thinking of \(\frac{i}{q}\) as \(i \times \frac{1}{q}\). The crucial observation is that on every passage through the loop, \(q\) is inverted, becoming \(\frac{1}{q}\).</p>
<p>If you unwind these operations, and look at the multiplications and divisions that go into each element of the series, a pattern emerges:</p>
<p>\[\frac{1}{1}, \quad \frac{2}{1}, \quad \frac{1 \cdot 3}{2}, \quad \frac{2 \cdot 4}{1 \cdot 3}, \quad \frac{1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 4} \quad \frac{2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6}{1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5}\]</p>
<p class="undent">The general form is:</p>
<p>\[\frac{1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot \cdots \cdot n}{2 \cdot 4 \cdot \cdots \cdot (n-1)} \quad (\text{odd } n) \qquad  \frac{2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 \cdot \cdots \cdot n}{1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot \cdots \cdot (n-1)} \quad (\text{even } n).<br />
\]</p>
<hr />
<p>The functions \(1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot \cdots \cdot n\) for odd \(n\) and \(2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 \cdot \cdots \cdot n\) for even \(n\) have a name! They are known as double factorials, with the notation \(n!!\). Terrible terminology, no? Better to have named them “semi-factorials.” And if I didn’t know better, I would read \(n!!\) as “the factorial of the factorial.” The double factorial of <em>n</em> is defined as the product of <em>n</em> and all smaller positive integers of the same parity. Thus our peculiar sequence of zigzag quotients is simply \(\frac{n!!}{(n-1)!!}\).</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4169/math.mag.85.3.177">2012 article</a> by Henry W. Gould and Jocelyn Quaintance (behind a paywall, regrettably) surveys the applications of double factorials. They turn up more often than you might guess. In the middle of the 17th century John Wallis came up with this identity:</p>
<p>\[\frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 6 \cdots}{1 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdots} = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{((2n)!!)^2}{(2n + 1)!!(2n - 1)!!}\]</p>
<p class="undent">An even weirder series, involving the cube of a quotient of double factorials, sums to \(\frac{2}{\pi}\). That one was discovered by (who else?) Srinivasa Ramanujan.</p>
<p>Gould and Quaintance also discuss the double factorial counterpart of binomial coefficients. The standard binomial coefficient is defined as:</p>
<p>\[\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}.\]</p>
<p class="undent">The double version is:</p>
<p>\[\left(\!\binom{n}{k}\!\right) = \frac{n!!}{k!! (n-k)!!}.\]</p>
<p class="undent">Note that our zigzag numbers fit this description and therefore qualify as double factorial binomial coefficients. Specifically, they are the numbers:</p>
<p>\[\left(\!\binom{n}{1}\!\right) = \left(\!\binom{n}{n - 1}\!\right) = \frac{n!!}{1!! (n-1)!!}.\]</p>
<p class="undent">The regular binomial \(\binom{n}{1}\) is not very interesting; it is simply equal to \(n\). But the doubled version \(\left(\!\binom{n}{1}\!\right)\), as we’ve seen, dances a livelier jig. And, unlike the single binomial, it is not always an integer. (The only integer values are \(1\) and \(2\).)</p>
<p>Seeing the zigzag numbers as ratios of double factorials explains quite a few of their properties, starting with the alternation of evens and odds. We can also see why all the even numbers in the sequence are powers of 2. Consider the case of \(n = 6\). The numerator of this fraction is \(2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 = 48\), which acquires a factor of \(3\) from the \(6\). But the denominator is \(1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 15\). The \(3\)s above and below cancel, leaving \(\frac{16}{5}\). Such cancelations will happen in every case. Whenever an odd factor \(m\) enters the even sequence, it must do so in the form \(2 \cdot m\), but at that point \(m\) itself must already be present in the odd sequence.</p>
<hr />
<p>Is the sequence of zigzag numbers a reasonable answer to the question, “What happens when you divide instead of multiply in \(n!\)?” Or is the computer program that generates them just a buggy algorithm? My personal judgment is that \(\frac{1}{n!}\) is a more intuitive answer, but \(\frac{n!!}{(n - 1)!!}\) is more interesting.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the mere existence of the zigzag sequence broadens our horizons. As noted above, if you insist that the division algorithm must always chug along the list of \(n\) factors in order, at each stop dividing the number on the left by the number on the right, then there are only \(n\) possible outcomes, and they all look much alike. But the zigzag solution suggests wilder possibilities. We can formulate the task as follows. Take the set of factors \(\{1 \dots n\}\), select a subset, and invert all the elements of that subset; now multiply all the factors, both the inverted and the upright ones. If the inverted subset is empty, the result is the ordinary factorial \(n!\). If <em>all</em> of the factors are inverted, we get the inverse \(\frac{1}{n!}\). And if every second factor is inverted, starting with \(n - 1\), the result is an element of the zigzag sequence.</p>
<p>These are only a few among the many possible choices; in total there are \(2^n\) subsets of \(n\) items. For example, you might invert every number that is prime or a power of a prime \((2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, \dots)\). For small \(n\), the result jumps around but remains consistently less than \(1\):</p>
<p><img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/prime-powers.svg" height="" width="" alt="Prime powers" border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p class="undent">If I were to continue this plot to larger \(n\), however, it would take off for the stratosphere. Prime powers get sparse farther out on the number line.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here’s a question. We’ve seen factorial variants that go to zero as \(n\) goes to infinity, such as \(1/n!\). We’ve seen other variants grow without bound as \(n\) increases, including \(n!\) itself, and the zigzag numbers. Are there any versions of the factorial process that converge to a finite bound other than zero?</p>
<p>My first thought was this algorithm:</p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>function greedy_balance(n)
    q = 1
    while n &gt; 0
        q = q &gt; 1 ? q /= n : q *= n
        n -= 1
    end
    return q
end</code></pre>
<p class="undent">We loop through the integers from \(n\) down to \(1\), calculating the running product/quotient \(q\) as we go. At each step, if the current value of \(q\) is greater than \(1\), we divide by the next factor; otherwise, we multiply. This scheme implements a kind of feedback control or target-seeking behavior. If \(q\) gets too large, we reduce it; too small and we increase it. I conjectured that as \(n\) goes to infinity, \(q\) would settle into an ever-narrower range of values near \(1\).</p>
<p>Running the experiment gave me another surprise:</p>
<p><img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/greedy_balance_linear.svg" height="" width="" alt="Greedy balance linear" border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p class="undent">That sawtooth wave is not quite what I expected. One minor peculiarity is that the curve is not symmetric around \(1\); the excursions above have higher amplitude than those below. But this distortion is more visual than mathematical. Because \(q\) is a ratio, the distance from \(1\) to \(10\) is the same as the distance from \(1\) to \(\frac{1}{10}\), but it doesn’t look that way on a linear scale. The remedy is to plot the log of the ratio:</p>
<p><img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/greedy_balance.svg" height="" width="" alt="Greedy balance" border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p>Now the graph is symmetric, or at least approximately so, centered on \(0\), which is the logarithm of \(1\). But a larger mystery remains. The sawtooth waveform is very regular, with a period of \(4\), and it shows no obvious signs of shrinking toward the expected limiting value of \(\log q = 0\). Numerical evidence suggests that as \(n\) goes to infinity the peaks of this curve converge on a value just above \(q = \frac{5}{3}\), and the troughs approach a value just below \(q = \frac{3}{5}\). (The corresponding base-\(10\) logarithms are roughly \(\pm0.222\). I have not worked out why this should be so. Perhaps someone will explain it to me.</p>
<p>The failure of this greedy algorithm doesn’t mean we can’t find a divisive factorial that converges to \(q = 1\). If we work with the logarithms of the factors, this procedure becomes an instance of a well-known compu­tational problem called the number partitioning problem. You are given a set of real numbers and asked to divide it into two sets whose sums are equal, or as close to equal as possible. It’s a certifiably hard problem, but it has also been called (<a href="http://bit-player.org/bph-publications/AmSci-2002-03-Hayes-NPP.pdf">PDF</a>) “the easiest hard problem.”For any given \(n\), we might find that inverting some other subset of the factors gives a better approximation to \(n! = 1\). For small \(n\), we can solve the problem by brute force: Just look at all \(2^n\) subsets and pick the best one.</p>
<p>I have computed the optimal partitionings up to \(n = 30\), where there are a billion possibilities to choose from.</p>
<p><img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/optimum_balance_graph.svg" height="" width="" alt="Optimum balance graph" border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p class="undent">The graph is clearly flatlining. You could use the same method to force convergence to any other value between \(0\) and \(n!\).</p>
<p>And thus we have yet another answer to the question in the tweet that launched this adventure. What happens when you divide instead of multiply in n!? Anything you want.</p></div>

<div class="content">
<p>I recently wrote here about <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2018/09/05/big-convex-polygons.html">big convex polygons in grids</a>, a problem for which we know very precise answers. This naturally raises the question: what about higher dimensions? How many vertices can be part of a convex polyhedron in an  grid, or more generally a convex polytope in a -dimensional grid of side length ? Here we do still know some pretty good answers, at least up to constant factors in spaces of constant dimension.</p>

<p>The problem is included in a 2008 survey by Imre Bárány,<sup id="fnref:bar"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/02/09/big-convex-polyhedra.html#fn:bar" class="footnote">1</a></sup> according to whom the maximum number of vertices is</p>



<p>For instance, in three dimensional  grids the maximum number of vertices is .</p>

<p>One way to find polyhedra with this many vertices is to take the convex hull of the points in a ball,<sup id="fnref:bl"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/02/09/big-convex-polyhedra.html#fn:bl" class="footnote">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:bd"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/02/09/big-convex-polyhedra.html#fn:bd" class="footnote">3</a></sup> or in scaled copies of any fixed smooth convex body. Another way, which should generate polyhedra with a somewhat less irregular appearance and (up to constant factors) the same number of vertices, is to take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_addition">Minkowski sum</a> of all line segments (up to scaling and translation) that will fit into a smaller grid, of side length . For instance, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_rhombicuboctahedron">truncated rhombicuboctahedron</a> below<sup id="fnref:ruen"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/02/09/big-convex-polyhedra.html#fn:ruen" class="footnote">4</a></sup> is the Minkowski sum of all the line segments that fit into a unit cube. Its 96 vertices lie in a  grid. In general, this method produces a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zonohedron">zonohedron</a> whose complexity can be analyzed in terms of a -dimensional arrangement of  hyperplanes. As long as this arrangement is not too degenerate (which it appears not to be, but I haven’t worked out the details carefully) this should give
a number of vertices within a constant factor of the number coming from the convex hull construction.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/truncated-rhombicuboctahedron2.png" alt="Truncated rhombicuboctahedron" /></p>

<p>A matching upper bound comes from a 1963 paper by G. K. Andrews,<sup id="fnref:and"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/02/09/big-convex-polyhedra.html#fn:and" class="footnote">5</a></sup> and Bárány writes that although several more proofs have been published none of them is easy. I’m not sure whether the difficulty is in getting the exact bound or in the fact that Andrews and the later proofs allow more general shapes with volume  that don’t fit into a grid, but it’s not hard to get close to the right bound simply by counting the number of possible facets of a given volume . By using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenstra%E2%80%93Lenstra%E2%80%93Lov%C3%A1sz_lattice_basis_reduction_algorithm">lattice basis reduction</a> the integer vectors in the hyperplane through any facet have a nearly-orthogonal basis whose product of lengths is proportional to . By considering how this product of lengths can be broken down into factors of different scales, and counting how many integer vectors of those lengths exist, it follows that the number of possible facets of volume  is . Combining this with the  surface area of a grid polytope gives the correct upper bound on the number of vertices up to a polylog factor.</p>

<p>What about when the dimension is not constant? An easy construction for high dimensions is to take all points with a fixed distance  from the grid center. There are  possible values for the distance, so this construction produces a convex polytope with  vertices. It comes from a 1946 paper by Behrend, who uses this idea to find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem%E2%80%93Spencer_set">dense sets of integers with no arithmetic progressions</a>.<sup id="fnref:beh"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/02/09/big-convex-polyhedra.html#fn:beh" class="footnote">6</a></sup>
It is never worse to use the convex hull of the ball than the points on a sphere,
and a celebrated paper by Elkin from 2011 (in the appendix of the published version) gives another proof of the  bound for convex hulls of balls (for ) in which the constant factor of the  is universal, not depending on . So when  is singly exponential in ,  becomes constant and the convex hull technique produces  vertices, improving Behrend’s construction for progression-free sets by the same  factor.<sup id="fnref:elk"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/02/09/big-convex-polyhedra.html#fn:elk" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Minimax Testing of Identity to a Reference Ergodic Markov Chain</strong>, by Geoffrey Wolfer and Aryeh Kontorovich (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00080">arXiv</a>). This work studies distributional identity testing on Markov chains from a single trajectory, as recently introduced by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06850">Daskalakis, Dikkala, and Gravin</a>: we wish to test whether a Markov chain is equal to some reference chain, or far from it. This improves on previous work by considering a stronger distance measure than before, and showing that the sample complexity only depends on properties of the reference chain (which we are trying to test identity to). It additionally proves instance-by-instance bounds (where the sample complexity depends on properties of the specific chain we wish to test identity to).</p>



<p><strong>Almost Optimal Distribution-free Junta Testing</strong>, by Nader H. Bshouty (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00717">arXiv</a>). This paper provides a \(\tilde O(k/\varepsilon)\)-query algorithm with two-sided error for testing if a Boolean function is a \(k\)-junta (that is, its value depends only on \(k\) of its variables) in the distribution-free model (where distance is measured with respect to an unknown distribution from which we can sample). This complexity is a quadratic improvement over the \(\tilde O(k^2)/\varepsilon\)-query algorithm of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04859">Chen, Liu, Servedio, Sheng, and Xie</a>. This complexity is also near-optimal, as shown in a lower bound by Saglam (which we covered back in <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/?p=1030">August</a>).</p>



<p><strong>Exponentially Faster Massively Parallel Maximal Matching</strong>, by Soheil Behnezhad, MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi, and David G. Harris (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03744">arXiv</a>). The authors consider maximal matching in the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model. They show that one can compute a maximal matching in \(O(\log \log \Delta)\)-rounds, with \(O(n)\) space per machine. This is an exponential improvement over the previous works, which required either \(\Omega(\log n)\) rounds or \(n^{1 + \Omega(1)}\) space per machine. Corollaries of their result include approximation algorithms for vertex cover, maximum matching, and weighted maximum matching. </p></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three things for members of our community to note:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important vote (once the link goes out; note that the current email is just an announcement and an invitation for additional candidates to petition to be included on the ballot). The SIG leadership is very important for the ongoing direction of our organization. Your vote makes a difference, because our elections are often decided by small margins.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">If you didn’t get this email, you’re likely not registered as a member of our SIG. Membership costs only $5 for students and $10 for others; AFAIK, you don’t have to be an ACM member to be a SIG member. Our number of members is an important signal to the ACM about the strength of our community (which is why we have set our fees so low). Votes like this one are also restricted to members! If your membership has lapsed, or if you’ve never taken the plunge, this might be a good occasion to do so, by clicking on the link below:</li>

<ol start="3">
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to our nominations chair, David Parkes, who put together the slate of candidates just listed, and also to all of the candidates who agreed to serve. Our community is really lucky to have such a strong and deep pool of volunteers, and this is one more example. Indeed, in advance, I’d particularly like to thank those candidates who *don’t* win, whoever they turn out to be: it’s thankless to stick one’s neck out for an election only to see someone else get chosen (often by a small margin; see #1), but your willingness to serve is much appreciated.</li>

We study the Fourier spectrum of functions $f\colon \{0,1\}^{mk} \to \{-1,0,1\}$ which can be written as a product of $k$ Boolean functions $f_i$ on disjoint $m$-bit inputs.  We prove that for every positive integer $d$,
\[
  \sum_{S \subseteq [mk]: |S|=d} |\hat{f_S}| = O(m)^d .
\]
Our upper bound is tight up to a constant factor in the $O(\cdot)$.  Our proof builds on a new "level-$d$ inequality" that bounds above $\sum_{|S|=d} \hat{f_S}^2$ for any $[0,1]$-valued function $f$ in terms of its expectation, which may be of independent interest.

As a result, we construct pseudorandom generators for such functions with seed length $\tilde O(m + \log(k/\varepsilon))$, which is optimal up to polynomial factors in $\log m$, $\log\log k$ and $\log\log(1/\varepsilon)$.  Our generator in particular works for the well-studied class of combinatorial rectangles, where in addition we allow the bits to be read in any order.  Even for this special case, previous generators have an extra $\tilde O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ factor in their seed lengths. 

Using Schur-convexity, we also extend our results to functions $f_i$ whose range is $[-1,1]$.</div>

We study the approximation of halfspaces $h:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ in the infinity norm by polynomials and rational functions of any given degree.  Our main result is an explicit construction of the "hardest" halfspace, for which we prove polynomial and rational approximation lower bounds that match the trivial upper bounds achievable for all halfspaces.  This completes a lengthy line of work started by Myhill and Kautz (1961).

As an application, we construct a communication problem with essentially the largest possible gap, of $n$ versus $2^{-\Omega(n)},$ between the sign-rank and discrepancy. Equivalently, our problem exhibits a gap of $\log n$ versus $\Omega(n)$ between the communication complexity with unbounded versus weakly unbounded error, improving quadratically on previous constructions and completing a line of work started by Babai, Frankl, and Simon (FOCS 1986). Our results further generalize to the $k$-party number-on-the-forehead model, where we obtain an explicit separation of $\log n$ versus $\Omega(n/4^{n})$ for communication with unbounded versus weakly unbounded error. This gap is a quadratic improvement on previous work and matches the state of the art for number-on-the-forehead lower bounds.</div>

As a grad student in the late 80's I had the opportunity to witness many great and often surprising theorems in computational complexity. Let me tell you about one of them, the Immerman-Szelepcsényi result that <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2003/06/foundations-of-complexity-lesson-19.html">nondeterministic space is closed under complement</a>. I wish I had the original emails for this story but instead I'm working from memory and apologies if I get some of the details wrong. I'm expanding from a <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2002/08/last-spring-i-saw-copenhagen-great.html">short version</a> from the early days of this blog.<br />
<br />
I started my graduate work at UC Berkeley in 1985 and then moved to MIT in the summer of '86, following my advisor Michael Sipser. In the summer of 1987, Neil Immerman, then at Yale, proved his famous result building on his work in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_complexity_theory">descriptive complexity</a> In those days you didn't email papers, he made copies and sent them by US postal mail to several major researchers in complexity including Sipser. But Sipser was away for the summer, I believe in Russia, and the paper sat in his office.<br />
<br />
Immerman also sent the paper to a Berkeley professor, probably Manuel Blum, who gave it to one of his students who decided to speak about the result in a student-led seminar. I forgot who was the student, maybe Moni Naor. I was still on the Berkeley email list so I got the talk announcement and went into complexity ecstasy over the news. I asked Moni (or whomever was giving the talk) if he could tell me details and he sent me a nice write-up of the proof. Given the importance of the result, I sent the proof write-up out to the MIT theory email list.<br />
<br />
Guess who was on the MIT theory list? Neil Immerman. Neil wrote back with his own explanation of the proof. Neil explained how it came out of descriptive complexity but as a pure write-up of a proof of the theorem, Moni did an excellent job.<br />
<br />
We found out about Robert Szelepcsényi when his paper showed up a few months later in the Bulletin of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science. Szelepcsényi came to the problem from formal languages, whether context-sensitive languages (nondeterministic linear space) was closed under complement. Szelepcsényi, an undergrad in Slovakia at the time, heard about the problem in a class he took. Szelepcsényi's proof was very similar to Immerman. Szelepcsényi's paper took longer to get to US researchers but likely was proven and written about the same time as Immerman.<br />
<br />
Even though both papers were <a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/0217058">published</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00299636">separately</a> we refer to the result as Immerman-Szelepcsényi and is now just some old important theorem you see in introductory theory classes.</div>

We prove a query complexity lower bound for $QMA$ protocols that solve approximate counting: estimating the size of a set given a membership oracle. This gives rise to an oracle $A$ such that $SBP^A \not\subset QMA^A$, resolving an open problem of Aaronson [2]. Our proof uses the polynomial method to derive a lower bound for the $SBQP$ query complexity of the $AND$ of two approximate counting instances. We use Laurent polynomials as a tool in our proof, showing that the "Laurent polynomial method" can be useful even for problems involving ordinary polynomials.</div>
