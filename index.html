Woodruff</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05832">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>We consider the communication complexity of a number of distributed
optimization problems. We start with the problem of solving a linear system.
Suppose there is a coordinator together with $s$ servers $P_1, \ldots, P_s$,
the $i$-th of which holds a subset $A^{(i)} x = b^{(i)}$ of $n_i$ constraints
of a linear system in $d$ variables, and the coordinator would like to output
$x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ for which $A^{(i)} x = b^{(i)}$ for $i = 1, \ldots, s$. We
assume each coefficient of each constraint is specified using $L$ bits. We
first resolve the randomized and deterministic communication complexity in the
point-to-point model of communication, showing it is $\tilde{\Theta}(d^2L +
sd)$ and $\tilde{\Theta}(sd^2L)$, respectively. We obtain similar results for
the blackboard model.
</p>
<p>When there is no solution to the linear system, a natural alternative is to
find the solution minimizing the $\ell_p$ loss. While this problem has been
studied, we give improved upper or lower bounds for every value of $p \ge 1$.
One takeaway message is that sampling and sketching techniques, which are
commonly used in earlier work on distributed optimization, are neither optimal
in the dependence on $d$ nor on the dependence on the approximation $\epsilon$,
thus motivating new techniques from optimization to solve these problems.
</p>
<p>Towards this end, we consider the communication complexity of optimization
tasks which generalize linear systems. For linear programming, we first resolve
the communication complexity when $d$ is constant, showing it is
$\tilde{\Theta}(sL)$ in the point-to-point model. For general $d$ and in the
point-to-point model, we show an $\tilde{O}(sd^3 L)$ upper bound and an
$\tilde{\Omega}(d^2 L + sd)$ lower bound. We also show if one perturbs the
coefficients randomly by numbers as small as $2^{-\Theta(L)}$, then the upper
bound is $\tilde{O}(sd^2 L) + \textrm{poly}(dL)$.

\times d}$ via matrix-vector products, namely, the algorithm chooses vectors
$\mathbf{v}^1, \ldots, \mathbf{v}^q$, and observes $M\mathbf{v}^1,\ldots,
M\mathbf{v}^q$. Here the $\mathbf{v}^i$ can be randomized as well as chosen
adaptively as a function of $ M\mathbf{v}^1,\ldots,M\mathbf{v}^{i-1}$.
Motivated by applications of sketching in distributed computation, linear
algebra, and streaming models, as well as connections to areas such as
communication complexity and property testing, we initiate the study of the
number $q$ of queries needed to solve various fundamental problems. We study
problems in three broad categories, including linear algebra, statistics
problems, and graph problems. For example, we consider the number of queries
required to approximate the rank, trace, maximum eigenvalue, and norms of a
matrix $M$; to compute the AND/OR/Parity of each column or row of $M$, to
decide whether there are identical columns or rows in $M$ or whether $M$ is
symmetric, diagonal, or unitary; or to compute whether a graph defined by $M$
is connected or triangle-free. We also show separations for algorithms that are
allowed to obtain matrix-vector products only by querying vectors on the right,
versus algorithms that can query vectors on both the left and the right. We
also show separations depending on the underlying field the matrix-vector
product occurs in. For graph problems, we show separations depending on the
form of the matrix (bipartite adjacency versus signed edge-vertex incidence
matrix) to represent the graph.
</p>
<p>Surprisingly, this fundamental model does not appear to have been studied on
its own, and we believe a thorough investigation of problems in this model
would be beneficial to a number of different application areas.

Often these can be thought of representing a real-valued function on a
high-dimensional domain, and can be conceptually arranged in the format of a
tensor of high degree in some truncated or lossy compressed format. We look at
some common post-processing tasks which are not obvious in the compressed
format, as such huge data sets can not be stored in their entirety, and the
value of an element is not readily accessible through simple look-up. The tasks
we consider are finding the location of maximum or minimum, or minimum and
maximum of a function of the data, or finding the indices of all elements in
some interval --- i.e. level sets, the number of elements with a value in such
a level set, the probability of an element being in a particular level set, and
the mean and variance of the total collection.
</p>
<p>The algorithms to be described are fixed point iterations of particular
functions of the tensor, which will then exhibit the desired result. For this,
the data is considered as an element of a high degree tensor space, although in
an abstract sense, the algorithms are independent of the representation of the
data as a tensor. All that we require is that the data can be considered as an
element of an associative, commutative algebra with an inner product. Such an
algebra is isomorphic to a commutative sub-algebra of the usual matrix algebra,
allowing the use of matrix algorithms to accomplish the mentioned tasks. We
allow the actual computational representation to be a lossy compression, and we
allow the algebra operations to be performed in an approximate fashion, so as
to maintain a high compression level. One such example which we address
explicitly is the representation of data as a tensor with compression in the
form of a low-rank representation.

<p><b>Authors: </b>Huib Donkers, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/j/Jansen:Bart_M=_P=.html">Bart M. P. Jansen</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05565">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>For a fixed finite family of graphs $\mathcal{F}$, the
$\mathcal{F}$-Minor-Free Deletion problem takes as input a graph $G$ and an
integer $\ell$ and asks whether there exists a set $X \subseteq V(G)$ of size
at most $\ell$ such that $G-X$ is $\mathcal{F}$-minor-free. For
$\mathcal{F}=\{K_2\}$ and $\mathcal{F}=\{K_3\}$ this encodes Vertex Cover and
Feedback Vertex Set respectively. When parameterized by the feedback vertex
number of $G$ these two problems are known to admit a polynomial kernelization.
Such a polynomial kernelization also exists for any $\mathcal{F}$ containing a
planar graph but no forests. In this paper we show that
$\mathcal{F}$-Minor-Free Deletion parameterized by the feedback vertex number
is MK[2]-hard for $\mathcal{F} = \{P_3\}$. This rules out the existence of a
polynomial kernel assuming $NP \subseteq coNP/poly$, and also gives evidence
that the problem does not admit a polynomial Turing kernel. Our hardness result
generalizes to any $\mathcal{F}$ not containing a $P_3$-subgraph-free graph,
using as parameter the vertex-deletion distance to treewidth
$mintw(\mathcal{F})$, where $mintw(\mathcal{F})$ denotes the minimum treewidth
of the graphs in $\mathcal{F}$. For the other case, where $\mathcal{F}$
contains a $P_3$-subgraph-free graph, we present a polynomial Turing
kernelization. Our results extend to $\mathcal{F}$-Subgraph-Free Deletion.

queries introduced by~Ayad et al. (SPIRE 2018, arXiv 2018). We consider a
generalized and unified on-line setting, where we are given a set $X$ of $k$
strings of total length $n$ that can be pre-processed so that, given a query
string $y$ and a positive integer $k'\leq k$, we can determine the longest
substring of $y$ that satisfies some specific property and is common to at
least $k'$ strings in $X$. Ayad et al. considered the longest square-free
substring in an on-line setting and the longest periodic and palindromic
substring in an off-line setting. In this paper, we give efficient solutions in
the on-line setting for finding the longest common square, periodic,
palindromic, and Lyndon substrings. More precisely, we show that $X$ can be
pre-processed in $O(n)$ time resulting in a data structure of $O(n)$ size that
answers queries in $O(|y|\log\sigma)$ time and $O(1)$ working space, where
$\sigma$ is the size of the alphabet, and the common substring must be a
square, a periodic substring, a palindrome, or a Lyndon word.

complexity of graph deletion problems: ${\cal F}$-Subgraph Deletion, ${\cal
F}$-Minor Deletion and Cluster Vertex Deletion in the four most well-studied
streaming models: the EA (edge arrival), DEA (dynamic edge arrival), VA (vertex
arrival) and AL (adjacency list) models. We also consider the streaming
complexities of a collection of widely-studied problems that are special
variants of ${\cal F}$-Subgraph Deletion, namely Feedback Vertex Set, Even
Cycle Transversal, Odd Cycle Transversal, Triangle Deletion, and Cluster Vertex
Deletion.
</p>
<p>Except for the Triangle Deletion and Cluster Vertex Deletion problems, we
show that none of the other problems have space-efficient streaming algorithms
when the problems are parameterized by $k$, the solution size. In fact, we show
that these problems admit $\Omega(n\log n)$ lower bounds in all the four models
stated above. This improves the lower bounds given by Chitnis et al. (SODA'16)
for the EA model. For the Triangle Deletion and Cluster Vertex Deletion
problems, the question of lower bounds for the problems parameterized by $k$ is
open for the AL model. For all other models, we show an improved lower bound of
$\Omega(n\log n)$ for Triangle Deletion. With regards to Cluster Vertex
Deletion, we extend the results of Chitnis et al. (SODA'16) in the EA model to
the DEA and VA models.
</p>
<p>We exploit the power of parameterization - a usual approach taken in
parameterized algorithms - to study a problem with respect to parameters
greater than the solution size or consider some structural parameters.
Parameterized by vertex cover size $K$, some of these problems on some of the
graph streaming models do not admit space-efficient streaming algorithms, while
it does so for others

the computational complexity of these problems. Established lower bounds can be
divided into the following groups: NP-hardness of the above guarantee
parameterization, kernelization lower bounds (answering questions of Misra and
Reddy '18), exponential lower bounds under the Set Cover Conjecture and the
Exponential Time Hypothesis, and inapproximability results. Moreover, we
present an $\mathcal{O}^*(\ell^k)$ randomized algorithm for MHV and an
$\mathcal{O}^*(2^k)$ algorithm for MHE, where $\ell$ is the number of colors

phenomenon which can occur either at the genome or at the DNA level. A tandem
duplication takes a copy of a genome segment and inserts it right after the
segment - this can be represented as the string operation $AXB \Rightarrow
AXXB$. For example, Tandem exon duplications have been found in many species
such as human, fly or worm, and have been largely studied in computational
biology. The Tandem Duplication (TD) distance problem we investigate in this
paper is defined as follows: given two strings $S$ and $T$ over the same
alphabet, compute the smallest sequence of tandem duplications required to
convert $S$ to $T$. The natural question of whether the TD distance can be
computed in polynomial time was posed in 2004 by Leupold et al. and had
remained open, despite the fact that tandem duplications have received much
attention ever since. In this paper, we prove that this problem is NP-hard. We
further show that this hardness holds even if all characters of $S$ are
distinct. This is known as the exemplar TD distance, which is of special
relevance in bioinformatics. One of the tools we develop for the reduction is a
new problem called the Cost-Effective Subgraph, for which we obtain
W[1]-hardness results that might be of independent interest. We finally show
that computing the exemplar TD distance between $S$ and $T$ is fixed-parameter
tractable. Our results open the door to many other questions, and we conclude
with several open problems.

items with the correct order out of $n$ items using pairwise comparisons. In
many applications, multiple rounds of interaction can be costly. We restrict
our attention to algorithms with a constant number of rounds $r$ and try to
minimize the sample complexity, i.e. the number of comparisons.
</p>
<p>When the comparisons are noiseless, we characterize how the optimal sample
complexity depends on the number of rounds (up to a polylogarithmic factor for
general $r$ and up to a constant factor for $r=1$ or 2). In particular, the
sample complexity is $\Theta(n^2)$ for $r=1$, $\Theta(n\sqrt{k} + n^{4/3})$ for
$r=2$ and $\tilde{\Theta}\left(n^{2/r} k^{(r-1)/r} + n\right)$ for $r \geq 3$.
</p>
<p>We extend our results of sorted top-$k$ to the noisy case where each
comparison is correct with probability $2/3$. When $r=1$ or 2, we show that the
sample complexity gets an extra $\Theta(\log(k))$ factor when we transition
from the noiseless case to the noisy case.
</p>
<p>We also prove new results for top-$k$ and sorting in the noisy case. We
believe our techniques can be generally useful for understanding the trade-off
between round complexities and sample complexities of rank aggregation
problems.

discipline dating back to the 1970s. The declarative nature of graph rewriting
rules comes at a cost. In general, to match the left-hand graph of a fixed rule
within a host graph requires polynomial time. To improve matching performance,
D\"orr proposed to equip rules and host graphs with distinguished root nodes.
This model was implemented by Plump and Bak, but unfortunately, is not
invertible. We address this problem by defining rootedness using a partial
function onto a two-point set rather than pointing graphs with root nodes. We
show a new result that the graph class of trees can be recognised by a rooted
GT system in linear time, given an input graph of bounded degree. Finally, we
define a new notion of confluence modulo garbage and non-garbage critical
pairs, showing it is sufficient to require strong joinability of only the
non-garbage critical pairs to establish confluence modulo garbage.

of nonzero vectors in $\mathbb{R}^t$ to its vertices, such that every hyperedge
contains two vertices whose vectors are orthogonal. The orthogonality dimension
of a hypergraph $H$, denoted by $\overline{\xi}(H)$, is the smallest integer
$t$ for which there exists a $t$-dimensional orthogonal representation of $H$.
In this paper we study computational aspects of the orthogonality dimension of
graphs and hypergraphs. We prove that for every $k \geq 4$, it is
$\mathsf{NP}$-hard (resp. quasi-$\mathsf{NP}$-hard) to distinguish $n$-vertex
$k$-uniform hypergraphs $H$ with $\overline{\xi}(H) \leq 2$ from those
satisfying $\overline{\xi}(H) \geq \Omega(\log^\delta n)$ for some constant
$\delta&gt;0$ (resp. $\overline{\xi}(H) \geq \Omega(\log^{1-o(1)} n)$). For
graphs, we relate the $\mathsf{NP}$-hardness of approximating the orthogonality
dimension to a variant of a long-standing conjecture of Stahl. We also consider
the algorithmic problem in which given a graph $G$ with $\overline{\xi}(G) \leq
3$ the goal is to find an orthogonal representation of $G$ of as low dimension
as possible, and provide a polynomial time approximation algorithm based on
semidefinite programming.

<p><b>Authors: </b>Jackie Baek, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Ma:Will.html">Will Ma</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04899">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>We consider prophet inequalities in a setting where agents correspond to both
elements in a matroid and vertices in a graph. A set of agents is feasible if
they form both an independent set in the matroid and an independent set in the
graph. Our main result is an ex-ante 1/(2d+2)-prophet inequality, where d is a
graph parameter upper-bounded by the maximum size of an independent set in the
neighborhood of any vertex.
</p>
<p>We establish this result through a framework that sets both dynamic prices
for elements in the matroid (using the method of balanced thresholds), and
static but discriminatory prices for vertices in the graph (motivated by recent
developments in approximate dynamic programming). The threshold for accepting
an agent is then the sum of these two prices.
</p>
<p>We show that for graphs induced by a certain family of interval-scheduling
constraints, the value of d is 1. Our framework thus provides the first
constant-factor prophet inequality when there are both matroid-independence
constraints and interval-scheduling constraints. It also unifies and improves
several results from the literature, leading to a 1/2-prophet inequality when
agents have XOS valuation functions over a set of items and use them for a
finite interval duration, and more generally, a 1/(d+1)-prophet inequality when
these items each require a bundle of d resources to procure.

that are required to sort all elements of a permutation. A block-interchange
operation exchanges two blocks of a permutation which are not necessarily
adjacent and in a prefix block-interchange, one block is always the prefix of
that permutation. In this paper, we focus on applying prefix block-interchanges
on binary and ternary strings. We present upper bounds to group and sort a
given binary/ternary string. We also provide upper bounds for a different
version of the block-interchange operation which we refer to as the `restricted
prefix block-interchange'. We observe that our obtained upper bound for
restricted prefix block-interchange operations on binary strings is better than
that of other genome rearrangement operations to group fully normalized binary
strings. Consequently, we provide a linear-time algorithm to solve the problem
of grouping binary normalized strings by restricted prefix block-interchanges.
We also provide a polynomial time algorithm to group normalized ternary strings
by prefix block-interchange operations. Finally, we provide a classification
for ternary strings based on the required number of prefix block-interchange
operations.

It shows that low discrepancy classes admit small offline and streaming
coresets. We provide general techniques for bounding the class discrepancy of
machine learning problems. As corollaries of the general technique we bound the
discrepancy (and therefore coreset complexity) of logistic regression, sigmoid
activation loss, matrix covariance, kernel density and any analytic function of
the dot product or the squared distance. Our results prove the existence of
epsilon-approximation O(sqrt{d}/epsilon) sized coresets for the above problems.
This resolves the long-standing open problem regarding the coreset complexity
of Gaussian kernel density estimation. We provide two more related but
independent results. First, an exponential improvement of the widely used
merge-and-reduce trick which gives improved streaming sketches for any low
discrepancy problem. Second, an extremely simple deterministic algorithm for
finding low discrepancy sequences (and therefore coresets) for any positive
semi-definite kernel. This paper establishes some explicit connections between
class discrepancy, coreset complexity, learnability, and streaming algorithms.

that we call stream graphs. It emphasizes the streaming nature of data and
allows rigorous definitions of many important concepts generalizing classical
graphs. This includes in particular size, density, clique, neighborhood,
degree, clustering coefficient, and transitivity. In this contribution, we show
that, like graphs, stream graphs may be extended to cope with bipartite
structures, with node and link weights, or with link directions. We review the
main bipartite, weighted or directed graph concepts proposed in the literature,
we generalize them to the cases of bipartite, weighted, or directed stream
graphs, and we show that obtained concepts are consistent with graph and stream
graph ones. This provides a formal ground for an accurate modeling of the many
temporal networks that have one or several of these features.

network and a transfer graph representing a secondary transportation mode
(e.g., walking or taxis). The objective is to compute all journeys that are
Pareto-optimal with respect to arrival time and the number of required
transfers. While various existing algorithms can efficiently compute optimal
journeys in either a pure public transit network or a pure transfer graph,
combining the two increases running times significantly. As a result, even
walking between stops is typically limited by a maximal duration or distance,
or by requiring the transfer graph to be transitively closed. To overcome these
shortcomings, we propose a novel preprocessing technique called ULTRA
(UnLimited TRAnsfers): Given a complete transfer graph (without any
limitations, representing an arbitrary non-schedule-based mode of
transportation), we compute a small number of transfer shortcuts that are
provably sufficient for computing all Pareto-optimal journeys. We demonstrate
the practicality of our approach by showing that these transfer shortcuts can
be integrated into a variety of state-of-the-art public transit algorithms,
establishing the ULTRA-Query algorithm family. Our extensive experimental
evaluation shows that ULTRA is able to improve these algorithms from limited to
unlimited transfers without sacrificing query speed, yielding the fastest known
algorithms for multi-modal routing. This is true not just for walking, but also
for other transfer modes such as cycling or driving.

Today I want to highlight one of the ideas he presents in his <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783764363505">book</a>.</p>
<p>
The theory is sometimes called stabilization methods. Or K-theory methods. It is often used in connection with the famous Jacobian conjecture (JC). I will not say any more about JC now—see <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/01/29/progress-on-the-jacobian-conjecture/">this</a> for some comments we made a while ago. </p>

The whole method is based on a simple observation. Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%3A+%5Cmathbb%7BK%7D%5E%7Bn%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BK%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F: \mathbb{K}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{K}^{n}}" class="latex" title="{F: \mathbb{K}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{K}^{n}}" /> and define <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" /> by 	</p>

<p>Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> is injective if and only if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" /> is injective. This is trivial—really trivial. From trivial observations sometimes important methods are created. </p>
<p>
I will now explain how why this is useful by presenting an example. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Method: By Example </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Suppose that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++F%3A+%5Cmathbb%7BK%7D%5E%7B2%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BK%7D%5E%7B2%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  F: \mathbb{K}^{2} \rightarrow \mathbb{K}^{2} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  F: \mathbb{K}^{2} \rightarrow \mathbb{K}^{2} " /></p>
<p>is a polynomial mapping where 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++F%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+%28f%28x%2Cy%29%2Cg%28x%2Cy%29%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  F(x,y) = (f(x,y),g(x,y)). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  F(x,y) = (f(x,y),g(x,y)). " /></p>
<p>We wish to show that we can replace <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> by another polynomial map <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctilde+F%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\tilde F}" class="latex" title="{\tilde F}" /> that has degree at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{3}" class="latex" title="{3}" />. Moreover, the new polynomial map is injective if and only if the original polynomial map is injective. The method can be used to preserve other properties of the polynomial mapping, but being injective is a important example. </p>
<p>
There seems to be no way to lower the degree of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> without destroying its structure. But if we use the stability philosophy and allow extra dimensions we can succeed. That is we replace <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F(x,y)}" class="latex" title="{F(x,y)}" /> by the function 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Ctilde%7BF%7D%28x%2Cy%2Cu%2Cv%29+%3D+%28f%28x%2Cy%29%2Cg%28x%2Cy%29%2Cu%2Cv%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \tilde{F}(x,y,u,v) = (f(x,y),g(x,y),u,v). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \tilde{F}(x,y,u,v) = (f(x,y),g(x,y),u,v). " /></p>
<p>Why does this work? The idea is that the extra two dimensions can be used as extra <i>registers</i>. These registers can be used to simplify the computation, and reduce the degree of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" />. </p>
<p>
Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f(x,y)}" class="latex" title="{f(x,y)}" /> have one term that we wish to remove. To be concrete, let’s assume the term is 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x%5E%7B3%7Dy.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  x^{3}y. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  x^{3}y. " /></p>
<p>Start with the input 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28x%2Cy%2Cu%2Cv%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  (x,y,u,v). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  (x,y,u,v). " /></p>
<p>Now change this to 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28x%2Cy%2Cu%2BP%2Cv%2BQ%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  (x,y,u+P,v+Q), " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  (x,y,u+P,v+Q), " /></p>
<p>where 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++P%3Dx%5E%7B2%7D+%5Ctext%7B+and+%7D+Q%3Dxy.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  P=x^{2} \text{ and } Q=xy. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  P=x^{2} \text{ and } Q=xy. " /></p>
<p>This is an invertible transformation. Note this is only possible because we have two extra dimensions or registers. Otherwise, we could not compute <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Q}" class="latex" title="{Q}" /> without messing up the rest of the computation. Now map this to 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28f%28x%2Cy%29%2Cg%28x%2Cy%29%2Cu%2BP%2Cv%2BQ%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  (f(x,y),g(x,y),u+P,v+Q). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  (f(x,y),g(x,y),u+P,v+Q). " /></p>
<p>This is nothing more than computing the original function and ignoring the new registers. </p>
<p>
The next step is to go to 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28f-%28u%2BP%29%28v%2BQ%29%2Cg%2Cu%2BPv%2BQ%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  (f-(u+P)(v+Q),g,u+Pv+Q). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  (f-(u+P)(v+Q),g,u+Pv+Q). " /></p>
<p>The last point is that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f-+%28u%2BP%29%28v%2BQ%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  f- (u+P)(v+Q), " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  f- (u+P)(v+Q), " /></p>
<p>cancels the term <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5E%7B3%7Dy%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x^{3}y}" class="latex" title="{x^{3}y}" /> we wished to remove. 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f-+PQ+-uQ+-vP-uv+%3D+f-x%5E%7B2%7Dxy+-uxy+-+vx%5E%7B2%7D-uv.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  f- PQ -uQ -vP-uv = f-x^{2}xy -uxy - vx^{2}-uv. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  f- PQ -uQ -vP-uv = f-x^{2}xy -uxy - vx^{2}-uv. " /></p>
<p>The price we pay is that new terms have been added, but they have at most degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{3}" class="latex" title="{3}" />. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Method: General Case </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We can prove by induction the following general theorem: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> Suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%3A+%5Cmathbb%7BK%7D%5E%7Bn%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BK%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F: \mathbb{K}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{K}^{n}}" class="latex" title="{F: \mathbb{K}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{K}^{n}}" /> is polynomial map where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{K}" class="latex" title="{K}" /> is a field. Then we can construct a polynomial map of degree at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{3}" class="latex" title="{3}" /> denoted by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctilde+F%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\tilde F}" class="latex" title="{\tilde F}" /> so that it is injective precisely when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> is injective. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Even stronger theorems are possible. For example, the polynomial map <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctilde+F%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\tilde F}" class="latex" title="{\tilde F}" /> can be required to be cubic linear: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Definition 2</b> <em> Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> is in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Ctimes+n%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n \times n}" class="latex" title="{n \times n}" /> matrix over the field <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BK%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathbb{K}}" class="latex" title="{\mathbb{K}}" />. The <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF_%7BA%7D%28X%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F_{A}(X)}" class="latex" title="{F_{A}(X)}" /> is the <b>cubic linear</b> map for the matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> is defined to be the map <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF_%7BA%7D%3A+%5Cmathbb%7BK%7D%5E%7Bn%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BK%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F_{A}: \mathbb{K}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{K}^{n}}" class="latex" title="{F_{A}: \mathbb{K}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{K}^{n}}" /> 	</em></p><em>

</em><p><em>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%5E%7B%2A3%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y^{*3}}" class="latex" title="{Y^{*3}}" /> is defined to be the vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" /> so that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ_%7Bk%7D+%3D+Y_%7Bk%7D%5E%7B3%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z_{k} = Y_{k}^{3}}" class="latex" title="{Z_{k} = Y_{k}^{3}}" /> for all coordinates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k}" class="latex" title="{k}" />. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
See Essen’s book for more details. Note a cubic linear map when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3D2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n=2}" class="latex" title="{n=2}" /> is of the form: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28+x+%2B+%28+ax+%2B+by%29%5E%7B3%7D%2C+y+%2B+%28cx+%2B+dy%29%5E%7B3%7D+%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  ( x + ( ax + by)^{3}, y + (cx + dy)^{3} ) " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  ( x + ( ax + by)^{3}, y + (cx + dy)^{3} ) " /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%2Cb%2Cc%2Cd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a,b,c,d}" class="latex" title="{a,b,c,d}" /> are constants. This reduction to cubic linear maps is quite pretty, and requires a clever application of the stabilization method.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> A Limit of The Method </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The reduction in degree is possible only to degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{3}" class="latex" title="{3}" />. It cannot be reduced to degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" /> in general. Let’s look at the intuition why this is true. The last step is 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f-+%28u%2BP%29%28v%2BQ%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  f- (u+P)(v+Q) " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  f- (u+P)(v+Q) " /></p>
<p>which is 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f-+PQ+-uQ+-vP.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  f- PQ -uQ -vP. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  f- PQ -uQ -vP. " /></p>
<p>Suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f}" class="latex" title="{f}" /> has a leading term of degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" />. Also suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> has degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd_%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d_{P}}" class="latex" title="{d_{P}}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Q}" class="latex" title="{Q}" /> has degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd_%7BQ%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d_{Q}}" class="latex" title="{d_{Q}}" />. Then 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++d+%3D+d_%7BP%7D+%2B+d_%7BQ%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  d = d_{P} + d_{Q} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  d = d_{P} + d_{Q} " /></p>
<p>since the leading term goes away. But <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BuQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{uQ}" class="latex" title="{uQ}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BvP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{vP}" class="latex" title="{vP}" /> have degrees <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd_%7BP%7D%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d_{P}+1}" class="latex" title="{d_{P}+1}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd_%7BQ%7D%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d_{Q}+1}" class="latex" title="{d_{Q}+1}" /> respectively. So to keep <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd_%7BP%7D%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d_{P}+1}" class="latex" title="{d_{P}+1}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd_%7BQ%7D%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d_{Q}+1}" class="latex" title="{d_{Q}+1}" /> both <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" /> or less, it follows that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" /> can be at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" />. However, in this case a term of degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" /> is removed and other terms of degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" /> are added. This is not a formal proof that the method cannot reduce the degree to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" />. I do believe that formalized properly it is a theorem that reduction to degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" /> is in general impossible. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I like this technology. I wonder if it might be possible to use it on some of our favorite problems. I do like that it conserves invertibility. This seems like it could be related to quantum computing, because of the reversible nature of quantum computing. </p>

This week finds me in Moscow for a pair of workshops, the <a href="https://mipt.ru/education/chairs/dm/conferences/workshop-june-9-11-moscow-2019.php">Russian Workshop on Complexity and Model Theory</a> and a workshop on <a href="https://www.poncelet.ru/conference/ric">Randomness, Information and Complexity</a>. The latter celebrates the lives of Alexander Shen and Nikolay Vereshchagin on their 60th birthdays.<br />
<br />
Alexander Shen might be best known in computational complexity for his <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/146585.146613">alternate proof</a> of IP = PSPACE. In 1989, Lund, Fortnow, Karloff and Nisan gave an interactive proof for the permanent, which got the entire polynomial-time hierarchy by Toda's theorem. But we didn't know how to push the protocol to PSPACE, we had a problem keeping degrees of polynomials low. Shamir had the first proof by looking at a specific protocol for PSPACE. Shen had the brilliant but simple idea to use a degree reducing operator, taking the polynomial modulo x<sup>2</sup>-x. The three papers appeared <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=146585#prox">back-to-back-to-back</a> in JACM.<br />
<br />
Shen and Vereshchagin though made their careers with their extensive work on Kolmogorov complexity and entropy, often together. Vereshchagin and I have co-authored some papers together during our mutual trips to Amsterdam, including on <a href="http://doi.org/10.1007/11672142_10">Kolmogorov Complexity with Errors</a> and how to <a href="http://doi.org/10.1007/b106485">increase Kolmogorov Complexity</a>. My <a href="https://doi.org/10.1006/jcss.1999.1677">favorite work</a> of Shen and Vereshchagin, which they did with Daniel Hammer and Andrei Romashchenko showed that every linear inequality that holds for entropy also holds for Kolmogorov complexity and vice-versa, the best argument that the two notions of information, one based on distributions, the other based on strings, share strong connections.<br />
<br />
Today is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_Day">Russia Day</a> that celebrates the reestablishment of Russia out of the Soviet Union in 1990. Just like how the British celebrate their succession from the US in 1776 I guess. But I'm celebrating Russia day by honoring these two great Russians. Congrats Sasha and Kolya!</div>

<p>Several of my past papers concern Lombardi drawing, which I and my coauthors named after conspiracy-theory artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lombardi">Mark Lombardi</a>. In this style of drawing, edges are drawn as circular arcs, and must meet at equal angles around every vertex. Not every graph has such a drawing, but many symmetrical graphs do (example below: the smallest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-symmetric_graph">zero-symmetric graph</a> with only two edge orbits).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/Two-edge-orbit_GRR.svg" alt="The smallest zero-symmetric graph with only two edge orbits" /></p>

<p>All 2-degenerate graphs do as well; these are the graphs that can be reduced to nothing by removing vertices of degree at most two. And all 3-regular planar graphs have planar drawings in this style; I drew the one below to illustrate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinberg%27s_theorem">Grinberg’s theorem</a>, a necessary condition for Hamiltonicity of planar graphs.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/Grinberg_5CEC_Nonhamiltonian_graph.svg" alt="Grinberg's non-Hamiltonian planar cubic graph with cyclic edge-connectivity five" /></p>

<p>So anyway, my newest arXiv preprint is “Bipartite and series-parallel graphs without planar Lombardi drawings” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04401">arXiv:1906.04401</a>, to appear at <a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~cccg2019/">CCCG</a>). It is about some families of planar graphs that have Lombardi drawings (because they are 2-degenerate) but do not have planar Lombardi drawings. They include planar bipartite graphs like the one below (but with more edges and vertices):</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/nested-K2n.svg" alt="Construction for a family of planar bipartite graphs with no planar Lombardi drawing " /></p>

<p>and embedded series-parallel graphs like the one below (again, with more edges and vertices):</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/nonlom-serpar.svg" alt="Construction for a family of embedded series-parallel graphs with no planar Lombardi drawing" /></p>

<p>The key structures that makes both of these graphs hard to draw in Lombardi style are their yellow-blue quadrilateral faces.
The red parts of the graph are just filler to make these faces have the right angles. The yellow-blue quadrilaterals all share the same two yellow vertices,
and I like to think of them as forming a ring dancing hand-to-hand around these two yellow vertices like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_(Matisse)">Matisse’s dancers</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/Matisse-Dance.jpg" alt="_La Danse_, Henri Matisse, 1910, from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Matissedance.jpg" /></p>

<p>When I wrote about <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2018/12/22/circles-crossing-equal.html">quadrilaterals with circular-arc edges meeting at equal angles at each vertex</a> last December, it was these rings of quadrilaterals I was thinking about. As I wrote in my previous post, each of these quadrilaterals has a circumscribing circle. It’s not hard to make one arc polygon with four equal angles, as sharp as you like. But when the angles get sharp and two of these polygons share two opposite vertices and are packed at a tight angle next to each other (as all the yellow-blue quadrilateral faces in these graphs do) each of the two adjacent quadrilaterals must have a deep pocket into which its neighbor reaches to touch its circumcircle, and this forces them to become quite distorted looking.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/reacharound.svg" alt="Two sharp circular-arc quadrilaterals reach into each others' pockets to touch their circumscribing circles" /></p>

<p>If we think of these two quadrilaterals as dancers, with their heads and toes at the shared points and with their hands free, then both of them have their right hands (from the perspective of the viewer) held high and their left hands held low. Extending the same picture to a complete ring of dancers, each dancer in the ring must be holding their right hand higher than their neighbor to the left. But this obviously can’t extend all the way around the ring, because when you came back to the dancer you started with their hand should be the same height as it was when you started.</p>

<p>This is all very metaphorical but fortunately this intuition can be turned into a mathematical proof that the drawing doesn’t exist. The correct tools for measuring the heights of the quadrilateral vertices turn out to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation">Möbius transformations</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_coordinates">bipolar coordinates</a>, a system for assigning coordinates to points in the plane by the angle they make with two fixed points (the two yellow shared vertices of all the quadrilateral faces of our graph) and the ratio of their distances to the fixed points.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/apollo.svg" alt="Level sets for bipolar coordinates" /></p>

<p>Möbius transformations preserve the circular-arc shape of our quadrilateral sides, and the angles at which they meet. When we restrict them to the transformations that leave the two poles of the bipolar coordinate system fixed, they act very nicely on the two coordinates, essentially adding fixed amounts to each coordinate. We can use them to transform our quadrilaterals into a more canonical shape and prove that the radius-ratio coordinate increases from one quadrilateral to the next around our ring of quadrilaterals, getting the same contradiction described above and proving that no drawing exists.</p>

<p>The most obvious questions in the same direction that this paper leaves unsolved are: what about series-parallel graphs where you do not have a fixed planar embedding for the graph? And what about outerplanar graphs (either with the outerplanar embedding or without fixing an embedding)? We neither have a method for finding planar Lombardi drawings of all graphs of these types, nor a proof that these drawings do not exist.</p>

In this note we compare two measures of the complexity of a class $\mathcal F$ of Boolean functions studied in (unconditional) pseudorandomness: $\mathcal F$'s ability to distinguish between biased and uniform coins (the coin problem), and the norms of the different levels of the Fourier expansion of functions in $\mathcal F$ (the Fourier growth). We show that for coins with low bias $\varepsilon = o(1/n)$, a function's distinguishing advantage in the coin problem is essentially equivalent to $\varepsilon$ times the sum of its level $1$ Fourier coefficients, which in particular shows that known level $1$ and total influence bounds for some classes of interest (such as constant-width read-once branching programs) in fact follow as a black-box from the corresponding coin theorems, thereby simplifying the proofs of some known results in the literature. For higher levels, it is well-known that Fourier growth bounds on all levels of the Fourier spectrum imply coin theorems, even for large $\varepsilon$, and we discuss here the possibility of a converse.</div>

<p>
Gustav Kirchhoff was a German physicist active in the mid-1800s. He is known for many things, especially for his “Laws” governing voltage and current in electrical circuits. Today we ask whether anything akin to Kirchhoff’s laws can be formulated for quantum circuits.

</p><p>
What may be less known about Kirchhoff is that he was a pioneer in graph theory. He proved Kirchhoff’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff's_theorem">Theorem</a> that the number of spanning trees equals the determinant of an associated matrix. This shows that the trees can be counted in polynomial time—a cool result. Here we present a class of graphs arising from quantum circuits and associated operations more complex than determinants.

</p><p>
Our search for new graph-based laws was driven by our work on simulations of stabilizer circuits. We have discussed this recently <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/04/a-quantum-connection-for-matrix-rank/">here</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/07/a-rank-problem/">here</a>. The bottom line is this:

</p><p>

</p><blockquote><b> </b> <em> <i>A new class of graphs arises in a natural way and holds a key to improving certain quantum simulations.</i> </em>
</blockquote>


<p>



</p><p>
We call these <i>net-zero graphs</i>. We like to imagine that Kirchhoff would have been interested. We will say more about why after we present the graphs.<span id="more-15977"></span>



</p><p>


</p><p>



</p><p>

</p><h2> Net-Zero Graphs </h2>


<p>



</p><p>
The new class of graphs comes from a natural counting problem. Consider black/white two colorings (not necessarily proper) of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> vertices of a graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" />, and count the number of edges whose two nodes are both colored black, being called B-B edges. Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{c_0}" class="latex" title="{c_0}" /> be the count of colorings that make an even number of B-B edges and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc_1+%3D+2%5En+-+c_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{c_1 = 2^n - c_0}" class="latex" title="{c_1 = 2^n - c_0}" /> be the count of colorings that make an odd number of B-B edges. Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%28G%29+%3D+c_0+-+c_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a(G) = c_0 - c_1}" class="latex" title="{a(G) = c_0 - c_1}" /> divided by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^n}" class="latex" title="{2^n}" />. Now we are good to define “Net-Zero” graphs as follows:

</p><p>

</p><blockquote><b> </b> <em> An undirected graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" /> is net-zero if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%28G%29+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a(G) = 0}" class="latex" title="{a(G) = 0}" />. </em>
</blockquote>


<p>



</p><p>
Furthermore, we can call <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" /> <em>net-positive</em> if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a &gt; 0}" class="latex" title="{a &gt; 0}" /> and <em>net-negative</em> if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%3C+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a &lt; 0}" class="latex" title="{a &lt; 0}" />. By simple trial and error, the smallest net-zero graph is the triangle graph and the graph made by two triangles sharing an edge is net-zero as well. Here are some connected net-zero graphs of small size:

</p><p>



</p><p>
You might ask why study such labelings of graphs? Why is net-zero an interesting property? An equivalent formulation of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%28G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a(G)}" class="latex" title="{a(G)}" /> was given as “<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ_%7BH_2%7D%28G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z_{H_2}(G)}" class="latex" title="{Z_{H_2}(G)}" />” (divided by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^n}" class="latex" title="{2^n}" />) in a 2009 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0804.1932">paper</a> by Leslie Goldberg, Martin Grohe, Mark Jerrum, and Marc Thurley, as part of a larger enumeration of polynomial-time cases. Their proof works by reduction to the problem of counting solutions to quadratic polynomials modulo 2, whose time we just <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/04/a-quantum-connection-for-matrix-rank/">improved</a> from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E3%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^3)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^3)}" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E%5Comega%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^\omega)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^\omega)}" />. Their paper does not mention quantum but does involve Hadamard-type matrices. Thus the short answer is that net-zero captures a type of balancing property that is related to understanding quantum circuits.

</p><h2> Some Examples and Facts </h2>


<p>



</p><p>
The following elementary facts show how the theory of our graphs takes shape.

</p><p>

</p><blockquote><b>Proposition 1</b> <em> Every cycle graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_n%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C_n}" class="latex" title="{C_n}" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> odd is net-zero. </em>
</blockquote>


<p>



</p><p>
This follows because every coloring of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C_n}" class="latex" title="{C_n}" /> has an even number of B-W edges. Hence the number of monochrome edges is odd, and so complementing the coloring flips the parity between B-B and W-W edges. However, having an odd cycle as an induced graph does not make a graph net-zero. An example of this would be a 4-clique graph. Any subset of vertices of size 3 gives an triangle which is net-zero, but the 4-clique itself is net-negative.

</p><p>

</p><blockquote><b>Proposition 2</b> <em> A graph is net-zero if and only if one of its connected components is net-zero. </em>
</blockquote>


<p>



</p><p>
This fact is intuitive when we look at the graph as a tensor product over the connected components, so the colorings to each component are independent. Every coloring <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R}" class="latex" title="{R}" /> on nodes outside the net-zero connected component can be easily extended to one coloring <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R'}" class="latex" title="{R'}" /> for the entire graph by coloring nodes on the net-zero component, so the difference <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a}" class="latex" title="{a}" /> restricted by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R}" class="latex" title="{R}" /> is zero.

</p><p>
Now let’s deviate from net-zero graphs. What are some typical net-positive graphs?

</p><p>

</p><blockquote><b>Proposition 3</b> <em> Bipartite graphs are net-positive. </em>
</blockquote>


<p>



</p><p>
To prove this, let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV_1%2C+V_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{V_1, V_2}" class="latex" title="{V_1, V_2}" /> be the two disjoint vertex sets such that each edge connects one node from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{V_1}" class="latex" title="{V_1}" /> and one from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{V_2}" class="latex" title="{V_2}" />. If all nodes in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{V_1}" class="latex" title="{V_1}" /> are set to be white, then there will be zero B-B edges regardless of how <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{V_2}" class="latex" title="{V_2}" /> is acolored, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a &gt; 0}" class="latex" title="{a &gt; 0}" /> in this case. Now if any of the nodes, say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{u}" class="latex" title="{u}" />, in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{V_1}" class="latex" title="{V_1}" /> is colored black, then the number of B-B blacks equals the number of nodes connected to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{u}" class="latex" title="{u}" /> that are colored black, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a = 0}" class="latex" title="{a = 0}" /> in this situation by straightforward combination calculation. Hence bipartite graphs are net-positive. 

</p><p>
As a consequence, since all trees are bipartite, all trees are net-positive. So is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C_n}" class="latex" title="{C_n}" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> even. Net-negative graphs may seem to be rarer. We invite readers to work out from Pascal’s triangle when the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k}" class="latex" title="{k}" />-clique is net-negative, net-zero, and net-positive. Congruence modulo <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B8%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{8}" class="latex" title="{8}" /> is involved.

</p><p>
Other interesting examples come from allowing self-loops. The smallest net-zero graph of this kind is a single self-loop. But a 2-node graph with an edge connecting them and two self-loops is net-negative, and so is a graph of two triangles connected by one edge. Pictorially, these two graphs are: 



</p><p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/10/net-zero-graphs/localequiv/" rel="attachment wp-att-15982"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/localequiv.png?w=136&amp;h=120" alt="" width="136" class="aligncenter wp-image-15982" height="120" /></a>

</p><p>
There is a “local equivalence” between a single self-loop and a triangle: Any self-loop in a graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" /> can be replaced by a triangle using two new vertices, and the resulting graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G'}" class="latex" title="{G'}" /> will be net-zero if and only if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" /> is.

</p><h2> The Quantum Connection </h2>


<p>

There is a special class of quantum circuits that relate closely to graphs. They use just two kinds of quantum gates: Hadamard gate and the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BCZ%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{CZ}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{CZ}}" /> gate.

These circuits are a subset of <em>stabilizer circuits</em>, which we <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/04/a-quantum-connection-for-matrix-rank/">have</a> been <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/07/a-rank-problem/">discussing</a>. They become equivalent to stabilizer circuits if we also allow so-called phase gates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BS%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{S}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{S}}" /> on single qubits, where they are analogous to a loop or “half-loop” at the corresponding vertex. We will stay with the simpler circuits here. The connection to graphs is expressed by:

</p><blockquote><b>Theorem 5</b> <em><a name="amplitude"></a> For any graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%28G%29+%3D+%5Clangle+0%5En+%7C+C_G+%7C+0%5En%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a(G) = \langle 0^n | C_G | 0^n\rangle}" class="latex" title="{a(G) = \langle 0^n | C_G | 0^n\rangle}" />, that is, the amplitude of measuring an all-zero output given an all-zero input.

</p><h2> Recognizing Net-Zero Graphs </h2>


<p>



</p><p>
Theorem <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#amplitude">5</a> implies that whether a graph is net-zero can be decided in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E%5Comega%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^\omega)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^\omega)}" /> time. The question is, can we improve the time to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^2)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^2)}" />, which for dense graphs means linear in the number of edges? The reason why we want to do so is the following further theorem:

</p><p>


</p><p>

</p><blockquote><b>Theorem 6</b> <em> If net-zero graphs of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> nodes with self-loops allowed are recognizable in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^2)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^2)}" /> time, then computing the strong simulation probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%5Clangle+0%5En+%7C+C+%7C+0%5En%5Crangle%7C%5E2%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{|\langle 0^n | C | 0^n\rangle|^2}" class="latex" title="{|\langle 0^n | C | 0^n\rangle|^2}" /> for quantum stabilizer circuits <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C}" class="latex" title="{C}" /> is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^2)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^2)}" />-time equivalent to computing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Ctimes+n%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n \times n}" class="latex" title="{n \times n}" /> matrix rank over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D_2%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathbb{Z}_2}" class="latex" title="{\mathbb{Z}_2}" />. </em>
</blockquote>


<p>



</p><p>
This is proved in section 5 of our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00101">paper</a>, which has a duality technique for eliminating the self-loops from phase gates that works for the probability but possibly not for the amplitude. Another way of stating our theorem is:

</p><p>

</p><blockquote><b>Theorem 7</b> <em> Given any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />-vertex graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" />, we can compute <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%28G%29+%3D+a%28G%29%5E2%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p(G) = a(G)^2}" class="latex" title="{p(G) = a(G)^2}" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^2)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^2)}" /> time given only the rank of the adjacency matrix of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" /> and the yes/no answer about whether <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%28G%29+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a(G) = 0}" class="latex" title="{a(G) = 0}" />. </em>
</blockquote>


<p>



</p><p>
This result extends to computing the probability of any output of a stabilizer circuit given a standard-basis input. This is why the decision problem for recognizing net-zero graphs is important.

</p><p>
In upcoming posts we will connect net-zero graphs further to ideas of circuit “laws” by defining recursions for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%28G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a(G)}" class="latex" title="{a(G)}" />. These recursions do not give efficient algorithms by themselves, but they connect to a wide theory involving graph polynomials and matroids. That theory includes Kirchhoff’s counting of spanning trees as a special case, and we will be interested in which other cases are polynomial-time feasible. This may position quantum computing as a meeting point for closer connections between work such as this 1997 <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.51.2071">paper</a> by Andrei Broder and Ernst Mayr on counting minimum-weight spanning trees in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E%5Comega%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^\omega)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^\omega)}" /> time and the paper by Goldberg et al. mentioned above.

</p><p>


</p><p>



</p><p>

</p><h2> Open Problems </h2>


<p>



</p><p>
What is the complexity of deciding whether a given <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />-vertex graph is net-zero? We know it is at worst order-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%5Comega%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n^\omega}" class="latex" title="{n^\omega}" />. If it is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^2)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^2)}" />, then we obtain a really tight connection between computing matrix rank and computing a quantum simulation probability.

</p><p>
Are there further applications of net-zero graphs?

<p><br /><br /><br />Specifically, in the previous version of the book I used <em>programming languages </em>as the main computational models. While I still think this is the right way if we were to “start from scratch”, these idiosyncratic models made it harder for students to use other resources such as textbooks and lecture notes. They also make it more difficult for instructors to use individual chapters in their courses without committing to using the full book.</p>



<p>Hence in the new revision the standard models of <strong>Turing Machines</strong> and <strong>Boolean Circuits</strong> are front and center. We do talk about the programming-language equivalents as well, since I think they are important for the connection to practice and some concepts such as the duality of code and data are better explained in these terms.  I also use the programming-language variants to <a href="https://github.com/boazbk/tcscode">demonstrate concepts to students in code</a> including compilers from circuits to straightline programs, various “syntactic sugar” transformations, and the Cook-Levin Theorem and NP reductions. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/aoncircequiv.png?w=600" alt="" class="wp-image-7521" /><em>An equivalent description of a finite computation using straight-line programs and Boolean circuits. The <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/boazbk/tcscode/blob/master/Chap_03_Computation.ipynb">supplementary code</a> contains a Python implementation of the transformation between these two representations.</em></figure>



<p><br /><br />One thing did not change – we still start with <em>Boolean Circuits </em>rather than automata as the initial computational model. Boolean circuits are closer to actual implementations of computing, are a finite (and hence simpler) model, but one that is non-trivial enough to allow showing some important theorems early in the course including existence of a circuit for computing every finite function, the existence of a circuit to evaluate other circuits, and the counting lower bound as well as the counting lower bound. </p>



<p>Circuits are also crucial for later material in the course since they make the proof of the Cook-Levin Theorem much simpler and cleaner,  allow talking about results such as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=BPP+%5Csubseteq+P_%7B%2Fpoly%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="BPP \subseteq P_{/poly}" class="latex" title="BPP \subseteq P_{/poly}" /> and Sipser-Gacs, and are crucial to be even able to state results in advanced topics such as derandomization, cryptography, and quantum computing.</p>

<p><br /><br />We do cover automata as well, including the equivalence of regular expressions and deterministic finite automata. We also cover context-free grammars (though not pushdown automata) and the λ calculus, including its equivalence with Turing Machines and the Y combinator (see also <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/boazbk/tcscode/blob/master/lambda_calculus.ipynb">this notebook</a>)</p>



<p>I have also done some work on the technical side of producing the book. The book is written in markdown. Markdown has many advantages but it wasn’t designed for 600-page technical books full of equations and cross-references so I did need to use some extensions to it. I am using pandoc (and my own <a href="https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/blob/master/scripts/book-filter.py">filter</a>) to produce both the HTML and LaTeX/PDF versions of the book. </p>



<p>There is still more work to do. I plan to add a chapter on space complexity and on proofs and computation (including both interactive and zero knowledge proofs, as well as the “propositions as types” correspondence between proofs and programs). I need to add more examples and exercises. There are also still several chapters where the text is “rough around the edges”.</p>



<p>As usual, the latest version of the book is available on  <a href="https://introtcs.org/">https://introtcs.org</a>  .

<p>In this post I briefly discuss some recent stunning progress on robust bandits (for more background on bandits see these two posts, <a href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2016/05/11/bandit-theory-part-i/" class="liinternal">part 1</a> and <a href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2016/05/13/bandit-theory-part-ii/" class="liinternal">part 2</a>, in particular what is described below gives a solution to Open Problem 3 at the end of part 2).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Stochastic bandit and adversarial examples</strong></p>
<p>In multi-armed bandit problems the gold standard property, going back to <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82425825.pdf" class="lipdf">a seminal paper</a> of Lai and Robbins in 1985 is to have a regret upper bounded by:</p>
<p style="line-height: 50px;" class="ql-center-displayed-equation"><span class="ql-right-eqno"> (1) </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-2ac69fee3f1e4890b09202da232941f6_l3.png?resize=91%2C50&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="50" width="91" alt="\begin{equation*} \sum_{i \neq i^*} \frac{\log(T)}{\Delta_i} \,. \end{equation*}" class="ql-img-displayed-equation " /></p>
<p>Let me unpack this a bit: this is for the scenario where the reward process for each action is simply an i.i.d. sequence from some fixed distribution, <img src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9af0b76a90462b68c1d83fca9cc6604d_l3.png?resize=12%2C13&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="13" width="12" alt="i^*" class="ql-img-inline-formula " /> is the index of the (unique) best action, and <img src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9ca6025283881ee4c29a1f9f236d72ba_l3.png?resize=20%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="15" width="20" alt="\Delta_i" class="ql-img-inline-formula " /> is the gap between the mean value of the best action and the one of <img src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-8511b1f6cf9db17d46ddabb67bac99f5_l3.png?resize=6%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="6" alt="i" class="ql-img-inline-formula " />. Such guarantee is extremely strong, as in particular it means that actions whose average performance is a constant away from the optimal arm are very rarely played (only of order <img src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b7ebb3614adc5ab9694e195d68bdbd06_l3.png?resize=49%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="18" width="49" alt="\log(T)" class="ql-img-inline-formula " />). On the other hand, the price to pay for such an aggressive behavior (by this I mean focusing on good actions very quickly) is that all the classical algorithms attaining the above bound are extremely sensitive to <em>adversarial examples</em>: that is if there is some deviation from the i.i.d. assumption (even very brief in time), the algorithms can suddenly suffer linear in <img src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-58f18d11e5ffdd11dd9095c427922c8b_l3.png?resize=13%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="13" alt="T" class="ql-img-inline-formula " /> regret.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Adversarial bandit</strong></p>
<p>Of course there is an entirely different line of works, on <em>adversarial multi-armed bandits</em>, where the whole point is to prove regret guarantee for <em>any</em> reward process. In this case the best one can hope for is a regret of order <img src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-13ba497e024059e3674272b6a0e11809_l3.png?resize=44%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="18" width="44" alt="\sqrt{K T}" class="ql-img-inline-formula " />. The classical algorithm in this model, Exp3, attains a regret of order <img src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-fc756065e4451f8bccc02a40b732c969_l3.png?resize=103%2C22&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="22" width="103" alt="\sqrt{K T \log(K)}" class="ql-img-inline-formula " />. In joint work with Jean-Yves Audibert we showed <a href="http://sbubeck.com/COLT09_AB.pdf" class="lipdf">back in 2009</a> that the following strategy, which we called PolyINF, attains the optimal <img src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3cf8321c07956bc2bd76714eabd30a0a_l3.png?resize=44%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="18" width="44" alt="\sqrt{KT}" class="ql-img-inline-formula " />: view Exp3 as Mirror Descent with the (negative) entropy as a regularizer, and now replace the entropy by a simple rational function namely <img src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-ac7b6228954b4b6f9ceee99faf3d7776_l3.png?resize=77%2C24&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="24" width="77" alt="- \sum_{i=1}^K x_i^p" class="ql-img-inline-formula " /> with <img src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-de24a5fa6badcd9e8c80a7d72640dcc6_l3.png?resize=70%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="18" width="70" alt="p \in (0,1)" class="ql-img-inline-formula " /> (this mirror descent view was actually derived in <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/moor.2013.0598" class="liinternal">a later paper</a> with Gabor Lugosi). The proof becomes one line (given the appropriate knowledge of mirror descent and estimation in bandit games): the radius part of the bound is of the form <img src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a3d6ffad60b5151ac3866f9fa9213b65_l3.png?resize=120%2C27&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="27" width="120" alt="\frac{1}{\eta} \sum_{i=1}^K x_i^p \leq \frac{K^{p}}{\eta}" class="ql-img-inline-formula " />, while the variance is of the form (since the inverse of the Hessian of the mirror map is a diagonal matrix with entries <img src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-0b3188b0bc4d641381b7ba4be936c230_l3.png?resize=35%2C23&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="23" width="35" alt="x_i^{2-p}" class="ql-img-inline-formula " />):</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Best of both worlds</strong></p>
<p>This was the state of affairs back in 2011, when with Alex Slivkins we started working on a <em>best of both worlds</em> type algorithm (which in today’s language is exactly a stochastic MAB robust to adversarial examples): namely one that gets the <img src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b7ebb3614adc5ab9694e195d68bdbd06_l3.png?resize=49%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="18" width="49" alt="\log(T)" class="ql-img-inline-formula " /> guarantee (in fact <img src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-00cc550d710d51cc64227da3b639018e_l3.png?resize=56%2C20&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="20" width="56" alt="\log^2(T)" class="ql-img-inline-formula " /> in <a href="http://sbubeck.com/COLT12_BS.pdf" class="lipdf">our original paper</a>) if the environment is the nice i.i.d. one, and also <img src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-13ba497e024059e3674272b6a0e11809_l3.png?resize=44%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="18" width="44" alt="\sqrt{K T}" class="ql-img-inline-formula " /> (in fact <img src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-4d85e820be8841c565042231480be3ac_l3.png?resize=107%2C33&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="33" width="107" alt="\sqrt{K T \log^3(T)}" class="ql-img-inline-formula " />) in the worst case. This original best of both worlds algorithm was of the following form: be aggressive as if it was a stochastic environment, but still sample sufficiently often the bad actions to make sure there isn’t an adversary trying to hide some non-stochastic behavior on these seemingly bad performing actions. Of course the whole difficulty was to show that it is possible to implement such a defense without hurting the stochastic performance too much (remember that bad actions can only be sampled of order <img src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b7ebb3614adc5ab9694e195d68bdbd06_l3.png?resize=49%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="18" width="49" alt="\log(T)" class="ql-img-inline-formula " /> times!). Since this COLT 2012 paper there has been many improvements to the original strategy, as well as many variants/refinements (one such variant worth mentioning are the works trying to do a smooth transition between the stochastic and adversarial models, see e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09353" class="liinternal">here</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08647" class="liinternal">here</a>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A stunning twist</strong></p>
<p>The amazing development that I want to talk about in this post is the following: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07623" class="liinternal">about a year ago</a> Julian Zimmert and Yevgeny Seldin proved that the 2009 PolyINF (crucially with <img src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-d9aaa949f328021d5d7cbd31573c7a0e_l3.png?resize=60%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="18" width="60" alt="p=1/2" class="ql-img-inline-formula " />) strategy actually gets the 2012 best of both worlds bound! This is truly surprising, as in principle mirror descent does not “know” anything about stochastic environments, it does not make any sophisticated concentration reasoning (say as in Lai and Robbins), yet it seems to automatically and optimally pick up on the regularity in the data. This is really amazing to me, and of course also a total surprise that the polynomial regularizer has such strong adaptivity property, while it was merely introduced to remove a benign log term.</p>
<p>The crucial observation of Zimmert and Seldin is that a a certain <em>self-bounding</em> property of the regret implies (in a one-line calculation) the best of both worlds result:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Lemma 1:</strong> Consider a strategy whose regret with respect to the optimal action <img src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9af0b76a90462b68c1d83fca9cc6604d_l3.png?resize=12%2C13&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="13" width="12" alt="i^*" class="ql-img-inline-formula " /> is upper bounded by</p>

<p><strong>Yet another one-line proof (okay, maybe 5 lines)</strong></p>
<p>Zimmert and Seldin proved that PolyINF with <img src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-d9aaa949f328021d5d7cbd31573c7a0e_l3.png?resize=60%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="18" width="60" alt="p=1/2" class="ql-img-inline-formula " /> actually satisfies the self-bounding property of Lemma 1 (and thus obtains the best of both worlds guarantee). In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08779" class="liinternal">another recent paper</a> by Zimmert, in joint work with Haipeng Luo and Chen-Yu Wei, they simplify the analysis by using a very mild variation of the PolyINF regularizer, namely <img src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-83b29164db23b237061cd205df4a585d_l3.png?resize=183%2C24&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="24" width="183" alt="- \sum_{i=1}^K (\sqrt{x_i} + \sqrt{1-x_i})" class="ql-img-inline-formula " />. In my view it’s the proof from the book for the best of both worlds result (or very close to it)! Here it is:</p>

<p>We were able to find four new papers for May 2019 — as usual, please let us know if we missed any!<br />EDIT: We did, in fact, miss one paper, which is the bottom one listed below.</p>



<p><strong>On Local Testability in the Non-Signaling Setting</strong>, by Alessandro Chiesa, Peter Manohar, and Igor Shinkar (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/070/">ECCC</a>).  This paper studies testability of a certain generalization of (distributions over) functions, known as \(k\)-non-signalling functions, objects which see use in hardness of approximation and delegation of computation. Prior work by the authors show the effectiveness of the linearity test in this setting, leading to the design of PCPs. On the other hand, in this work, the authors show that two types of bivariate tests are ineffective in revealing low-degree structure of these objects.</p>



<p><strong>Computing and Testing Small Vertex Connectivity in Near-Linear Time and Queries</strong>, by Danupon Nanongkai, Thatchaphol Saranurak, and Sorrachai Yingchareonthawornchai (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05329">arXiv</a>). This work, apparently simultaneous with the one by Forster and Yang that we covered <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/?p=1116">last month</a>, also studies the problem of locally computing cuts in a graph. The authors also go further, and study approximation algorithms for the same problems. Inspired by the connections to property testing in the work of Forster and Yang, they apply these approximation algorithms to get even more query-efficient algorithms for the problems of testing \(k\)-edge- and \(k\)-vertex-connectivity.</p>



<p><strong>Testing Graphs against an Unknown Distribution</strong>, by Lior Gishboliner and Asaf Shapira (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09903">arXiv</a>). This paper studies graph property testing, under the vertex-distribution-free (VDF) model, as <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/p_vdf.html">recently introduced</a> by Goldreich. In the VDF model, rather than the ability to sample a random node, the algorithm has the ability to sample a node from some unknown distribution, and must be accurate with respect to the same distribution (reminiscent of the PAC learning model). In Goldreich’s work, it was shown that every property which is testable in the VDF model is semi-hereditary. This work strengthens this statement and proves a converse, thus providing a characterization: a property is testable in the VDF model if and only if it is both hereditary and extendable. These descriptors roughly mean that the property is closed under both removal and addition of nodes (with the choice of addition of edges in the latter case). This is a far simpler characterization than that of properties which are testable in the standard model, which is a special case of the VDF model.</p>



<p><strong>Private Identity Testing for High-Dimensional Distributions</strong>, by Clément L. Canonne, Gautam Kamath, Audra McMillan, Jonathan Ullman, and Lydia Zakynthinou (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11947">arXiv</a>). This work continues a recent line on distribution testing under the constraint of differential privacy. The settings of interest are multivariate distributions: namely, product distributions over the hypercube and Gaussians with identity covariance. An application of a statistic of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03156">CDKS</a>, combined with a Lipschitz extension from the set of datasets likely to be generated by such structured distributions, gives a sample-efficient algorithm. A time-efficient version of this extension is also provided, at the cost of some loss in the sample complexity. Some tools of independent interest include reductions between Gaussian mean and product uniformity testing, balanced product identity to product uniformity testing, and an equivalence between univariate and “extreme” product identity testing. </p>



<p><strong>Testing Bipartitness in an Augmented VDF Bounded-Degree Graph Model</strong>, by Oded Goldreich (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03070">arXiv</a>). Another work on the vertex-distribution-free (VDF) model, as described above. In this one, Goldreich considers an augmentation of the model, where the algorithm is further allowed to query the probability of each node. With this augmentation, he gives \(\tilde O(\sqrt{n})\)-time algorithms for testing bipartiteness and cycle-free-ness, where \(n\) is the “effective support” of the distribution. That is, \(n\) is the number of nodes in the graph after discarding the nodes with minimal probability until \(\varepsilon/5\) mass is removed.</p></div>

<div class="content">
In this work we consider the interplay between multiprover interactive proofs, quantum
entanglement, and zero knowledge proofs — notions that are central pillars of complexity theory,
quantum information and cryptography. In particular, we study the relationship between the
complexity class MIP$^*$ , the set of languages decidable by multiprover interactive proofs with
quantumly entangled provers, and the class PZK-MIP$^*$ , which is the set of languages decidable
by MIP$^*$ protocols that furthermore possess the perfect zero knowledge property.

Our main result is that the two classes are equal, i.e., MIP$^*$ = PZK-MIP$^*$ . This result provides
a quantum analogue of the celebrated result of Ben-Or, Goldwasser, Kilian, and Wigderson (STOC
1988) who show that MIP = PZK-MIP (in other words, all classical multiprover interactive
protocols can be made zero knowledge). We prove our result by showing that every MIP$^*$
protocol can be efficiently transformed into an equivalent zero knowledge MIP$^*$ protocol in a
manner that preserves the completeness-soundness gap. Combining our transformation with
previous results by Slofstra (Forum of Mathematics, Pi 2019) and Fitzsimons, Ji, Vidick and
Yuen (STOC 2019), we obtain the corollary that all co-recursively enumerable languages (which
include undecidable problems as well as all decidable problems) have zero knowledge MIP$^*$
protocols with vanishing promise gap.</div>

Ray Miller, one of the founders of our field, passed away recently at the age of 90.<br />
<br />
He has associations with both GA Tech and The University of Maryland, so both Lance and I have a connection to him. As does Dick Lipton who has posted about him <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/08/raymond-edward-miller-just-passed-away/">here</a>.<br />
<br />
I present two guest blog-posts about him<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Post One</b>: From<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/lin">Ming C Lin</a><br />
<br />
Elizabeth Stevinson Chair of Computer Science<br />
<br />
University of Maryland at College Park<br />
<br />
<br />
Dear CS Alumni and Friends,<br />
<br />
We are deeply saddened to learn that Professor Emeritus Ray Miller passed away two nights ago around 9 pm.<br />
<br />
A Memorial Service at St. Andrews Lutheran Church (15300 New Hampshire Ave., Silver Spring MD  20905) for Dr. Miller will be held on Saturday, June 15th at 10:30 am.<br />
<br />
Dr. Ray Miller received his Ph.D. from University of Illinois in 1957.  He was a professor and the former Director of the School of Information and Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology before joining our department in 1988 as the Director of the Center of Excellence in Space Data and Information Science (CESDIS).   Dr. Miller was well known for his research on communication protocols, networks, distributed systems, parallel computation, and theory.<br />
<br />
In 1970, he became the Fellow of IEEE for the advancement of the theoretical understanding of computation through work in switching theory and theoretical models.<br />
<br />
In 1997, he was elevated to be a Fellow of ACM for research contributions to the theory of parallel computation and for his distinguished service to the Computer Science community as an educator and leader.<br />
<br />
In 2003, Dr. Miller was designated as a Fellow by the Computer Science Accreditation Board<br />
<br />
<i>"in recognition of his outstanding professional volunteer contributions to computing sciences </i><i>and accreditation”.</i><br />
<br />
Dr. Miller was also an AAAS Fellow,  and a Charter Member of IEEE Computer Society Golden Core;he received the IEEE Third Millennium Medal in 2000 and ACM Distinguished Service Award in 2002.<br />
<br />
Beyond his outstanding research contribution and devotion to education, Dr. Ray Miller has been known for his kindness as a colleague, supportiveness as a mentor, and effectiveness as a leader. Dr. Miller will be forever remembered warmly by his friends, colleagues and students for his dedication and service to our department, the University, and the field of computing at large.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Post Two</b>: From<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/ben/">Ben Shneiderman</a><br />
<br />
Emeritus Professor, University of Maryland at College Park.<br />
<br />
I was saddened to hear about the death of Ray Miller at age 90.  He was a dear colleague who contributed a great deal to computer science and to our department.  You can read his 84-page personal memoir at the IEEE Computer Society History Committee website: <a href="https://history.computer.org/pubs/ray-miller.pdf">here</a>.<br />
<br />
His memoirs tells his story in detail, describing his research collaborations in computational complexity, parallel algorithms, and program optimization and his leadership roles. You can see more about Ray’s work on his ACM author page: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81332515760">here</a><br />
<br />
<div>
This is the best source as he had no Google Scholar page or Wikipedia article that I could find. Ray’s quiet and modest style was a valuable asset, but his contributions come through in his memoir. He describes working with Turing Awardees John Cocke, Fran Allen, John Backus, Dick Karp, and other key figures, so maybe Ray should have received that award too.  Ray was also an excellent administrator and leader, who contributed to building the institutions (conferences, ACM, IEEE, etc.) that supported the growth of computer science.</div>
<div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Ray was especially kind to me in the early 1970s, when I was working on my Phd, developing a graph theoretic model of data structures.  As Assistant Director of the IBM Mathematical Science Department at the T. J. Watson Labs in Yorktown Heights, NY. This legendary IBM Research Lab was equal to Bell Labs and filled with computing pioneers in hardware, software, and applications.<br />
<br /></div>
<div>
Ray invited me to give a talk about my work, drawing interest from Arnold Rosenberg, who had been developing related ideas. With Ray’s support I returned for monthly visits with Arnie and Ray to refine my esoteric ideas leading to my May 1973 Phd.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Ray’s kindness as a colleague and supportiveness as a mentor will always be remembered warmly. Here are a few photos of Ray giving a talk in the CS Department, probably in 1985: <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/ray1.jpg">here,</a> <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/ray2.jpg">here</a>, and</div>

Ray Miller just passed away. He had been a researcher and leader at IBM Research, Georgia Tech, and University of Maryland. At all he did important research and also was a leader: a group head, a director, and a chair.</p>
<p>
Today we remember Ray.</p>
<p>
For starters you can read <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/news/237370-in-memoriam-raymond-e-ray-miller-1928-2019/fulltext">this</a> or his memoir <a href="https://history.computer.org/pubs/ray-miller.pdf">here</a>. Ray started in the field with an electrical engineering PhD <a href="https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/5131/filter-search">thesis</a> tilted <i>Formal Analysis and Synthesis of Bilateral Switching Networks</i>. See <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5222582">this</a> for his paper.</p>
<p>
Ray’s memoir does not mention tennis. But we played tennis when I visited IBM, and also when we could while at a conference. Ray was not slim, not fast, not obviously athletic. But he was the best tennis player in our group. He was miles above me. His trick was he could control the ball, especially on his serve so it was untouchable. He could spin it so that it landed and bounced at right angles. He was so good that he hardly ever had to move. When I played him in singles, we had to agree “no spinning serves”. When we played doubles there was a small chance that someone could return his ball, but not much.</p>
<p>
I think this is a fair way to summarize Ray: It was easy to underestimate him. Ray always had a smile on his face. I cannot remember him being anything but happy. This may led some to think he was not serious. But Ray was. He did wonderful research and was a leader in our field. He changed, for the better, all the places he called “home”. I can directly attest to his impact at Tech; others I believe can attest to IBM and Maryland. He was a great editor for <i>Journal of the ACM</i>, and did much more for our field. Thanks Ray.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Some Thoughts </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Here are just a few comments from friends of Ray.</p>
<p>
<i>Rich DeMillo</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Ray was a quiet but strong and effective leader and a good friend to many of us. Nancy Lynch and I recruited him to be School of ICS Director, bringing immediate stature—both internal and external—to computer science at Georgia Tech. Up until that time Information and Computer Science was an odd duck interdisciplinary graduate program in a very traditional engineering school that had not invested in the field despite the early success of the School of Information and Computer Science and a world-class Burroughs installation (Georgia Tech had played a key role in Algol development in the ’60s). Ray was an engineer with impeccable credentials and was taken seriously by the administration in ways that the library scientists, linguists, philosophers, psychologists, cyberneticists, and mathematicians who founded the School never managed to achieve. </em></p><em>
<p>
Dick Lipton and I were long term collaborators on theory research with Ray, and Rays’ presence helped shine a national spotlight on the School. He was the editor-in-chief of the Journal of the ACM and palled around with luminaries like Sam Winograd and Dick Karp. </p>
<p>
In addition to his own work in switching theory and automata, Ray had co-edited the volume in which Karp’s NP-completeness paper appeared, and so his name was forever associated with that ground-breaking paper. From that point on, Atlanta became a mandatory stop on the national research circuit that was the hallmark of theory research in those days. </p>
<p>
One of his first accomplishments was snagging the Computer Science Conference, the large, research-oriented conference for the field. It gave Georgia Tech a chance to showcase its work for the rest of the world. There was a steady rise in rankings and a steady flow of visitors like Michael Rabin, Leslie Lamport, Mike Fisher, Andy Yao, Ravi Kannan, in addition to Karp, Winograd, and Lipton. Ray tried to entice Lipton to Georgia Tech with what was at the time the university’s juiciest startup package. He was ultimately successful, but it took nearly twenty years, and by that time, Tech had replaced the School of ICS with the College of Computing, and Ray was in semi-retirement in Maryland. </p>
</em><p><em>
</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
<i>Umakishore Ramachandran</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> I have fond memories of my early years at Tech after being recruited by Ray to join the small but vibrant group of faculty in ICS specializing in theory, systems, and AI. Ray was extremely caring and supportive in nurturing junior faculty. One could say that Ray’s leadership was instrumental in the transformation of CS at Georgia Tech and putting GT on the map to compete with other more established CS departments around the nation.</em></p><em>
<p>
Ray helped create a sense of family in the department. I recall every day he would be at lunch in the faculty club which in those days served coffee at $0.10. He would be there eating a healthy meal featuring a giant sausage and reserving an entire table for the ICS faculty to join him for lunch. It created such a friendly and amicable environment for discussing any issue.</p>
<p>
I feel compelled to share a lighter anecdote when I got hired by Ray. Those were the days of terminals connected to mini computers, DEC VAX 750 and 780, and I wanted Ray to promise me that he will give me a terminal and modem for connecting to the campus computers from home. Even as a grad student at UW-Madison I had a 2400 baud modem at home. When I arrived at Tech, Ray gave me a 300-baud acoustic coupler since I had not specified what speed modem I wanted in my startup package. Ray had a giant infectious smile all the time that made it difficult to get mad at him for anything. Note: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B300+%5Cll+2400%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{300 \ll 2400}" class="latex" title="{300 \ll 2400}" />.</p>
</em><p><em>
He will be missed by anyone and everyone whose lives he touched. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
<i>Bill Gasarch</i></p>
<p>
Here is a short quote from Bill and see his post for more details.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> I was saddened to hear of Ray Miller’s death. He was at University of Maryland for many years. Since he got his PhD in 1957 and was still active into the 2000’s he had a broad view of computer science. He did theory AND systems AND other things. It was great to talk to him about the early days of computer science before we had these labels. </em>
</p></blockquote>

Ray is missed. Our condolences to his family and his many friends for their loss.</p>

<p>Suppose you have a fill-in-the-unknowns puzzle, like Sudoku. Can making some deductions and filling in those parts of the puzzle make the whole thing harder to solve than it was before you started? Sometimes, yes!</p>

<p>I have in mind human-style puzzle-deduction rules, where you see a piece of the puzzle that matches some pattern and use that to deduce what one of the unknowns should be. And by “harder” I mean that a puzzle that was previously possible to solve by some set of deduction rules, after the deduction, stopped being possible for those rules to solve. Of course this is possible if you have a bad set of deduction rules. But normally, at least for the kinds of patterns I think about when solving puzzles, if a pattern matches in a partially completed puzzle, then it or a simplification of it will continue to match no matter how I fill in more of the unknowns. Most of the deduction pattern that I use are monotonic, in this sense. If you had a collection of patterns that was not monotonic, you could add all ways of partially filling them in to your collection, and get a better set of patterns, right?</p>

<p>Wrong! There can be valid deduction patterns for which this extension to monotonic sets would produce invalid patterns. I’m pretty sure this can happen in Sudoku, actually, but the example I have in mind comes from a different puzzle game I’ve been playing lately, part of Simon Tatham’s puzzle collection, where it’s called “map”. It’s based on the problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precoloring_extension">precoloring extension</a>: you’re given a partially 4-colored planar map, and you have to fill in the rest of the colors.
And it’s trivially NP-complete, by a reduction from planar 3-coloring (augment a 3-coloring instance by extra vertices of the fourth color, preventing any of the given instance vertices from having that color) but the puzzles usually presented by the puzzle app are solvable by hand, even when they’re large and at the highest of its levels of difficulty.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/map-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the map puzzle from Simon Tatham's puzzle collection" /></p>

<p>If that were all, then I think all deduction rules could be made monotonic. But I’m going to tell you one more thing about the puzzle, and this one thing makes it non-monotonic. It is that, like Sudoku, every puzzle has a unique solution.
And <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2005/10/15/assuming-uniqueness-in.html">like Sudoku, the assumption of uniqueness leads to new deduction rules</a>.
You can infer that certain regions have to have certain colors, because if they could be colored anything else then there would be more than one solution.</p>

<p>To see how this works, suppose I had a map like the one shown below (where the white squares have not yet been colored, and I’m only showing a small piece of a larger puzzle):</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/nonmon1.svg" alt="Uncolored pocket in a map puzzle" /></p>

<p>There’s a pocket of uncolored squares extending into the colored region on the left. If I colored the square at the mouth of the pocket yellow, the inner square of the puzzle would be ambiguous: it has only yellow and blue neighbors, so it could be either red or black.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/nonmon2.svg" alt="Ambiguously colored pocket in a map puzzle" /></p>

<p>To prevent this ambiguity, the square at the mouth of the pocket must be black. And to force it to be black, the square one step beyond the mouth must be yellow. So from the initial state and the assumption of a unique solution, it’s possible to infer the colors of three previously-blank squares:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/nonmon3.svg" alt="Ambiguously colored pocket in a map puzzle" /></p>

<p>But if I have multiple rules at hand, it’s natural for me to try the weaker and easier ones first. Suppose I had done this, and used a weaker inference rule telling me that the square at the mouth was black.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/nonmon4.svg" alt="Partially colored pocket in a map puzzle" /></p>

<p>Or suppose I had used a rule that produced the valid (but even weaker) inference that the inner square must be red.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/nonmon5.svg" alt="Even more partially colored pocket in a map puzzle" /></p>

<p>Now I can’t use my strong inference rule and color the outer squares! I’ve lost the information about why I colored the inner pocket squares the way I did, and so I’ve lost the ability to make deductions about how the outer squares should be colored to avoid ambiguities. It would not be a valid pattern to see a puzzle in these states and deduce the color of the remaining squares associated with the pocket. So the extension from my initial (valid) rule, which filled in all three squares when they were all blank, to a monotonic rule that fills in the partially-filled-in pocket in the same way, would be invalid. Of course, if the puzzle solution was unique before, it must still be unique after partially filling in the pocket. But with fewer squares colored, my deductive abilities might not be up to the task of reasoning from the remaining parts of the puzzle to its unique solution.</p>

<p>For the same reason, I might not actually want to color yellow the square beyond the mouth, forgetting why it needs to be yellow. Because what I can infer from the initial state is not merely that it should be colored yellow: it’s that the three outer neighbors of this square must have a permutation of the three other colors, so that this square is forced to be yellow, so that the rest of the pocket will have an unambiguous coloring.</p>

<p>I think what this means is that my knowledge representation (consisting only of blank or filled-in puzzle regions) is inadequate. In practice, I actually use a more complex knowledge representation where (either in my head or with markers provided in the puzzle app) I keep track of which colors are still available for the blank regions, but it’s still inadequate, in the same way. It’s not clear to me what the right knowledge representation is, to allow me to keep track of chains of inferences like “one of these squares must be red to prevent this square from becoming yellow to prevent its neighbor from becoming ambiguous” without the complexity of what I remember for each square blowing up to non-constant.</p>

Ken Regan just wrote about his paper with Chaowen Guan (GR). The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00101">paper</a> is titled, “Stabilizer Circuits, Quadratic Forms, and Computing Matrix Rank.”</p>
<p>
Today I thought I would add some additional comments on their result.</p>
<p>
The post Ken wrote is thorough, detailed, and geared for an expert in quantum computation. I think he did a service to the field of quantum complexity theory with his write-up. But I thought too that there some things that he neglected to say: things that could be interesting to a wider community. So with all due respect I hope this short discussion is useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Quantum Circuits </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
In studying classic computations, we can restrict our attention to Boolean circuits. Moreover, these circuits can be assumed to consist of one type of gate. A formal way to say this is: Circuits that use NAND gates are <i>universal</i>. Any computation can be converted into a circuit that only uses this type of gate. It is now viewed as a trivial observation, but was not obvious in the beginning. Note, AND and OR and NOT can be implemented with just NAND gates.</p>
<p>
The understanding of what gate types are universal is not only of interest to theorists. Some technologies support directly some types of gates, while others support different types. For example the dominant CMOS technology efficiently implements NAND gates. </p>

In studying quantum computations, we can also restrict our attention to <i>quantum circuits</i>. These circuits need only use gates from a small family. These gate types are more complex than just NAND gates, as you might expect since quantum circuits manipulate qubits and not just bits. I believe that it is fair to say that the fact that there are universal gates for quantum circuits is not trivial. There are many types of gates that are studied: Clifford, NOT, Fredkin, Hadamard, Toffoli, and many others.</p>
<p>
Again the understanding of what gate types are universal is not only of interest to theorists. Quantum circuits are not easy to build, the technology is still evolving. There is yet no CMOS answer to the question: How do we build quantum hardware? Errors may be the limiting factor for large quantum circuits. We will see. One consequence of the difficulty of building universal quantum circuits is the interest in circuits that use gates that are from a family that is <i>not universal</i>.</p>
<p>
The hope is several fold: </p>
<ul>
<li>
Perhaps understanding gates that are not universal will help us understand general quantum computations. <p></p>
</li><li>
Perhaps some important problems in chemistry, for example, may be solvable with these non-universal circuits. <p></p>
</li><li>
Perhaps the mathematics of these restricted circuits will be interesting in its own right.
</li></ul>
<p>
The third point is where GR’s work falls.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Stabilizer Circuits </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The class of quantum circuits that GR studied are the <i>stabilizer circuits</i>. See this for an earlier discussion on these <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/07/08/grilling-quantum-circuits/">circuits</a>. The key is that these circuits are not universal. And more importantly they can be simulated by classical computers in polynomial time. In the upside-down world of quantum complexity theory, the ability to efficiently simulate them is bad. In order to show that quantum computations are new and exciting, being able to simulate them on your laptop is not good.</p>
<p>
The punch-line is: how efficient is this simulation? There are polynomial algorithms and there are useful polynomial algorithms. The 2004 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406196">paper</a> by Scott Aaronson and Daniel Gottesman (AG) says that the time complexity is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^2)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^2)}" />. Looks good.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> A Breakthrough? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
For a few hours, maybe days, GR thought they could show that stabilizer circuits solve the matrix rank problem. In part this was based on a misunderstanding, but it was also based on not needing the full generality of maintaining the system between single-qubit measurements. If they could calculate or even estimate the probability of just one all-qubits measurement in time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^2)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^2)}" /> then the same time would apply to computing matrix rank over the field <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathbb{F}_2}" class="latex" title="{\mathbb{F}_2}" />. This would have been an immense result. The best known is that the rank of a matrix can be computed in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7B%5Comega%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n^{\omega}}" class="latex" title="{n^{\omega}}" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Comega%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\omega}" class="latex" title="{\omega}" /> is the current exponent for multiplying <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Ctimes+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n \times n}" class="latex" title="{n \times n}" /> matrices—over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathbb{F}_2}" class="latex" title="{\mathbb{F}_2}" /> or any field. Today <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Comega%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\omega}" class="latex" title="{\omega}" /> stands at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2.3728%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2.3728\dots}" class="latex" title="{2.3728\dots}" />. </p>
<p>
Clearly, they were excited. I still recall Ken calling me with the possible news. I thought that it was not a crazy idea. Their plan was: </p>
<ol>
<li>
Reduce matrix rank to a quantum problem; <p></p>
</li><li>
Show that problem could be computed by stabilizer circuits; <p></p>
</li><li>
Then invoke the simulation theorem for these circuits to get a classical algorithm.
</li></ol>
<p>Wow. This trip from a classic problem, to a quantum one, and back was intriguing. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Saving Grace </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Quickly GR figured out the issue. They could in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^2)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^2)}" /> total time determine the probability of each individual qubit being <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0}" class="latex" title="{0}" />. That probability would be either <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\frac{1}{2}}" class="latex" title="{\frac{1}{2}}" /> since their reduction from rank gives a circuit in which the probability of getting all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0}" class="latex" title="{0}" />s is guaranteed to be positive. If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k}" class="latex" title="{k}" /> values are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\frac{1}{2}}" class="latex" title="{\frac{1}{2}}" /> that does not make the answer <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%5Ek%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\frac{1}{2^k}}" class="latex" title="{\frac{1}{2^k}}" />, because of entanglements. They had thought that the Aaronson-Gottesman algorithm took care of the entanglement bookkeeping in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^2)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^2)}" /> time, but it services only one qubit in that time. Ironically, AG expressly note that they improved Gottesman’s earlier <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E%5Comega%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^\omega)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^\omega)}" /> time for this task to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^2)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^2)}" />—exactly what GR thought they would get—but AG still only get <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E3%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^3)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^3)}" /> time for operations involving all the qubits.</p>
<p>
GR worked out the full picture from a more-recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03554">paper</a> by Héctor García-Ramírez and Igor Markov of Michigan, which describes detailed software for simulating stabilizer circuits. Thus the quantum method would only put matrix rank into cubic time—not new. But then they realized that the goalposts for a result in the <em>other</em> direction were only <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E3%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^3)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^3)}" />. This they could beat with most of their hard work already done. Thus they can improve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E3%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^3)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^3)}" /> cases by AG and some subsequent papers to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E%5Comega%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^\omega)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^\omega)}" />. In theory, that is—the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E%5Comega%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^\omega)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^\omega)}" /> algorithms are galactic. But what GR also have is a pretty result that is not galactic at all:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> If membership in a certain class of undirected <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />-vertex graphs can be decided in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^2)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^2)}" /> time, then the following problems all have the same time complexity: </em></p><em>
<ol>
<li>
The strong simulation of quantum stabilizer circuits; <p></p>
</li><li>
The computation of the rank of matrices over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D_2%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathbb{F}_2}" class="latex" title="{\mathbb{F}_2}" />; <p></p>
</li><li>
The counting of solutions to classical quadratic forms modulo <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{4}" class="latex" title="{4}" />.
</li></ol>
</em><p><em></em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Note that all these problems have upper bounds of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%5Comega%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n^\omega}" class="latex" title="{n^\omega}" /> by GR; the point is that their bounds would coincide even if matrix rank turns out to be easier than matrix multiplication. The next post will talk about the class of graphs. Just to be clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>
If the graphs are in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^2)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^2)}" /> time, this does not mean the problems are all in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^2)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^2)}" /> time—they could still need <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%5Comega%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n^\omega}" class="latex" title="{n^\omega}" /> time. <p></p>
</li><li>
The graphs are in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E%5Comega%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^\omega)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^\omega)}" /> time. This is for dense graphs with order-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n^2}" class="latex" title="{n^2}" /> edges. <p></p>
</li><li>
The reductions from rank to the other problems run in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^2)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^2)}" /> time unconditionally—the graphs involved are all bipartite so their status is known.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I hope that this discussion helps shed some light on the new result of GR. I hope that raising the covers on how they found their theorem is useful. Research is not smooth, is not a straight-line from start to finish, and their journey is not atypical.</p>

We prove that the Or function on $n$ bits can be point-wise approximated with error $\eps$ by a polynomial of degree $O(k)$ and weight $2^{O(n \log (1/\eps)/k)}$, for any $k \geq \sqrt{n \log 1/\eps}$.  This result is tight for all $k$.  Previous results were either not tight or had $\eps = \Omega(1)$.  In general we obtain an approximation result for any symmetric function, also tight.  Building on this we also obtain an approximation result for bounded-width CNF.  For these two classes no such result was known.

One motivation for such results comes from the study of indistinguishability.
Two distributions $P$, $Q$ over $n$-bit strings are $(k,\delta)$-indistinguishable if their projections on any $k$ bits have statistical distance at most $\delta$.
The above approximations give values of $(k,\delta)$ that suffice to fool symmetric functions and bounded-width CNF, and the first result is tight.
Finally, we show that any two $(k, \delta)$-indistinguishable distributions are $O(n)^{k/2}\delta$-close to two distributions that are $(k,0)$-indistinguishable, improving the previous bound of $O(n)^k \delta$.</div>
