<div class="content">
Recently, Forbes, Kumar and Saptharishi [CCC, 2016] proved that there exists an explicit $d^{O(1)}$-variate and degree $d$ polynomial $P_{d} \in VNP$ such that if any depth four circuit $C$ of bounded formal degree $d$ which computes a polynomial of bounded individual degree $O(1)$, that is functionally equivalent to $P_d$, then $C$ must have size $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{d}\log{d})}$.

The motivation for their work comes from Boolean Circuit Complexity. Based on a characterization for $ACC^0$ circuits by Yao [FOCS, 1985] and Beigel and Tarui [CC, 1994], Forbes, Kumar and Saptharishi [CCC, 2016] observed that functions in $ACC^0$ can also be computed by algebraic $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuits (i.e., circuits of the form -- sums of powers of polynomials) of $2^{\log^{O(1)}n}$ size. Thus they argued that a $2^{\omega(\log^{O(1)}{n})}$ "functional" lower bound for an explicit polynomial $Q$ against $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuits would imply a lower bound for the "corresponding Boolean function" of $Q$ against non-uniform $ACC^0$. In their work, they ask if their lower bound be extended to $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuits.

In this paper, for large integers $n$ and $d$ such that $\Omega(\log^2{n})\leq d\leq n^{0.01}$, we show that any $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuit of bounded individual degree at most $O(\frac{d}{k^2})$ that functionally computes Iterated Matrix Multiplication polynomial $IMM_{n,d}$ ($\in VP$) over $\{0,1\}^{n^2d}$ must have size $n^{\Omega(k)}$. Since Iterated Matrix Multiplication $IMM_{n,d}$ over $\{0,1\}^{n^2d}$ is functionally in $GapL$, improvement of the afore mentioned lower bound to hold for quasipolynomially large values of individual degree would imply a fine-grained separation of $ACC^0$ from $GapL$.

For the sake of completeness, we also show a syntactic size lower bound against any $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuit computing $IMM_{n,d}$ (for the same regime of $d$) which is tight over large fields. Like Forbes, Kumar and Saptharishi [CCC, 2016], we too prove lower bounds against circuits of bounded formal degree which functionally compute $IMM_{n,d}$, for a slightly larger range of individual degree.</div>

unknown depth-2 feedforward neural network with general ReLU activations, under
mild non-degeneracy assumptions. In particular, we consider learning an unknown
network of the form $f(x) = {a}^{\mathsf{T}}\sigma({W}^\mathsf{T}x+b)$, where
$x$ is drawn from the Gaussian distribution, and $\sigma(t) := \max(t,0)$ is
the ReLU activation. Prior works for learning networks with ReLU activations
assume that the bias $b$ is zero. In order to deal with the presence of the
bias terms, our proposed algorithm consists of robustly decomposing multiple
higher order tensors arising from the Hermite expansion of the function $f(x)$.
Using these ideas we also establish identifiability of the network parameters
under minimal assumptions.

that come from using Shor's algorithm to reduce the complexity of prime
factorization. However, this promise hast not yet been realized due to noisy
qubits and lack of robust error correction schemes. Here we explore a
promising, alternative method for prime factorization that uses
well-established techniques from variational imaginary time evolution. We
create a Hamiltonian whose ground state encodes the solution to the problem and
use variational techniques to evolve a state iteratively towards these prime
factors. We show that the number of circuits evaluated in each iteration scales
as O(n^{5}d), where n is the bit-length of the number to be factorized and $d$
is the depth of the circuit. We use a single layer of entangling gates to
factorize several numbers represented using 7, 8, and 9-qubit Hamiltonians. We
also verify the method's performance by implementing it on the IBMQ Lima
hardware.

-a special case of liveness-guarantees, which ensure the termination of
individual method calls under system fairness assumptions. Liveness properties
have been proposed for concurrent objects. Typical liveness properties
includelock-freedom,wait-freedom,deadlock-freedom,starvation-freedom and
obstruction-freedom. It is known that the five liveness properties above are
decidable on the Sequential Consistency (SC) memory model for a bounded number
of processes. However, the problem of decidability of liveness for finite state
concurrent programs running on relaxed memory models remains open. In this
paper we address this problem for the Total Store Order (TSO) memory model,as
found in the x86 architecture. We prove that lock-freedom,
wait-freedom,deadlock-freedom and starvation-freedom are undecidable on TSO for
a bounded number of processes, while obstruction-freedom is decidable.

Given a graph $G$ with vertex thresholds $\tau$, consider a dynamic process in
which vertex $v$ becomes activated once at least $\tau(v)$ of its neighbors are
activated. A vertex set $S$ is called a target set if all vertices of $G$ would
be activated when initially activating vertices of $S$. In the Target Set
Reconfiguration problem, given two target sets $X$ and $Y$ of the same size, we
are required to determine whether $X$ can be transformed into $Y$ by repeatedly
swapping one vertex in the current set with another vertex not in the current
set preserving every intermediate set as a target set. In this paper, we
investigate the complexity of Target Set Reconfiguration in restricted cases.
On the hardness side, we prove that Target Set Reconfiguration is
PSPACE-complete on bipartite planar graphs of degree $3$ or $4$ and of
threshold $2$, bipartite $3$-regular graphs of threshold $1$ or $2$, and split
graphs, which is in contrast to the fact that a special case called Vertex
Cover Reconfiguration is in P for the last graph class. On the positive side,
we present a polynomial-time algorithm for Target Set Reconfiguration on graphs
of maximum degree $2$ and trees. The latter result can be thought of as a
generalization of that for Vertex Cover Reconfiguration.

tuberculosis, and COVID-19. Manual investigations by human contact tracers
remain a dominant way in which this is carried out. This process is limited by
the number of contact tracers available, who are often overburdened during an
outbreak or epidemic. As a result, a crucial decision in any contact tracing
strategy is, given a set of contacts, which person should a tracer trace next?
In this work, we develop a formal model that articulates these questions and
provides a framework for comparing contact tracing strategies. Through
analyzing our model, we give provably optimal prioritization policies via a
clean connection to a tool from operations research called a "branching
bandit". Examining these policies gives qualitative insight into trade-offs in
contact tracing applications.

machine-learned predictions to overcome worst case lower bounds. This area has
revealed interesting algorithmic insights into problems, with particular
success in the design of competitive online algorithms. However, the question
of improving algorithm running times with predictions has largely been
unexplored.
</p>
<p>We take a first step in this direction by combining the idea of
machine-learned predictions with the idea of "warm-starting" primal-dual
algorithms. We consider one of the most important primitives in combinatorial
optimization: weighted bipartite matching and its generalization to
$b$-matching. We identify three key challenges when using learned dual
variables in a primal-dual algorithm. First, predicted duals may be infeasible,
so we give an algorithm that efficiently maps predicted infeasible duals to
nearby feasible solutions. Second, once the duals are feasible, they may not be
optimal, so we show that they can be used to quickly find an optimal solution.
Finally, such predictions are useful only if they can be learned, so we show
that the problem of learning duals for matching has low sample complexity. We
validate our theoretical findings through experiments on both real and
synthetic data. As a result we give a rigorous, practical, and empirically
effective method to compute bipartite matchings.

more parameters. Many of these applications fall into the "Source-Sink
Monotone" framework, a special case of Topkis's monotonic optimization
framework, which implies that the parametric min cuts are nested. When there is
a single parameter, this property implies that the number of distinct min cuts
is linear in the number of nodes, which is quite useful for constructing
algorithms to identify all possible min cuts.
</p>
<p>When there are multiple Source-Sink Monotone parameters and the vector of
parameters are ordered in the usual vector sense, the resulting min cuts are
still nested. However, the number of distinct min cuts was an open question. We
show that even with only two parameters, the number of distinct min cuts can be
exponential in the number of nodes.

training. Collecting this data at scale inevitably causes label noise.Hence,the
need to develop learning algorithms that are robust to label noise. In recent
years, k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) emerged as a viable solution to this problem.
Despite its success, kNN is not without its problems. Mainly, it requires a
huge memory footprint to store all the training samples and it needs an
advanced data structure to allow for fast retrieval of the relevant examples,
given a query sample. We propose a neural network, termed kNet, that learns to
perform kNN. Once trained, we no longer need to store the training data, and
processing a query sample is a simple matter of inference. To use kNet, we
first train a preliminary network on the data set, and then train kNet on the
penultimate layer of the preliminary network.We find that kNet gives a smooth
approximation of kNN,and cannot handle the sharp label changes between samples
that kNN can exhibit. This indicates that currently kNet is best suited to
approximate kNN with a fairly large k. Experiments on two data sets show that
this is the regime in which kNN works best,and can therefore be replaced by
kNet.In practice, kNet consistently improve the results of all preliminary
networks, in all label noise regimes, by up to 3%.

<p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/c/Chillara:Suryajith.html">Suryajith Chillara</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.09703">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>Recently, Forbes, Kumar and Saptharishi [CCC, 2016] proved that there exists
an explicit $d^{O(1)}$-variate and degree $d$ polynomial $P_{d}\in VNP$ such
that if any depth four circuit $C$ of bounded formal degree $d$ which computes
a polynomial of bounded individual degree $O(1)$, that is functionally
equivalent to $P_d$, then $C$ must have size $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{d}\log{d})}$.
</p>
<p>The motivation for their work comes from Boolean Circuit Complexity. Based on
a characterization for $ACC^0$ circuits by Yao [FOCS, 1985] and Beigel and
Tarui [CC, 1994], Forbes, Kumar and Saptharishi [CCC, 2016] observed that
functions in $ACC^0$ can also be computed by algebraic
$\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuits (i.e., circuits of the form -- sums
of powers of polynomials) of $2^{\log^{O(1)}n}$ size. Thus they argued that a
$2^{\omega(\log^{O(1)}{n})}$ "functional" lower bound for an explicit
polynomial $Q$ against $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuits would imply a
lower bound for the "corresponding Boolean function" of $Q$ against non-uniform
$ACC^0$. In their work, they ask if their lower bound be extended to
$\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuits.
</p>
<p>In this paper, for large integers $n$ and $d$ such that $\omega(\log^2n)\leq
d\leq n^{0.01}$, we show that any $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuit of
bounded individual degree at most $O\left(\frac{d}{k^2}\right)$ that
functionally computes Iterated Matrix Multiplication polynomial $IMM_{n,d}$
($\in VP$) over $\{0,1\}^{n^2d}$ must have size $n^{\Omega(k)}$. Since Iterated
Matrix Multiplication $IMM_{n,d}$ over $\{0,1\}^{n^2d}$ is functionally in
$GapL$, improvement of the afore mentioned lower bound to hold for
quasipolynomially large values of individual degree would imply a fine-grained
separation of $ACC^0$ from $GapL$.

Even if I’ve been saying similar things on this blog for 15 years, I clearly haven’t been doing so in a style that works for everyone.  Quantum information needs as many people as possible who will tell the truth as best they see it, unencumbered by any competing interests, and has nothing legitimate to fear from that.

And there’s no symmetry to the situation: no matter how terrified you (or I) might feel about wokeists and their denunciation campaigns, the Democrats have no comparable effort to suppress Republican votes.  Alas, I don’t know of any solutions beyond the obvious one, of trying to deal the conspiracy-addled grievance party crushing defeats in 2022 and 2024.</li></ol></div>

<p>This is the sixth and final post in the series, on trends in machine learning theory, written by <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~mglasgow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Margalit Glasgow</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/michal-moshkovitz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michal Moshkovitz</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/cyrusrashtchian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyrus Rashtchian</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />Throughout the last few decades, we have witnessed unprecedented growth of machine learning. Originally a topic formalized by a small group of computer scientists, machine learning now impacts many areas: the physical sciences, medicine, commerce, finance, urban planning, and more. The rapid growth of machine learning can be partially attributed to the availability of large amounts of data and the development of powerful computing devices. Another important factor is that machine learning has foundations in many other fields, such as theoretical computer science, algorithms, applied mathematics, statistics, and optimization. </p>



<p>If machine learning is already mathematically rooted in many existing research areas, why do we need a field solely dedicated to learning theory? According to <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~djhsu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daniel Hsu</a>, “Learning theory serves (at least) two purposes: to help make sense of machine learning, and also to explore the capabilities and limitations of learning algorithms.” Besides finding innovative applications for existing tools, learning theorists also provide answers to long-standing problems and ask new fundamental questions. </p>



<p>Modern learning theory goes beyond classical statistical and computer science paradigms by: </p>



<ul><li>developing insights about specific computational models (e.g., neural networks) </li><li>analyzing popular learning algorithms (e.g., stochastic gradient descent)</li><li>taking into account data distributions (e.g., margin bounds or manifold assumptions)</li><li>adding auxiliary goals (e.g., robustness or privacy), and </li><li>rethinking how algorithms interact with and access data (e.g., online or reinforcement learning).</li></ul>



<p>By digging deep into the basic questions, researchers generate new concepts and models that change the way we solve problems and help us understand emerging phenomena.</p>



<p>This article provides a brief overview of three key areas in machine learning theory: new learning paradigms, trustworthy machine learning, and reinforcement learning. We describe the main thrust of each of these areas, as well as point to a few papers from <a href="http://algorithmiclearningtheory.org/alt2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ALT 2021</a> (the 32nd International Conference on Algorithmic Learning Theory) that touch each of these topics. To share a broader view, we also asked experts in the areas to comment on the field and on their recent papers. Needless to say, this article only scratches the surface. At the end, we point to places to learn more about learning theory.</p>



<span id="more-304"></span>



<p><strong>New Machine Learning Paradigms</strong><br />The traditional learning theory framework, probably approximately correct (PAC) learning, defines what it means to learn a ground-truth classifier from a candidate class of possible classifiers. Alongside PAC learning is Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theory, which characterizes the number of samples needed and sufficient to learn a classifier from a given class. The generalization analysis from VC theory is restricted to guarantees that hold independently of the data distribution — that is, even for worst-case distributions. Additionally, the VC/PAC learning paradigm suggests that whenever learning is possible, it can be accomplished by choosing the classifier that minimizes loss on the training data, called the empirical risk minimizer (ERM). </p>



<p>This classical framework unfortunately fails to explain the empirical success of machine learning (ML). “The distribution-free setting, while it comes with the elegant VC theory, turned out to be unsatisfactory,” says Csaba Szepesvári. “Due to the oversimplified setting, the theory could not contribute meaningfully to understanding all kinds of learning methods such as learning with trees, boosting, neural networks, SVMs, or using any other nonparametric methods.” Researchers posit that stronger guarantees should be possible if we leverage natural assumptions about the data distribution, though identifying the right “natural assumptions” is a challenging task. Similarly, understanding which of many possible ERM solutions a learning algorithm chooses may yield better generalization results than those yielded by VC theory. </p>



<p>Methods that provide <em>distribution-specific </em>guarantees aren’t new to learning theory. A canonical example is known as a margin bound, where the test error of a classifier is analyzed in terms of the margin that separates the different prediction categories. In <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/hanneke21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one</a> of the ALT best papers, Steve Hanneke and Aryeh Kontorovich prove generalization guarantees in terms of the size of the margin for two popular classification algorithms: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support vector machines</a> (SVMs) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perceptron</a> algorithm. The authors answer a core open question, showing that SVMs achieve the optimal margin bound!</p>



<p>Further work at ALT uses an assumption that data lies on a low-dimensional manifold to prove guarantees for generative models. Generative models synthesize <em>original</em> samples, such as images or text, that resemble training data, but without copying the data directly. While so-called <em>generative adversarial networks</em> work well in practice, few guarantees exist because it is challenging to statistically formulate the requirement of generating original samples. Nicolas Schreuder, Victor-Emmanuel Brunel, and Arnak S. Dalalyan consider a new framework in their <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/schreuder21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>, in which they guarantee originality by outputting a continuous distribution, which ensures that it is very unlikely to output training examples. If the training data is generated from a low-dimensional manifold, they show that it is possible to learn a good generator, which outputs a smooth transformation of a random point.</p>



<p>In another <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/tosh21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>, Christopher Tosh, Akshay Krishnamurthy, and Daniel Hsu use distributional assumptions to show when unsupervised methods can use unlabeled data to learn useful <em>representations </em>of data. A linear function trained on these representations and some labeled data can then be used for downstream prediction of the labels. The key idea is to look at when data has <em>multiview redundancy (MVR), </em>which arises, for instance, when data is augmented: Under MVR, each data point can be viewed as a pair (<em>X,</em> <em>Z</em>), and the label <em>Y</em> can be predicted almost as well from <em>X</em> or <em>Z</em> as from the full pair. For instance, each pair might be two halves of an article, or two rotations of an image. The authors show how a theoretical approach called <em>landmark embedding </em>can produce a representation that enables low-error linear classification. Additionally, they analyze when the representations are learned implicitly while training a model to predict whether two views <em>X</em> and <em>Z</em> correspond to the same example, which is close to what is done in practice. </p>



<p>Another new paradigm considers how the specific<em> training algorithm</em> affects which of many candidate ERM solutions are chosen. This is called the <em>implicit bias </em>of a training algorithm: If there are multiple equally good solutions, then why does an algorithm choose one over the other? This is particularly relevant when studying neural networks, which are typically<em> overparameterized</em> and can be trained to find many solutions with zero empirical risk. In one <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/ji21a/ji21a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>, Ziwei Ji and Matus Telgarsky characterize the implicit bias of using gradient descent to train a linear classifier with a general loss function. They show that the solution relates to the optimizer of a particular smoothed margin function. While this paper does not yield generalization guarantees, this type of implicit bias analysis can sometimes lead to generalization guarantees via margin bounds.</p>



<p>The goal of this area is to go beyond traditional learning theory paradigms by leveraging distributional and algorithmic properties. But a major open question is designing a more general mathematical theory that exploits such properties. <a href="http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~shaymrn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shay Moran</a> offers a standard for new theory: “I hope that in the next 10 years we will develop more realistic models of learning, but I will insist that they still be mathematically clean.”</p>



<p><strong>Trustworthy ML</strong><br />Machine learning has inspired many new areas and technologies: personalized health care, drug discovery, advertising, résumé screening, credit loans, and more. However, these critical and user-centered applications require a higher standard of testing and verification because mistakes may deeply affect many people. Addressing these challenges has inspired a new field of research centered on making machine learning more trustworthy and reliable, which is the motivation for many of the ALT papers this year as well. An expert in the area, <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~kamalika/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kamalika Chaudhuri</a>, says, “For my field, which is trustworthy ML, the theoretical goal and challenge remains modeling and frameworks.” She elaborates: “Coming up with new conceptual frameworks for learning has always been one of the core challenges in learning theory since its early days, and it is doubly important now.” Researchers have been exploring this direction in many areas, including privacy, data deletion, robustness, fairness, interpretability, and causality. </p>



<p>Several ALT 2021 papers cover questions in privacy. The general goal is to understand how to modify existing learning methods to take into account privacy constraints. One of the <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/wang21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">papers</a>, by Di Wang, Huanyu Zhang, Marco Gaboardi, and Jinhui Xu, considers generalized linear models in a differential privacy model. A central motivation is to understand the role of public, unlabeled data in improving the learnability of these problems in a private setting. Summarizing another direction, <a href="http://www.gautamkamath.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gautam Kamath</a> comments on his <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/aden-ali21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a> with co-authors Ishaq Aden-Ali and Hassan Ashtiani, “This paper focuses on a very simple but surprisingly challenging question: Can we learn a general multivariate Gaussian under the constraint of differential privacy? Prior works focused on restricted settings — for example, with bounded parameters or known covariance. We gave the first finite sample complexity bound for this problem, which evidence suggests is near optimal. The next question is to design a computationally efficient algorithm for this problem.” Another <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/cesar21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a> on privacy, by Mark Cesar and Ryan Rogers, studies the <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">composition</a> of various privacy mechanisms in the context of real-world data analytics pipelines.</p>



<p>Another aspect of respecting user privacy is allowing people to choose to stop sharing their data. Concretely, this means removing their data from data sets and ensuring that existing and future models do not make use of their data in any way. One name for this process is <em>machine unlearning</em>, and the main challenge is removing the data efficiently without retraining all models from scratch. One <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/neel21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>, by Seth Neel, Aaron Roth, and Saeed Sharifi-Malvajerdi, addresses this challenge. They propose ways to strategically update the model by using modified gradient descent methods. They also analyze this approach, and prove new upper and lower bounds for updating models after data deletion with their new optimization algorithm. </p>



<p>Robust methods for machine learning and statistics aim to provide rigorous guarantees in the presence of outliers or adversarially modified data points. The field of robustness has been steadily growing as researchers uncover more and more models where deviations in the data can lead to unexpected and dramatic changes in model behavior. In ALT 2021, a <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/shen21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a> by Jie Shen and Chicheng Zhang covers learning half-spaces nearly optimally even in the presence of malicious noise.</p>



<p>As a final and thought-provoking direction in trustworthy ML, <a href="https://omereingold.wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Omer Reingold</a> points out that we need to better understand “the meaning of individual probabilities/risk scores,” which are common ways that ML systems summarize or justify decisions. Ideally, the output of a model should be something that people can interpret directly and use to potentially modify their future actions. He elaborates that it is important to think about “the individual quantities (which imply important decisions) that ML is trying to approximate” and to answer “what does fitting the parameters of a model on the entire population imply for individuals and subcommunities?” This question brings to the forefront the fact that ML systems affect both individuals and groups of people, which is an important consideration when formulating rigorous definitions of fairness (e.g., see <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-ethical-algorithm-9780190948207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this book</a> or <a href="https://fairmlbook.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this one</a>).</p>



<p><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong><br />Reinforcement learning (RL) is a framework for interactive learning where an agent interacts with an environment, and the agent’s actions govern the rewards it receives from the environment. Part of the motivation for studying RL is that relevant problems are everywhere. Sometimes the agents are autonomous vehicles. Other times, they are programs playing games like chess or go. People interact more and more with ML models, and hence, living our lives is actually being a part of a multiagent game where we, humans, and the ML models are the agents. “The most exciting direction in learning theory of recent years,” says <a href="https://www.ehazan.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elad Hazan</a>, “is adding rigorous theoretical guarantees to reinforcement learning.” </p>



<p>The RL environment is typically modeled as a <em>Markov decision process (MDP)</em>: a set of states, actions, and transition probabilities that determine the next state and reward given the agent’s current state and action. The agent uses a <em>policy</em> to choose its action from each state with the goal of maximizing its cumulative reward over time. A central challenge is balancing<em> exploration</em> (learning about the environment) and <em>exploitation</em> (spending time choosing actions in states where they can collect high rewards).</p>



<p>In the most basic setting, <em>multi-armed bandits</em>, there is a single state, and each action (or “arm”) leads to a stochastic reward. “Here, the theory is quite mature, though interesting problems remain in connection to the limits of how structure can be exploited,” <a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Csaba Szepesvári</a> says. In two works at ALT, by <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/jourdan21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marc Jourdan, Mojmír Mutný, Johannes Kirschner, and Andreas Krause</a> and by <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/cuvelier21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thibaut Cuvelier, Richard Combes, and Eric Gourdin</a>, the authors show that efficient exploration is possible in a <em>combinatorial semi-bandit </em>setting. Here, the agent can choose an allowed <em>set</em> of arms in each step, and it receives a distinct reward for each chosen arm. While the number of action choices for the agent is larger, this more detailed feedback makes the problem tractable.</p>



<p>Beyond the stateless bandit setting, ML theorists are still figuring out how fast agents can learn how to play optimally in MDPs with <em>finite</em> state spaces and action spaces. Recent progress on this front has given lower bounds on the sample complexity required for agents to learn the best policy. In one ALT <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/domingues21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>, the authors give a unified view of lower bounds for three distinct, but related, problems in RL. The hard MDP instances they construct to show lower bounds are based on hard instances for multi-armed bandit problems.</p>



<p>In the more challenging setting where the state space is infinite, a central question is whether the agent can learn from exploring a finite number of states, and generalize<em> </em>to perform well on unknown areas of the environment. For certain MDPs, generalizing is impossible, but some assumptions on the structure of the MDP may enable generalization. “While algorithm independent problem formulations existed and have been studied in the finite case, a quite recent development is to extend these to the case of ‘large’ environments where the use of <em>function approximation </em>techniques becomes crucial for achieving nontrivial results,” explains Csaba Szepesvári. </p>



<p>Function approximation has to do with the optimal <em>action-value function, </em>which captures the long-term reward of playing a certain action from a given state. This function can sometimes be approximated by some simple class of functions. One of the strongest such assumptions is <em>linear realizability, </em>where the optimal action-value function<em> </em>is a linear function of some representation of the action and state. In one of the <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/weisz21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">papers</a> receiving a best paper award in ALT, Gellert Weisz, Philip Amortila, and Csaba Szepesvári show that even under this strong assumption of linear realizability, the agent needs a number of samples exponential in the length of the episode or the dimension of the representation in order to generalize. Looking forward, the goal is to follow the lead of these papers and better understand the landscape of sample complexity: When can we learn models with a polynomial number of samples, and when is an exponential number necessary?</p>



<p>Nearly every offline learning problem can be studied in an interactive setting, where inputs arrive in an online fashion and need to be processed immediately, which is common in many real-world settings. Models for interactive machine learning provide a framework for studying problems and algorithms in this more challenging setting. Beyond the MDP setting, interactive learning spans online learning (e.g., <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/moshkovitz21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no-substitution</a> <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/bhattacharjee21a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clustering</a>), nonstochastic control theory (e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12178" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">robust controllers for dynamical systems</a>), <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online convex optimization</a>, and many more domains. </p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />We hope this provides a fairly broad view on some of the topics that people are researching right now in learning theory. Of course, there are many more areas that we don’t have space to describe: theory of deep neural networks, quantum algorithms for machine learning problems, human-centered considerations, learning with strategic agents and multiplayer games, convex/nonconvex optimization, federated and distributed learning algorithms, and many more. In general, as Gautam Kamath observes, “A lot of important questions in learning theory arise through interplay between the theoretical and applied machine learning communities.” To have a greater impact, it is important to collaborate with people doing empirical research, and to learn from the front lines about the most interesting phenomena to explain, or the challenges that do not seem surmountable by combining existing tools.</p>



<p>To learn more and to get more involved, we have listed a variety of resources (blogs, workshops, videos, etc.) that can help you get started in this area. As a final motivation for writing this article, we remark that people in the area are keenly aware that we need more young talent to help uncover truth and contribute groundbreaking ideas. As Gautam Kamath puts it, “There are far more interesting questions in learning theory than there are researchers to solve them.”</p>

<p> 1) Trump and other reps have said the following about the Jan 6 event at various times:</p><p>a) The Jan 6 event was freedom fighters who were fighting the noble fight to overturn a fraudulent election. Rah Rah!</p><p>b) The Jan 6 event was a peaceful protest to overturn a fraudulent election. </p><p>c) The Jan 6 event was democrats trying to make republicans look bad.</p><p>d) The Jan 6 event was Antifa. (See <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump/trump-privately-blamed-antifa-people-for-storming-u-s-capitol-axios-idUSKBN29H0DR">here</a>)</p><p>e) Ashli Babbitt (a protestor who was shot by police at the Jan 6 event) should have been honored by flying the flag at half-mast (see <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/trump/trump-reportedly-regrets-not-lowering-american-flag-at-the-white-house-to-honor-ashli-babbitt/">here</a>) </p><p>If we take the intersection of d and e we find that Trump wants to honor a member of Antifa who was shot by police. </p><p>To be fair, Trump is entitled to change his mind. But I wonder- did he ever really think it was Antifa or was that a talking point? If he really thought so then  when did he change his mind? I ask non rhetorically---  NOT a `gotcha question'</p><p>(NOTE: I wrote this post a while back. Since then Trump and some other republicans are tending towards the Freedom Fighters narrative.) </p><p>2) Vaccines:</p><p>a) Some people think that the vaccines are bad to take. I suspect they would give some (incorrect) health reasons, while the real reason may be political. (One reason is that the vaccine make you magnetic. That sounds awesome! Others think that there is a microchip in the vaccine so that Bill Gates can track our movements. Gee, Mark Zuckerberg can already do that. Some thing it will rewrite our DNA. A bio major I know  tells me that such people are confusing messenger RNA with DNA. Great- we can now have a nice conversation and point out where they are wrong.) </p><p>b) Some people think we should NOT give vaccines to poor countries that need them, or to people in prison,  since Americans should have priority. (NOTE- from a purely health-viewpoint this is not correct since a pandemic does not respect boundaries- if there is an outbreak in a diff country or in a prison it will affect people not in those countries and not in prison.) </p><p>Are there people who believe a and b? I ask non-rhetorically. </p><p><br /></p><p>I am not surprised when people hold contradictory thoughts in their heads, but these two cases just struck me as particularly strange. Not sure why.</p><p> </p><p><br /></p></div>

<div class="content">
Over finite fields $F_q$ containing a root of unity of smooth order $n$ (smoothness means $n$ is the product of small primes), the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) leads to the fastest known algebraic algorithms for many basic polynomial operations, such as multiplication, division, interpolation and multi-point evaluation. These operations can be computed by constant fan-in arithmetic circuits over $F_q$ of quasi-linear size; specifically, $O(n \log n)$ for multiplication and division, and $O(n \log^2 n)$ for interpolation and evaluation.

However, the same operations over fields with no smooth order root of unity suffer from an asymptotic slowdown, typically due to the need to introduce “synthetic” roots of unity to enable the FFT. The classical algorithm of Schönhage and Strassen incurred a multiplicative slowdown factor of $\log \log n$ on top of the smooth case. Recent remarkable results of Harvey, van der Hoeven and Lecerf dramatically reduced this multiplicative overhead to $\exp(\log^* (n))$.

We introduce a new approach to fast algorithms for polynomial operations over all large finite fields. The key idea is to replace the group of roots of unity with a set of points $L \subset F_q$ suitably related to a well-chosen elliptic curve group over $F_q$ (the set L itself is not a group). The key advantage of this approach is that elliptic curve groups can be of any size in the Hasse–Weil interval $[q + 1 \pm 2\sqrt{q}]$ and thus can have subgroups of large, smooth order, which an FFT-like divide and conquer algorithm can exploit. Compare this with multiplicative subgroups over $F_q$ whose order must divide $q-1$. By analogy, our method extends the standard, multiplicative FFT in a similar way to how Lenstra’s elliptic curve method extended Pollard’s $p-1$ algorithm for factoring integers.

For polynomials represented by their evaluation over subsets of $L$, we show that  multiplication, division, degree-computation, interpolation, evaluation and Reed–Solomon encoding (also known as low-degree extension) with fixed evaluation points can all be computed with arithmetic circuits of size similar to what is achievable with the classical FFTs when the field size $q$ is special. For several problems, this yields the asymptotically smallest known arithmetic circuits even in the standard monomial representation of polynomials.

The efficiency of the classical FFT follows from using the 2-to-1 squaring map to reduce the evaluation set of roots of unity of order $2^k$ to similar groups of size $2^{k?i}$, $i &gt; 0$. Our algorithms operate similarly, using isogenies of elliptic curves with kernel size 2 as 2-to-1 maps to reduce $L$ of size $2^k$ to sets of size $2^{k?i}$ that are, like $L$, suitably related to elliptic curves, albeit different ones.</div>

<p>There are two reasons for the large number of Good Articles in this set.

So I started nominating more often. And second, the Wikipedia Good Articles editors are having a drive this month to clean out old nominations, as they tend to do a couple of times per year.</p>

<p>
José Altuve hit a game-winning home run in the bottom of the ninth against the Yankees on Sunday. He thereby reproduced the conditions and the outcome of baseball’s most dramatic cheating accusation of 2019.</p>
<p>
Today, at baseball’s All-Star break, we review this and other social experiments that have quite a bit more data.</p>
<p>
Altuve won the 2019 American League Championship series with a pinch-hit homer in the bottom of the ninth against the Yankees’ closer, Aroldis Chapman. As he approached home plate, he was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTNBnk1dz6g">seen</a> telling his teammates waiting to mob him at the plate not to rip off his jersey in celebration. He subsequently <a href="https://youtu.be/-ryvOya4PoE?t=247">scooted</a> into the corridor behind the dugout, then re-emerged into the on-field celebration. This fed accusations that he had been wired with a buzzer to know what kind of pitch was coming from Chapman, in line with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros_sign_stealing_scandal">sign-stealing</a> by other means from the Astros’ 2017 championship season and 2018 that was proven and punished by Major League Baseball. </p>
<p>
Almost the same scenario was reproduced Sunday: Houston down 7-5 against the Yankees with two out and two on base in the ninth, Altuve up against the Yankees’ closer (Chad Green recently supplanting Chapman). Altuve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHrc6OdYOpo">socked</a> a homer to the same part of the ballpark to complete a shocking six-run comeback. Immediately upon touching home, he had his shirt ripped off to reveal nothing but the top half of his birthday suit. This was the most direct way possible to witness that he could have hit the other homer without illegal information.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Examples and Non-Examples </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I have dealt with chess-cheating cases in which electronic buzzing has been specifically alleged, including the two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borislav_Ivanov#Retirement_from_competitive_chess_and_brief_return_to_chess-related_activities">most</a> prominent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/crosswords/chess/a-master-is-disqualified-over-suspicions-of-cheating.html">cases</a> of 2013. I will not take this post further in this direction, however, but rather to pose this question:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> What is considered a “social proof” of an assertion—especially when there are elements of scientific control and reproduction? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
A simple example is a police lineup. This tries to control for whether a witness has previously seen the accused by including the accused among usually four or five similarly represented people. Picking the right person is considered to prove the previous encounter. Statistically, however, this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{p}" class="latex" />-value</a> of only 0.20 or 0.167, which are not considered significant at even the weakest level of “statistical proof.” Allowing <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug04/lineups">null</a> lineups does not change the statistics much.</p>
<p>
Baseball gives a non-example that surprises me. One of the bad performances that cost Chapman his closer role was losing an 8-4 lead against the Los Angeles Angels on June 30. As a fantasy-baseball player, I’ve regularly observed poor pitching (by the closers on my “fantasy team”) when the lead is too large to earn credit for a coveted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)">save</a>. Does the data reproduce a phenomenon of closers bearing down less when way ahead, with no “save” to gain? A <a href="https://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2014/1/27/5344580/the-closer-mentality-part-1-closers-in-non-save-situations">study</a> after the 2013 season, which cleverly represented performances by the same <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{z}" class="latex" />-scores I use in chess, found none. “Meltdowns” like Chapman’s are offset by cases where closers pitched better. The <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{z}" class="latex" />-scores in the study are all in the range -1.25 to +1.50 anyway, which count as statistically random.</p>
<p>
This study used a reasonably large data set, one that is well-defined and admits controlling factors such as normalizing for game circumstances and the quality of the opposing hitters. At least it is more than the two instances of Altuve. In-between would be an attempt to determine whether certain national soccer teams are consistently worse at penalty-kick tiebreaks. England’s and Italy’s teams brought their long tortured histories together in the tiebreak of Sunday’s European Cup final. The Italians missed two of five kicks, a score that often spells doom, but the English missed three.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Larger Scale </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Dick and I are really interested in “experiments” that have spilled into society, with minimal controls but large data. One sphere of this is cybersecurity. </p>
<p>
It seems to us that only in the past decade have security experts begun formalizing their research as experimental science with repeatability and reproducibility as explicit criteria. The NSA devoted a special 2012 <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/70/documents/resources/everyone/digital-media-center/publications/the-next-wave/TNW-19-2.pdf">issue</a> of their <em>Next Wave</em> series to what they titled as “Developing a blueprint for a science of cybersecurity.” Among the contents are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
An introductory essay by Carl Landwehr titled, “Cybersecurity: From engineering to science.” <p></p>
</li><li>
A linchpin <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~ccpalmer/teaching/cs55/Resources/Papers/TNW_19_2_BlueprintScienceCybersecurity_Schneider.pdf">paper</a> by Fred Schneider titled, “Blueprint for a science of cybersecurity.” <p></p>
</li><li>
A <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maxion/pubs/Maxion12.pdf">paper</a> by Roy Maxion titled, “Making experiments dependable,” which came from a 2011 Springer LNCS <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-24541-1">Festschrift</a>.
</li></ul>
<p>
Maxion’s main example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_dynamics">keystroke biometrics</a>. This covers inferences made from typing style on a computer keyboard or mouse or similar handheld input device. This can be used to verify identity or screen for malfeasant activities. Online chess playing platforms collect data of this nature—okay we could not resist adding chess example. </p>
<p>
Another area is experiments designed to simulate attacks and test defenses against them. Schneider’s paper begins with a contrast between <em>predictive</em> modeling versus <em>reactive</em> handling of them. About the latter, he draws an analogy with health care:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Some health problems are best handled in a reactive manner. We know what to do when somebody breaks a finger, and each year we create a new influenza vaccine in anticipation of the flu season to come. But only after making significant investments in basic medical sciences are we starting to understand the mechanisms by which cancers grow, and a cure seems to require that kind of deep understanding.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
He goes on to outline the kind of scientific foundation that could hopefully underlie a ‘cure’ for intrusion and malware and the like. </p>
<p>
What we have seen happen especially in the past months, however—in both health and security—is uncontrolled experiments with society as the domain. Large-scale ransomware attacks are becoming as frequent as hurricanes and heat waves. And of course, the pandemic. These share with Altuve the property of being one-off instances, but have large data on the receiving end.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Summer Pandemic Update </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The following chart updates our June 20 <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/06/20/the-shape-of-this-summer/">post</a> on the state of the pandemic and its projection for the summer—for Florida and the United Kingdom in particular:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/07/13/socially-reproduced-experiments/flukcases071321/" rel="attachment wp-att-18955"><img width="450" alt="" src="https://i2.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/FLUKCases071321.png?resize=450%2C440&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-18955" height="440" /></a></p>
<p>
The vertical line shows about where the charts were on June 20. The past few days are the first where we can point to a significant rise in Florida, though Missouri had a similar rise last week and it is showing up in some other states.  The charts are taken from the <em>Worldometer</em> coronavirus <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">pages</a>. </p>
<p>
The UK rise looks ghastly. It was a subtext of our previous post to worry that allowing the large dense soccer crowds at London’s Wembley Stadium for the semis and final—and anything similar in baseball—would stoke the rise in our respective countries even more. However, the rate of hospitalizations in the UK has remained largely flat. This Fortune <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/07/08/kids-vulnerable-covid-delta-variant-vaccinated-europe/">article</a> last week is one of several attesting that the new cases are mostly in children or in vaccinated people with enough immunity to contain the “breakthrough” positive. The UK is going ahead with large-scale re-openings later this month, with the portion of those 18 and older who have had one dose approaching 90% and those fully vaccinated coming past 70%. The latter number in relation to the whole population is about 52%.</p>
<p>
The US looks like becoming an experiment in how the local vaccination rate affects the numbers. The rates of those fully vaccinated by state are currently eerily <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/08/politics/electoral-map-vaccine-map-covid-19/index.html">similar</a> to Joe Biden’s vote percentage in the state. One aspect of scientific reproducibility is the size of the simplest classifier of the results. For a presidential vote to have simpler explaining power than any factors of biology or other life circumstances would make a strange experiment indeed.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Dick and I tried to come up with other examples—from computer security in particular—to sustain what has been occupying our thoughts about standards of proof for policy. We would welcome some examples from you, our readers. </p>
<p>
And of course, we have been concerned about the present course of the pandemic amid re-openings since the referenced post last month. In the meantime, if it is your taste, please enjoy the All-Star Game, which Altuve is, ironically, <a href="https://calltothepen.com/2021/07/11/houston-astros-officially-skipping-star-game/">skipping</a>.</p>

We give tight bounds on the degree $\ell$  homogenous parts $f_\ell$ of a bounded function $f$ on the cube. We show that if $f: \{\pm 1\}^n \rightarrow [-1,1]$ has degree $d$, then $\| f_\ell \|_\infty$ is bounded by $d^\ell/\ell!$, and $\| \hat{f}_\ell \|_1$ is bounded by $d^\ell e^{{\ell+1 \choose 2}} n^{\frac{\ell-1}{2}}$. We describe applications to pseudorandomness and learning theory. We use similar methods to generalize the classical Pisier's inequality from convex analysis. Our analysis  involves properties of real-rooted polynomials that may be useful elsewhere.</div>

We give a new proof of the fact that the parallel repetition of the (3-player) GHZ game reduces the value of the game to zero polynomially quickly. That is, we show that the value of the $n$-fold GHZ game is at most $n^{-\Omega(1)}$. This was first established by Holmgren and Raz [HR20]. We present a new proof of this theorem that we believe to be simpler and more direct. Unlike most previous works on parallel repetition, our proof makes no use of information theory, and relies on the use of Fourier analysis.

The GHZ game [GHZ89] has played a foundational role in the understanding of quantum information theory, due in part to the fact that quantum strategies can win the GHZ game with probability $1$. It is possible that improved parallel repetition bounds may find applications in this setting.

Recently, Dinur, Harsha, Venkat, and Yuen [DHVY17] highlighted the GHZ game as a simple three-player game, which is in some sense maximally far from the class of multi-player games whose behavior under parallel repetition is well understood. Dinur et al. conjectured that parallel repetition decreases the value of the GHZ game exponentially quickly, and speculated that progress on proving this would shed light on parallel repetition for general multi-player (multi-prover) games.</div>

<p>A basic and frequent task in data analysis is <em>selection</em> – given a set of options \(\mathcal{Y}\), output the (approximately) best one, where “best” is defined by some loss function \(\ell : \mathcal{Y} \times \mathcal{X}^n \to \mathbb{R}\) and a dataset \(x \in \mathcal{X}^n\). That is, we want to output some \(y \in \mathcal{Y}\) that approximately minimizes \(\ell(y,x)\). Naturally, we are interested in <em>private selection</em> – i.e., the output should be differentially private in terms of the dataset \(x\).
This post discusses algorithms for private selection – in particular, we give an improved privacy analysis of the popular exponential mechanism.</p>

<h2 id="the-exponential-mechanism">The Exponential Mechanism</h2>

<p>The most well-known algorithm for private selection is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_mechanism_(differential_privacy)"><em>exponential mechanism</em></a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCS.2007.66" title="Frank McSherry, Kunal Talwar. Mechanism Design via Differential Privacy. FOCS 2007."><strong>[MT07]</strong></a>. The exponential mechanism \(M : \mathcal{X}^n \to \mathcal{Y} \) is a randomized algorithm given by \[\forall x \in \mathcal{X}^n ~ \forall y \in \mathcal{Y} ~~~~~ \mathbb{P}[M(x) = y] = \frac{\exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta} \ell(y,x))}{\sum_{y’ \in \mathcal{Y}} \exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta} \ell(y’,x)) }, \tag{1}\] where \(\Delta\) is the sensitivity of the loss function \(\ell\) given by \[\Delta = \sup_{x,x’ \in \mathcal{X}^n : d(x,x’) \le 1} \max_{y\in\mathcal{Y}} |\ell(y,x) - \ell(y,x’)|,\tag{2}\] where the supremum is taken over all datasets \(x\) and \(x’\) differing on the data of a single individual (which we denote by \(d(x,x’)\le 1\)).</p>

<p>In terms of utility, we can easily show that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02513" title="Raef Bassily, Kobbi Nissim, Adam Smith, Thomas Steinke, Uri Stemmer, Jonathan Ullman. Algorithmic Stability for Adaptive Data Analysis. STOC 2016."><strong>[BNSSSU16]</strong></a> \[\mathbb{E}[\ell(M(x),x)] \le \min_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} \ell(y,x) + \frac{2\Delta}{\varepsilon} \log |\mathcal{Y}|\] for all \(x \in \mathcal{X}^n\) (and we can also give high probability bounds).</p>

<p>It is easy to show that the exponential mechanism satisfies \(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy.
But there is more to this story! We’re going to look at a more refined privacy analysis.</p>

<h2 id="bounded-range">Bounded Range</h2>

<p>The privacy guarantee of the exponential mechanism is more precisely characterized by <em>bounded range</em>. This was observed and defined by David Durfee and Ryan Rogers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04273" title="David Durfee, Ryan Rogers. Practical Differentially Private Top-k Selection with Pay-what-you-get Composition. NeurIPS 2019"><strong>[DR19]</strong></a> and further analyzed later <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13830" title="Jinshuo Dong, David Durfee, Ryan Rogers. Optimal Differential Privacy Composition for Exponential Mechanisms. ICML 2020."><strong>[DDR20]</strong></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Definition 1 (Bounded Range).</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> 
A randomized algorithm \(M : \mathcal{X}^n \to \mathcal{Y}\) satisfies \(\eta\)-bounded range if, for all pairs of inputs \(x, x’ \in \mathcal{X}^n\) differing only on the data of a single individual, there exists some \(t \in \mathbb{R}\) such that \[\forall y \in \mathcal{Y} ~~~~~ \log\left(\frac{\mathbb{P}[M(x)=y]}{\mathbb{P}[M(x’)=y]}\right) \in [t, t+\eta].\] Here \(t\) may depend on the pair of input datasets \(x,x’\), but not on the output \(y\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To interpret this definition, we <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/flavoursofdelta/">recall the definition of the privacy loss random variable</a>: Define \(f : \mathcal{Y} \to \mathbb{R}\) by \[f(y) = \log\left(\frac{\mathbb{P}[M(x)=y]}{\mathbb{P}[M(x’)=y]}\right).\] Then the privacy loss random variable \(Z \gets \mathsf{PrivLoss}(M(x)\|M(x’))\) is given by \(Z = f(M(x))\).</p>

<p>Pure \(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy is equivalent to demanding that the privacy loss is bounded by \(\varepsilon\) – i.e., \(\mathbb{P}[|Z|\le\varepsilon]=1\). Approximate \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-differential privacy is, roughly, equivalent to demanding that \(\mathbb{P}[Z\le\varepsilon]\ge1-\delta\).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Now \(\eta\)-bounded range is simply demanding that the privacy loss \(Z\) is supported on some interval of length \(\eta\). This interval \([t,t+\eta]\) may depend on the pair \(x,x’\).</p>

<p>Bounded range and pure differential privacy are equivalent up to a factor of 2 in the parameters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Lemma 2 (Bounded Range versus Pure Differential Privacy).</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>\(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy implies \(\eta\)-bounded range with \(\eta \le 2\varepsilon\).</li>
    <li>\(\eta\)-bounded range implies \(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy with \(\varepsilon \le \eta\).</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Proof.</em> The first part of the equivalence follows from the fact that pure \(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy implies the privacy loss is supported on the interval \([-\varepsilon,\varepsilon]\). Thus, if we set \(t=-\varepsilon\) and \(\eta=2\varepsilon\), then \([t,t+\eta] = [-\varepsilon,\varepsilon]\).
The second part follows from the fact that the support of the privacy loss \([t,t+\eta]\) must straddle \(0\). That is, the privacy loss cannot be always positive nor always negative, so \(0 \in [t,t+\eta]\) and, hence, \([t,t+\eta] \subseteq [-\eta,\eta]\). Otherwise \(\forall y ~ f(y)&gt;0\) or \(\forall y ~ f(y)&lt;0\)  would imply \(\forall y ~ \mathbb{P}[M(x)=y]&gt;\mathbb{P}[M(x’)=y]\) or \(\forall y ~ \mathbb{P}[M(x)=y]&lt;\mathbb{P}[M(x’)=y]\), contradicting the fact that \(\sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} \mathbb{P}[M(x)=y] = 1\) and \(\sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} \mathbb{P}[M(x’)=y] = 1\). ∎</p>

<p>OK, back to the exponential mechanism:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Lemma 3 (The Exponential Mechanism is Bounded Range).</strong>
The exponential mechanism (given in Equation 1 above) satisfies \(\varepsilon\)-bounded range .<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Proof.</em>
We have \[e^{f(y)} = \frac{\mathbb{P}[M(x)=y]}{\mathbb{P}[M(x’)=y]} = \frac{\exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta}\ell(y,x))}{\exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta}\ell(y,x’))} \cdot \frac{\sum_{y’} \exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta} \ell(y’,x’))}{\sum_{y’} \exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta} \ell(y’,x))}.\]
Setting \(t = \log\left(\frac{\sum_{y’} \exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta} \ell(y’,x’))}{\sum_{y’} \exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta} \ell(y’,x))}\right) - \frac{\varepsilon}{2}\), we have \[ f(y) = \frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta} (\ell(y,x’)-\ell(y,x)+\Delta) + t.\]
By the definition of sensitivity (given in Equation 2), we have \( 0 \le \ell(y,x’)-\ell(y,x)+\Delta \le 2\Delta\), whence \(t \le f(y) \le t + \varepsilon\). ∎</p>

<p>Bounded range is not really a useful privacy definition on its own. Thus we’re going to relate it to a relaxed version of differential privacy next.</p>

<h2 id="concentrated-differential-privacy">Concentrated Differential Privacy</h2>

<p>Concentrated differential privacy <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02065" title="Mark Bun, Thomas Steinke. Concentrated Differential Privacy: Simplifications, Extensions, and Lower Bounds. TCC 2016."><strong>[BS16]</strong></a> and its variants <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01887" title="Cynthia Dwork, Guy N. Rothblum. Concentrated Differential Privacy. 2016."><strong>[DR16]</strong></a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07476" title="Ilya Mironov. Rényi Differential Privacy. CCS 2017."><strong>[M17]</strong></a> are relaxations of pure differential privacy with many nice properties. In particular, it composes very cleanly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Definition 4 (Concentrated Differential Privacy).</strong>
A randomized algorithm \(M : \mathcal{X}^n \to \mathcal{Y}\) satisfies \(\rho\)-concentrated differential privacy if, for all pairs of inputs \(x, x’ \in \mathcal{X}^n\) differing only on the data of a single individual, 
\[\forall \lambda &gt; 0 ~~~~~ \mathbb{E}[\exp( \lambda Z)] \le \exp(\lambda(\lambda+1)\rho),\tag{3}\]
where \(Z \gets \mathsf{PrivLoss}(M(x)\|M(x’))\) is the privacy loss random variable.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Intuitively, concentrated differential privacy requires that the privacy loss is subgaussian. Specifically, the bound on the moment generating function of \(\rho\)-concentrated differential privacy is tight if the privacy loss \(Z\) follows the distribution \(\mathcal{N}(\rho,2\rho)\). Indeed, the privacy loss random variable of the Gaussian mechanism has such a distribution.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>OK, back to the exponential mechanism:
We know that \(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy implies \(\frac12 \varepsilon^2\)-concentrated differential privacy <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02065" title="Mark Bun, Thomas Steinke. Concentrated Differential Privacy: Simplifications, Extensions, and Lower Bounds. TCC 2016."><strong>[BS16]</strong></a>.
This, of course, applies to the exponential mechaism. A cool fact – that we want to draw more attention to – is that we can do better! 
Specifically, \(\eta\)-bounded range implies \(\frac18 \eta^2\)-concentrated differential privacy <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07223" title="Mark Cesar, Ryan Rogers. Bounding, Concentrating, and Truncating: Unifying Privacy Loss Composition for Data Analytics. ALT 2021."><strong>[CR21]</strong></a>.
What follows is a proof of this fact following that of Mark Cesar and Ryan Rogers, but with some simplification.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 5 (Bounded Range implies Concentrated Differential Privacy).</strong>
If \(M\) is \(\eta\)-bounded range, then it is \(\frac18\eta^2\)-concentrated differentially private.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Proof.</em>
Fix datasets \(x,x’ \in \mathcal{X}^n\) differing on a single individual’s data.
Let \(Z \gets \mathsf{PrivLoss}(M(x)\|M(x’))\) be the privacy loss random variable of the mechanism \(M\) on this pair of datasets.
By the definition of bounded range (Definition 1), there exists some \(t \in \mathbb{R}\) such that \(Z \in [t, t+\eta]\) with probability 1.
Now we employ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoeffding%27s_lemma">Hoeffding’s Lemma</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080%2F01621459.1963.10500830" title="Wassily Hoeffding. Probability inequalities for sums of bounded random variables. JASA 1963."><strong>[H63]</strong></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Lemma 6 (Hoeffding’s Lemma).</strong>
Let \(X\) be a random variable supported on the interval \([a,b]\). Then, for all \(\lambda \in \mathbb{R}\), we have \[\mathbb{E}[\exp(\lambda X)] \le \exp \left( \mathbb{E}[X] \cdot \lambda + \frac{(b-a)^2}{8} \cdot \lambda^2 \right).\]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Applying the lemma to the privacy loss gives \[\forall \lambda \in \mathbb{R} ~~~~~  \mathbb{E}[\exp(\lambda Z)] \le \exp \left( \mathbb{E}[Z] \cdot \lambda + \frac{\eta^2}{8} \cdot \lambda^2 \right).\]
The only remaining thing we need is to show is that \(\mathbb{E}[Z] \le \frac18 \eta^2\).<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>If we set \(\lambda = -1 \), then we get \( \mathbb{E}[\exp( - Z)] \le \exp \left( -\mathbb{E}[Z] + \frac{\eta^2}{8} \right)\), which rearranges to \(\mathbb{E}[Z] \le \frac18 \eta^2 - \log \mathbb{E}[\exp( - Z)]\). 
Now we have \[ \mathbb{E}[\exp( - Z)] \!=\! \sum_y \mathbb{P}[M(x)\!=\!y] \exp(-f(y)) \!=\! \sum_y \mathbb{P}[M(x)\!=\!y]  \!\cdot\! \frac{\mathbb{P}[M(x’)\!=\!y]}{\mathbb{P}[M(x)\!=\!y]} \!=\! 1.\]
∎</p>

<p>This brings us to the TL;DR of this post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Corollary 7.</strong> The exponential mechanism (given by Equation 1) is \(\frac18 \varepsilon^2\)-concentrated differentially private.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is great news. The standard analysis only gives \(\frac12 \varepsilon^2\)-concentrated differential privacy. Constants matter when applying differential privacy, and we save a factor of 4 in the concentrated differential privacy analysis of the exponential mechanism for free with this improved analysis.</p>

<p>Combining Lemma 2 with Theorem 5 also gives a simpler proof of the conversion from pure differential privacy to concentrated differential privacy <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02065" title="Mark Bun, Thomas Steinke. Concentrated Differential Privacy: Simplifications, Extensions, and Lower Bounds. TCC 2016."><strong>[BS16]</strong></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Corollary 8.</strong> \(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy implies \(\frac12 \varepsilon^2\)-concentrated differential privacy.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-the-exponential-mechanism">Beyond the Exponential Mechanism</h2>

<p>The exponential mechanism is not the only algorithm for private selection. A closely-related algorithm is <em>report noisy max/min</em>:<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> Draw independent noise \(\xi_y\) from some distribution for each \(y \in \mathcal{Y}\) then output \[M(x) = \underset{y \in \mathcal{Y}}{\mathrm{argmin}} ~ \ell(y,x) - \xi_y.\]</p>

<p>If the noise distribution is an appropriate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumbel_distribution">Gumbel distribution</a>, then report noisy max is exactly the exponential mechanism. (This equivalence is known as the “Gumbel max trick.”)</p>

<p>We can also use the Laplace distribution or the exponential distribution. Report noisy max with the exponential distribution is equivalent to the <em>permute and flip</em> algorithm <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12603" title="Ryan McKenna, Daniel Sheldon. Permute-and-Flip: A new mechanism for differentially private selection . NeurIPS 2020."><strong>[MS20]</strong></a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07260" title="Zeyu Ding, Daniel Kifer, Sayed M.

The Permute-and-Flip Mechanism is Identical to Report-Noisy-Max with Exponential Noise. 2021."><strong>[DKSSWXZ21]</strong></a>. However, these algorithms don’t enjoy the same improved bounded range and concentrated differential privacy guarantees as the exponential mechanism.</p>

<p>There are also other variants of the selection problem. For example, in some cases we can assume that only a few options have low loss and the rest of the options have high loss – i.e., there is a gap between the minimum loss and the second-lowest loss (or, more generally, the \(k\)-th lowest loss). In this case there are algorithms that attain better accuracy than the exponential mechanism under relaxed privacy definitions <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2177" title="Kamalika Chaudhuri, Daniel Hsu, Shuang Song.

We present a Karchmer-Wigderson game to study the complexity of hazard-free formulas. This new game is both a generalization of the monotone Karchmer-Wigderson game and an analog of the classical Boolean Karchmer-Wigderson game. Therefore, it acts as a bridge between the existing monotone and general games.

Using this game, we prove hazard-free formula size and depth lower bounds that are provably stronger than those possible by the standard technique of transferring results from monotone complexity in a black-box fashion.
For the multiplexer function
we give (1) a hazard-free formula of optimal size and (2) an improved low-depth hazard-free formula of almost optimal size and (3) a hazard-free formula with alternation depth $2$ that has optimal depth.
We then use our optimal constructions to obtain an improved universal worst-case hazard-free formula size upper bound.
We see our results as a significant step towards establishing hazard-free computation as an independent missing link between Boolean complexity and monotone complexity.</div>

High-dimensional expanders generalize the notion of expander graphs to higher-dimensional simplicial complexes. In contrast to expander graphs, only a handful of high-dimensional expander constructions have been proposed, and no elementary combinatorial construction with near-optimal expansion is known. In this paper, we introduce an improved combinatorial high-dimensional expander construction, by modifying a previous construction of Liu, Mohanty, and Yang (ITCS 2020), which is based on a high-dimensional variant of a tensor product. Our construction achieves a spectral gap of $\Omega(\frac{1}{k^2})$ for random walks on the $k$-dimensional faces, which is only quadratically worse than the optimal bound of $\Theta(\frac{1}{k})$. Previous combinatorial constructions, including that of Liu, Mohanty, and Yang, only achieved a spectral gap that is exponentially small in $k$. We also present reasoning that suggests our construction is optimal among similar product-based constructions.</div>

Nisan and Szegedy (CC 1994) showed that any Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ that depends on all its input variables, when represented as a real-valued multivariate polynomial $P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$, has degree at least $\log n - O(\log \log n)$. This was improved to a tight $(\log n - O(1))$ bound by Chiarelli, Hatami and Saks (Combinatorica 2020). Similar statements are also known for other Boolean function complexity measures such as Sensitivity (Simon (FCT 1983)), Quantum query complexity, and Approximate degree (Ambainis and de Wolf (CC 2014)). 

In this paper, we address this question for \emph{Probabilistic degree}. The function $f$ has probabilistic degree at most $d$ if there is a random real-valued polynomial of degree at most $d$ that agrees with $f$ at each input with high probability. Our understanding of this complexity measure is significantly weaker than those above: for instance, we do not even know the probabilistic degree of the OR function, the best-known bounds put it between $(\log n)^{1/2-o(1)}$ and $O(\log n)$ (Beigel, Reingold, Spielman (STOC 1991); Tarui (TCS 1993); Harsha, Srinivasan (RSA 2019)).

Here we can give a near-optimal understanding of the probabilistic degree of $n$-variate functions $f$, \emph{modulo} our lack of understanding of the probabilistic degree of OR. We show that if the probabilistic degree of OR is $(\log n)^c$, then the minimum possible probabilistic degree of such an $f$ is at least $(\log n)^{c/(c+1)-o(1)}$, and we show this is tight up to $(\log n)^{o(1)}$ factors.</div>

<div class="content">
<p>Piecewise-circular curves or, if you like, arc-polygons are a very old topic in mathematics. Archimedes and Pappus studied the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbelos">arbelos</a>, a curved triangle formed from three semicircles, and Hippocrates of Chios found that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lune_of_Hippocrates">lune of Hippocrates</a>, a two-sided figure bounded by a semicircle and a quarter-circle, has the same area as an isosceles right triangle stretched between the same two points. The history of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuleaux_triangle">Reuleaux triangle</a>, bounded by three sixths of circles, stretches back well past Reuleaux to the shapes of of Gothic church windows and its use by Leonardo da Vinci for fortress floor plans and world map projections. But despite their long history and frequent use (for instance in the design of machined parts), there are some basic properties of arc-polygons that seem to have been unexplored so far.</p>

<p>I looked at one of these properties, <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/05/09/arc-triangle-tilings.html">the ability of arc-triangles to tile the plane</a>, in an earlier post. Another of these properties involves the feasible combinations of angles of these shapes. As is well known, in a straight-sided triangle in the plane, the three interior angles always sum to exactly \(\pi\), and any three positive angles summing to \(\pi\) are possible. Let \(T\) be the set of triples of angles \((\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3)\) from triangles, and reinterpret these triples as coordinates of points in Euclidean space. Then \(T\) is itself an equilateral triangle, with corners at the three points \((\pi,0,0)\), \((0,\pi,0)\), and \((0,0\pi)\). (More precisely, it’s the relative interior of this triangle.)</p>

<p>What about arc-triangles? Are their angles similarly constrained? What shape do their triples of angles make? First of all, their angles don’t have a fixed sum (except for the tilers, for which this sum is again \(\pi\)). The arbelos has three interior angles that are all zero, summing to zero. The Reuleux triangle has three angles of \(2\pi/3\), summing to \(2\pi\). <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/05/15/linkage.html">Boscovitch’s cardioid</a>, below, uses three semicircles like the arbelos, but with one interior angle of \(2\pi\) and two others equal to \(\pi\), summing to \(4\pi\). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trefoil">trefoil</a>, a common architectural motif, bulges outward from its three corners, forming interior angles that are much larger, up to \(2\pi\) each for a trefoil made from three \(5/6\)-circle arcs, for a total interior angle of \(6\pi\).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/boscovich.svg" alt="Boscovich's cardioid" /></p>

<p>Nevertheless, for a non-self-crossing arc-triangle, not all combinations of angles are possible. For instance, it’s not possible to have one angle that is zero and two that are \(2\pi\). My new preprint, “Angles of arc-polygons and lombardi drawings of cacti” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03615">arXiv:2107.03615
</a>, with UCI students Daniel Frishberg and Martha Osegueda, to appear at CCCG) proves a precise characterization: beyond the obvious requirement that each angle \(\theta_i\) be in the range \(0\le\theta_i\le 2\pi\), we have only the additional inequalities</p>

\[-\pi &lt; \frac{\pi - \theta_i + \theta_{i+1} - \theta_{i+2}}{2} &lt; \pi\]

<p>where the index arithmetic is done modulo three. The formula in the middle of each of these inequalities is itself an angle, the angle of incidence between one of the circular arcs of the arc-triangle and the circle through its three corners. Where the straight triangles had an equilateral-triangle feasible region, the arc-triangles have a more complicated shape. The obvious constraints \(0\le\theta_i\le 2\pi\) would produce a cubical feasible region \([0,2\pi]^3\), but the additional inequalities above cut off six corners of the cube, leaving a feasible region looking like this:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/feasible-arc-triangles.svg" alt="The feasible region for triples of angles of arc-triangles" /></p>

<p>The motivating application for all of this is graph drawing, and more specifically Lombardi drawing, in which edges are circular arcs meeting at equal angles at each vertex. Using our new understanding of arc-polygons, we prove that every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cactus_graph">cactus graph</a> has a planar Lombardi drawing for its natural embedding (the one in which each cycle of the cactus forms a face) but might not for some other embeddings, including the one below.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/badhat.svg" alt="An embedded cactus that has no planar Lombardi drawing" /></p>

<p>But beyond graph drawing, I think that the long history and many applications of arc-polygons justifies more study of their general properties. For instance, what about arc-polygons with more than three sides? What can their angles be? Our paper has a partial answer, enough to answer the questions we asked in our Lombardi drawing application, but a complete characterization for arc-polygons of more than three sides is still open.</p>

We show that the number of variables and the quantifier depth needed to distinguish a pair of graphs by first-order logic sentences exactly match the complexity measures of clause width and positive depth needed to refute the corresponding graph isomorphism formula in propositional narrow resolution. 

Using this connection, we obtain upper and lower bounds for refuting graph  isomorphism formulas in (normal) resolution. In particular, we show that if $k$ is the minimum number of variables needed to distinguish two graphs with $n$ vertices each, then there is an $n^{\mathrm{O}(k)}$ resolution refutation size upper bound for the corresponding isomorphism formula, as well as lower bounds of $2^{k-1}$ and $k$ for the tree-like resolution size and resolution clause space for this formula. We also show a resolution size lower bound of ${\exp} \big( \Omega(k^2/n) \big)$ for the case of colored graphs with constant color class size.

Applying these results, we prove the first exponential lower bound for graph isomorphism formulas in the proof system SRC-1, a system that extends resolution with a global symmetry rule, thereby answering an open question posed by Schweitzer and Seebach.</div>

<h3><a class="entryheader" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/07/09/spanners-unit-ball.html">Spanners for unit ball graphs in doubling spaces</a></h3>

<p>My student Hadi Khodabandeh had a paper with me on spanners earlier this year at SoCG, in which we showed that <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/02/17/spanners-have-sparse.html">the greedy spanner algorithm for points in the Euclidean plane produces graphs with few crossings and small separators</a>. Now we have another spanner preprint: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15234">“Optimal spanners for unit ball graphs in doubling metrics”, arXiv:2106.15234</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubling_space">Doubling metrics</a> are a generalization of Euclidean spaces. Like Euclidean spaces, they have a dimension, the <em>doubling dimension</em>, but it might not be an integer. Even the doubling dimension of the Euclidean plane itself is \(\log_2 7\approx 2.807355\); this means that every circular disk of radius \(r\) in the plane can be covered by seven closed disks of radius \(r/2\).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/doubling-dim.svg" alt="Seven disks of radius $$r/2$$ cover a single disk of radius $$r$$" /></p>

<p>Analogously, the <em>doubling constant</em> of a metric space (if it exists) is the smallest number \(c\) such that every closed metric ball (the set of points within some radius \(r\) of a fixed point) can be covered by \(c\) balls of half the radius. The <em>doubling dimension</em> is the binary logarithm of the doubling constant. A metric space is a <em>doubling metric</em> or <em>doubling space</em> if it has a doubling constant and doubling dimension. This is true for all Euclidean spaces: for instance, if you cover a ball with a grid of hypercubes, sized small enough that their long diagonal has length at most the radius of the ball, you obtain doubling constant at most \(\lceil 2\sqrt{d}\rceil^d\), although it seems difficult to compute the precise doubling constant in general.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/grid-doubling.svg" alt="Nine disks of radius $$r/2$$ cover a square grid that covers a single disk of radius $$r$$" /></p>

<p>The hyperbolic plane provides a natural example of a space that is not a doubling space: arbitrarily large-radius disks require arbitrarily many half-radius disks to cover them.</p>

<p>Many results in computational geometry can be generalized to doubling metrics, but not always, and sometimes with difficulty. That includes results on spanners, as we consider in our paper. A spanner of a weighted graph is a subgraph whose shortest path distances approximate the distances in the full graph, and often for spanners of metric spaces one uses the complete graph, weighted by the metric distance between each pair of points. But here, we are using a different graph, the unit ball graph. The unit ball graph, for points in a continuous space, has an edge whenever two unit balls centered at two of the points have a nonempty intersection, and it can be extended to discrete point sets by instead including an edge whenever two points are at distance at most 2 (or, as in our paper, distance at most 1; scaling doesn’t really change anything). The weights are the same as in the complete graph. If a spanner accurately approximates all edge weights, it approximates all paths.</p>

<p>The unit ball graph has fewer edges to approximate than the complete graph. But that actually makes it harder to approximate, because by the same token there are fewer edges that can be used in the spanner. Despite that, the greedy spanner algorithm still produces a spanner, but one of its key properties is lost when going from Euclidean to doubling spaces: Euclidean greedy spanners have bounded degree, but greedy spanners in doubling spaces do not. Instead, our paper provides different spanner algorithms that apply to unit ball graphs, approximate paths in these graphs arbitrarily well, have bounded degree, have total weight a constant times that of the minimum spanning tree, and can be constructed efficiently in a distributed model of computing. I think the details are too technical to go into here, so see the paper for more.</p>

<div class="content">
A card guessing game is played between two players, Guesser and Dealer. At the beginning of the game, the Dealer holds a deck of $n$ cards (labeled $1, ..., n$). For $n$ turns, the Dealer draws a card from the deck, the Guesser guesses which card was drawn, and then the card is discarded from the deck. The Guesser receives a point for each correctly guessed card. 

With perfect memory, a Guesser can keep track of all cards that were played so far and pick at random a card that has not appeared so far, yielding in expectation $\ln n$ correct guesses. With no memory, the best a Guesser can do will result in a single guess in expectation. 

We consider the case of a memory bounded Guesser that has $m &lt; n$ memory bits. We show that the performance of such a memory bounded Guesser depends much on the behavior of the Dealer. In more detail, we show that there is a gap between the static case, where the Dealer draws cards from a properly shuffled deck or a prearranged one, and the adaptive case, where the Dealer draws cards thoughtfully, in an adversarial manner. Specifically: 

1. We show a Guesser with $O(\log^2 n)$ memory bits that scores a near optimal result against any static Dealer. 

2. We show that no Guesser with $m$ bits of memory can score better than $O(\sqrt{m})$ correct guesses, thus, no Guesser can score better than $\min \{\sqrt{m}, \ln n\}$, i.e., the above Guesser is optimal. 

3. We show an efficient adaptive Dealer against which no Guesser with $m$ memory bits can make more than $\ln m + 2 \ln \log n + O(1)$ correct guesses in expectation. 

These results are (almost) tight, and we prove them using compression arguments that harness the guessing strategy for encoding.</div>

<p>In effort to understand implicit regularization in deep learning, a lot of theoretical focus is being directed at matrix factorization, which can be seen as linear neural networks.
This post is based on our <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09972.pdf">recent paper</a> (to appear at ICML 2021), where we take a step towards practical deep learning, by investigating <em>tensor factorization</em> — a model equivalent to a certain type of non-linear neural networks.
It is well known that <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.1393.pdf">most tensor problems are NP-hard</a>, and accordingly, the common sentiment is that working with tensors (in both theory and practice) entails extreme difficulties.
However, by adopting a dynamical systems view, we manage to avoid such difficulties, and establish an implicit regularization towards low <em>tensor rank</em>.
Our results suggest that tensor rank may shed light on generalization in deep learning.</p>

<h2 id="challenge-finding-a-right-measure-of-complexity">Challenge: finding a right measure of complexity</h2>

<p>Overparameterized neural networks are mysteriously able to generalize even when trained without any explicit regularization.
Per conventional wisdom, this generalization stems from an <em>implicit regularization</em> — a tendency of gradient-based optimization to fit training examples with predictors of minimal ‘‘complexity.’’
A major challenge in translating this intuition to provable guarantees is that we lack measures for predictor complexity that are quantitative (admit generalization bounds), and at the same time, capture the essence of natural data (images, audio, text etc.), in the sense that it can be fit with predictors of low complexity.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/reg_tf/imp_reg_tf_data_complexity.png" style="width: 500px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 5px;" />
<br />
<i><b>Figure 1:</b> 
To explain generalization in deep learning, a complexity <br />
measure must allow the fit of natural data with low complexity. On the <br />
other hand, when fitting data which does not admit generalization, <br />
e.g. random data, the complexity should be high. 
</i>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="a-common-testbed-matrix-factorization">A common testbed: matrix factorization</h2>

<p>Without a clear complexity measure for practical neural networks, existing analyses usually focus on simple settings where a notion of complexity is obvious. 
A common example of such a setting is <em>matrix factorization</em> — matrix completion via linear neural networks. 
This model was discussed pretty extensively in previous posts (see <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2019/06/03/trajectories/">one</a> by Sanjeev, <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2019/07/10/trajectories-linear-nets/">one</a> by Nadav and Wei and <a href="https://www.offconvex.org/2020/11/27/reg_dl_not_norm/">another one</a> by Nadav), but for completeness we present it again here.</p>

<p>In <em>matrix completion</em> we’re given a subset of entries from an unknown matrix $W^* \in \mathbb{R}^{d, d’}$, and our goal is to predict the unobserved entries. 
This can be viewed as a supervised learning problem with $2$-dimensional inputs, where the label of the input $( i , j )$ is $( W^* )_{i,j}$.
Under such a viewpoint, the observed entries are the training set, and the average reconstruction error over unobserved entries is the test error, quantifying generalization.
A predictor can then be thought of as a matrix, and a natural notion of complexity is its <em>rank</em>.
Indeed, in many real-world scenarios (a famous example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize">Netflix Prize</a>) one is interested in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.06422.pdf">recovering a low rank matrix from incomplete observations</a>.</p>

<p>A ‘‘deep learning approach’’ to matrix completion is matrix factorization, where the idea is to use a linear neural network (fully connected neural network with no non-linearity), and fit observations via gradient descent (GD). 
This amounts to optimizing the following objective:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
\[
 \min\nolimits_{W_1 , \ldots , W_L} ~ \sum\nolimits_{(i,j) \in observations} \big[ ( W_L \cdots W_1 )_{i , j} - (W^*)_{i,j} \big]^2 ~.
\]
</div>

<p>It is obviously possible to constrain the rank of the produced solution by limiting the shared dimensions of the weight matrices $\{ W_j \}_j$. 
However, from an implicit regularization standpoint, the most interesting case is where rank is unconstrained and the factorization can express any matrix. 
In this case there is no explicit regularization, and the kind of solution we get is determined implicitly by the parameterization and the optimization algorithm.</p>

<p>As it turns out, in practice, matrix factorization with near-zero initialization and small step size tends to accurately recover low rank matrices.
This phenomenon (first identified in <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/file/58191d2a914c6dae66371c9dcdc91b41-Paper.pdf">Gunasekar et al. 2017</a>) manifests some kind of implicit regularization, whose mathematical characterization drew a lot of interest.
It was initially conjectured that matrix factorization implicitly minimizes nuclear norm (<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/file/58191d2a914c6dae66371c9dcdc91b41-Paper.pdf">Gunasekar et al. 2017</a>), but recent evidence points to implicit rank minimization, stemming from incremental learning dynamics (see <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/file/c0c783b5fc0d7d808f1d14a6e9c8280d-Paper.pdf">Arora et al. 2019</a>; <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/file/f21e255f89e0f258accbe4e984eef486-Paper.pdf">Razin &amp; Cohen 2020</a>; <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf/e29b53584bc9017cb15b9394735cd51b56c32446.pdf">Li et al. 2021</a>). 
Today, it seems we have a relatively firm understanding of generalization in matrix factorization.
There is a complexity measure for predictors — matrix rank — by which implicit regularization strives to lower complexity, and the data itself is of low complexity (i.e. can be fit with low complexity). 
Jointly, these two conditions lead to generalization.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-matrix-factorization-tensor-factorization">Beyond matrix factorization: tensor factorization</h2>

<p>Matrix factorization is interesting on its own behalf, but as a theoretical surrogate for deep learning it is limited.
First, it corresponds to <em>linear</em> neural networks, and thus misses the crucial aspect of non-linearity. 
Second, viewing matrix completion as a prediction problem, it doesn’t capture tasks with more than two input variables.
As we now discuss, both of these limitations can be lifted if instead of matrices one considers tensors.</p>

<p>A tensor can be thought of as a multi-dimensional array.
The number of axes in a tensor is called its <em>order</em>.
In the task of <em>tensor completion</em>, a subset of entries from an unknown tensor $\mathcal{W}^* \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1, \ldots, d_N}$ are given, and the goal is to predict the unobserved entries. 
Analogously to how matrix completion can be viewed as a prediction problem over two input variables, order-$N$ tensor completion can be seen as a prediction problem over $N$ input variables (each corresponding to a different axis).
In fact, any multi-dimensional prediction task with discrete inputs and scalar output can be formulated as a tensor completion problem.
Consider for example the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database">MNIST dataset</a>, and for simplicity assume that image pixels hold one of two values, i.e. are either black or white. 
The task of predicting labels for the $28$-by-$28$ binary images can be seen as an order-$784$ (one axis for each pixel) tensor completion problem, where all axes are of length $2$ (corresponding to the number of values a pixel can take). 
For further details on how general prediction tasks map to tensor completion problems see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09972.pdf">our paper</a>.</p>

<br />
<i><b>Figure 2:</b> 
Prediction tasks can be viewed as tensor completion problems. <br />
For example, predicting labels for input images with $3$ pixels, each taking <br />
one of $5$ grayscale values, corresponds to completing a $5 \times 5 \times 5$ tensor.
</i>
</div>
<p><br />
Like matrices, tensors can be factorized. 
The most basic scheme for factorizing tensors, named CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP), parameterizes a tensor as a sum of outer products (for information on this scheme, as well as others, see the <a href="http://www.kolda.net/publication/TensorReview.pdf">excellent survey</a> of Kolda and Bader).
In <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09972.pdf">our paper</a> and this post, we use the term <em>tensor factorization</em> to refer to solving tensor completion by fitting observations via GD over CP parameterization, i.e. over the following objective ($\otimes$ here stands for outer product):</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
\[
\min\nolimits_{ \{ \mathbf{w}_r^n \}_{r , n} } \sum\nolimits_{ (i_1 , ... , i_N) \in observations } \big[ \big(  {\textstyle \sum}_{r = 1}^R \mathbf{w}_r^1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{w}_r^N \big)_{i_1 , \ldots , i_N} - (\mathcal{W}^*)_{i_1 , \ldots , i_N} \big]^2 ~.
\]
</div>

<p>The concept of rank naturally extends from matrices to tensors.
The <em>tensor rank</em> of a given tensor $\mathcal{W}$ is defined to be the minimal number of components (i.e. of outer product summands) $R$ required for CP parameterization to express it.
Note that for order-$2$ tensors, i.e. for matrices, this exactly coincides with matrix rank.
We can explicitly constrain the tensor rank of solutions found by tensor factorization via limiting the number of components $R$. 
However, since our interest lies on implicit regularization, we consider the case where $R$ is large enough for any tensor to be expressed.</p>

<p>By now you might be wondering what does tensor factorization have to do with deep learning.
Apparently, as Nadav mentioned in an <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2020/11/27/reg_dl_not_norm/">earlier post</a>, analogously to how matrix factorization is equivalent to matrix completion (two-dimensional prediction) via linear neural networks, tensor factorization is equivalent to tensor completion (multi-dimensional prediction) with a certain type of <em>non-linear</em> neural networks (for the exact details behind the latter equivalence see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09972.pdf">our paper</a>). 
It therefore represents a setting one step closer to practical neural networks.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/reg_tf/mf_lnn_tf_nonlinear.png" style="width: 900px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 5px;" />
<br />
<i><b>Figure 3:</b> 
While matrix factorization corresponds to a linear neural network, <br />
tensor factorization corresponds to a certain non-linear neural network.
</i>
</div>
<p><br />
As a final piece of the analogy between matrix and tensor factorizations, in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06398.pdf">previous paper</a> (described in an <a href="https://www.offconvex.org/2020/11/27/reg_dl_not_norm/">earlier post</a>) Noam and Nadav demonstrated empirically that (similarly to the phenomenon discussed above for matrices) tensor factorization with near-zero initialization and small step size tends to accurately recover low rank tensors.
Our goal in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09972.pdf">current paper</a> was to mathematically explain this finding. 
To avoid the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.1393.pdf">notorious difficulty of tensor problems</a>, we chose to adopt a dynamical systems view, and analyze directly the trajectories induced by GD.</p>

<h2 id="dynamical-analysis-implicit-tensor-rank-minimization">Dynamical analysis: implicit tensor rank minimization</h2>

<p>So what can we say about the implicit regularization in tensor factorization? 
At the core of our analysis is the following dynamical characterization of component norms:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem:</strong>
Running gradient flow (GD with infinitesimal step size) over a tensor factorization with near-zero initialization leads component norms to evolve by:
[ \frac{d}{dt} || \mathbf{w}_r^1 (t) \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{w}_r^N (t) || \propto \color{brown}{|| \mathbf{w}_r^1 (t) \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{w}_r^N (t) ||^{2 - 2/N}} ~,
]
where $\mathbf{w}_r^1 (t), \ldots, \mathbf{w}_r^N (t)$ denote the weight vectors at time $t \geq 0$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the theorem above, component norms evolve at a rate proportional to their size exponentiated by $\color{brown}{2 - 2 / N}$ (recall that $N$ is the order of the tensor to complete).
Consequently, they are subject to a momentum-like effect, by which they move slower when small and faster when large. 
This suggests that when initialized near zero, components tend to remain close to the origin, and then, after passing a critical threshold, quickly grow until convergence. 
Intuitively, these dynamics induce an incremental process where components are learned one after the other, leading to solutions with a few large components and many small ones, i.e. to (approximately) low tensor rank solutions!</p>

<p>We empirically verified the incremental learning of components in many settings. 
Here is a representative example from one of our experiments (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09972.pdf">the paper</a> for more):</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/reg_tf/tf_dyn_exps.png" style="width: 800px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 10px;" />
<br />
<i><b>Figure 4:</b>

An incremental learning effect is enhanced as initialization scale decreases, <br />
leading to accurate completion of a low rank tensor.
</i>
</div>
<p><br />
Using our dynamical characterization of component norms, we were able to prove that with sufficiently small initialization, tensor factorization (approximately) follows a trajectory of rank one tensors for an arbitrary amount of time. 
This leads to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem:</strong>
If tensor completion has a rank one solution, then under certain technical conditions, tensor factorization will reach it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s worth mentioning that, in a way, our results extend to tensor factorization the incremental rank learning dynamics known for matrix factorization (cf. <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/file/c0c783b5fc0d7d808f1d14a6e9c8280d-Paper.pdf">Arora et al. 2019</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09839v1.pdf">Li et al. 2021</a>). 
As typical when transitioning from matrices to tensors, this extension entailed various challenges that necessitated use of different techniques.</p>

<h2 id="tensor-rank-as-measure-of-complexity">Tensor rank as measure of complexity</h2>

<p>Going back to the beginning of the post, recall that a major challenge towards understanding implicit regularization in deep learning is that we lack measures for predictor complexity that capture natural data. 
Now, let us recap what we have seen thus far:
$(1)$ tensor completion is equivalent to multi-dimensional prediction; 
$(2)$ tensor factorization corresponds to solving the prediction task with certain non-linear neural networks; 
and 
$(3)$ the implicit regularization of these non-linear networks, i.e. of tensor factorization, minimizes tensor rank.
Motivated by these findings, we ask the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question:</strong> 
Can tensor rank serve as a measure of predictor complexity?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We empirically explored this prospect by evaluating the extent to which tensor rank captures natural data, i.e. to which natural data can be fit with predictors of low tensor rank.
As testbeds we used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database">MNIST</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist">Fashion-MNIST</a> datasets, comparing the resulting errors against those obtained when fitting two randomized variants: one generated via shuffling labels (‘‘rand label’’), and the other by replacing inputs with noise (‘‘rand image’’).</p>

<p>The following plot, displaying results for Fashion-MNIST (those for MNIST are similar), shows that with predictors of low tensor rank the original data is fit way more accurately than the randomized datasets. 
Specifically, even with tensor rank as low as one the original data is fit relatively well, while the error in fitting random data is close to trivial (variance of the label). 
This suggests that tensor rank as a measure of predictor complexity has potential to capture aspects of natural data! 
Note also that an accurate fit with low tensor rank coincides with low test error, which is not surprising given that low tensor rank predictors can be described with a small number of parameters.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/reg_tf/exp_complexity_fmnist.png" style="width: 600px; padding-bottom: 15px; padding-top: 10px;" />
<br />
<i><b>Figure 5:</b> 
Evaluation of tensor rank as a measure of complexity — standard datasets <br />
can be fit accurately with predictors of low tensor rank (far beneath what is required by <br />
random datasets), suggesting it may capture aspects of natural data. Plot shows mean <br />
error of predictors with low tensor rank over Fashion-MNIST. Markers correspond <br />
to separate runs differing in the explicit constraint on the tensor rank.

<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding thoughts</h2>

<p>Overall, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09972.pdf">our paper</a> shows that tensor rank captures both the implicit regularization of a certain type of non-linear neural networks, and aspects of natural data. 
In light of this, we believe tensor rank (or more advanced notions such as hierarchical tensor rank) might pave way to explaining both implicit regularization in more practical neural networks, and the properties of real-world data translating this implicit regularization to generalization.</p>

<p>Releasing large sets of statistical queries is a centerpiece of the theory of differential privacy.  Here, we are given a <em>dataset</em> \(x = (x_1,\dots,x_n) \in [T]^n\), and a set of <em>statistical queries</em> \(f_1,\dots,f_k\), where each query is defined by some bounded function \(f_j : [T] \to [-1,1]\), and (abusing notation) is defined as
\[
f_j(x) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f_j(x_i).
\]
We use \(f(x) = (f_1(x),\dots,f_k(x))\) to denote the vector consisting of the true answers to all these queries.
Our goal is to design an \((\varepsilon, \delta)\)-differentially private algorithm \(M\) that takes a dataset \(x\in [T]^n\) and outputs a random vector \(M(x)\in \mathbb{R}^k\) such that \(\| M(x) - f(x) \|\) is small in expectation for some norm \(\|\cdot\|\). Usually algorithms for this problem also give high probability bounds on the error, but we focus on expected error for simplicity.</p>

<p>This problem has been studied for both <em>pure differential privacy</em> (\(\delta = 0\)) and <em>appproximate differential privacy</em> (\(\delta &gt; 0\)), and for both \(\ell_\infty\)-error
\[
\mathbb{E}( \| M(x) - f(x)\|_{\infty} ) \leq \alpha,
\]
and \(\ell_2\)-error
\[
\mathbb{E}( \| M(x) - f(x)\|_{2} ) \leq \alpha k^{1/2},
\]
giving four variants of the problem.  By now we know tight worst-case upper and lower bounds for two of these variants, and nearly tight bounds (up to logarithmic factors) for a third. The tightest known upper bounds are given in the following table.</p>

<p>The bounds for approximate DP are known to be tight [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3158">BUV14</a>].  Our two open problems both involve improving the best known upper bounds for pure differential privacy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Open Problem 1:</b> What is the best possible \(\ell_\infty\)-error for answering a worst-case set of \(k\) statistical queries over a domain of size \(T\) subject to \((\varepsilon,0)\)-differential privacy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We conjecture that the known upper bound in the table can be improved to
\[
\alpha = \left(\frac{\log k \cdot \log T}{\varepsilon n} \right)^{1/2},
\]
which is known to be the best possible [<a href="https://dataspace.princeton.edu/handle/88435/dsp01vq27zn422">Har11</a>, Theorem 4.5.1].</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Open Problem 2:</b> What is the best possible \(\ell_2\)-error for answering a worst-case set of \(k\) statistical queries over a domain of size \(T\) subject to \((\varepsilon,0)\)-differential privacy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We conjecture that the upper bound can be improved to
\[
\alpha = \left(\frac{\log T}{\varepsilon n} \right)^{1/2}.
\]
The construction used in [<a href="https://dataspace.princeton.edu/handle/88435/dsp01vq27zn422">Har11</a>, Theorem 4.5.1] can be analyzed to show this bound would be tight. Note, in particular, that this conjecture implies that the tight upper bound has no dependence on the number of queries, similarly to the case of \(\ell_2\) error and approximate DP.</p></div>
