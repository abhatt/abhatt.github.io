<p>We hope you are all as safe and sound as possible these days, and will be for the weeks to come.</p>
<p>For those of you confined at home, it may be hard to remain connected with the TCS community or stay up-to-date with the current research, as in-person seminars and conferences are cancelled. In case this may help, we have decided to <strong>increase for now the frequency of our online seminars</strong>, to try and mitigate this aspect. This won’t restore normalcy, but every little thing counts.</p>
<p>Here is our current, now <strong>weekly</strong> schedule: we may add more talks to it in the days to come, so keep an eye on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/">our calendar</a> and don’t hesitate to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/suggest">suggest talks and results</a> you are curious about.</p>
<ul>
<li>03/25: <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~danama/">Dana Moshkovitz</a> (UT Austin) on <em>“Nearly Optimal Pseudorandomness From Hardness</em></li>
<li>04/01: <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~venkatg/">Venkat Guruswami</a> (CMU) on <em>“Arıkan meets Shannon: Polar codes with near-optimal convergence to channel capacity”</em></li>
<li>04/08: Rahul Ilango (MIT) on <em>“NP-Hardness of Circuit Minimization for Multi-Output Functions”</em></li>
<li>04/22: <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~hy2/">Huacheng Yu</a> (Princeton) on <em>“Nearly Optimal Static Las Vegas Succinct Dictionary”</em></li>
<li>04/29: <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~mahabadi/">Sepideh Mahabadi</a> (TTIC) on<em> “Non-Adaptive Adaptive Sampling on Turnstile Streams”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We emphasize that <strong>you can</strong> (and <em>should</em>) <strong>join as individuals</strong>, from home: if you are interested in a talk, ask for a spot for yourself, no need to go to your institution. We have the live audience capacity for this to work, so don’t hesitate!</p>
<p>We will post individual announcements several days before each talk, including the abstracts and how to ask for a spot, as usual; and the talks will of course be available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TCSplusSeminars/">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/past-talks">our website</a> afterwards if you couldn’t make it to the live, interactive one. Crucially, <strong>we would like your feedback</strong>: not only talk suggestions as pointed out before, but also any idea or suggestion you may have of things we could do or implement, or of content you would like to see. You can send us feedback by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/credits">emailing any of our organizers</a>, or leaving a comment below.</p>
<p>Stay safe,</p>
<p>The TCS+ team</p></div>

design problems. We observe that the underlying mathematical questions are the
spectral rounding problems, which were studied in spectral sparsification and
in discrepancy theory. We extend these results to incorporate additional linear
constraints, and show that they can be used to significantly extend the scope
of network design problems that can be solved. Our algorithm for spectral
rounding is an iterative randomized rounding algorithm based on the regret
minimization framework. In some settings, this provides an alternative spectral
algorithm to achieve constant factor approximation for survivable network
design, and partially answers a question of Bansal about survivable network
design with concentration property. We also show that the spectral rounding
results have many other applications, including weighted experimental design
and additive spectral sparsification.

The input consists of a simple polygon P, (possibly infinite) sets G and C of
points within P, and an integer k; the task is to decide if at most k guards
can be placed on points in G so that every point in C is visible to at least
one guard. In the classic formulation of Art Gallery, G and C consist of all
the points within P. Other well-known variants restrict G and C to consist
either of all the points on the boundary of P or of all the vertices of P.
Recently, three new important discoveries were made: the above mentioned
variants of Art Gallery are all W[1]-hard with respect to k [Bonnet and
Miltzow, ESA'16], the classic variant has an O(log k)-approximation algorithm
[Bonnet and Miltzow, SoCG'17], and it may require irrational guards [Abrahamsen
et al., SoCG'17]. Building upon the third result, the classic variant and the
case where G consists only of all the points on the boundary of P were both
shown to be \exists R-complete~[Abrahamsen et al., STOC'18]. Even when both G
and C consist only of all the points on the boundary of P, the problem is not
known to be in NP.
</p>
<p>Given the first discovery, the following question was posed by Giannopoulos
[Lorentz Center Workshop, 2016]: Is Art Gallery FPT with respect to r, the
number of reflex vertices? We focus on the variant where G and C are all the
vertices of P, called Vertex-Vertex Art Gallery. We show that Vertex-Vertex Art
Gallery is solvable in time r^{O(r^2)}n^{O(1)}. Our approach also extends to
assert that Vertex-Boundary Art Gallery and Boundary-Vertex Art Gallery are
both FPT. We utilize structural properties of "almost convex polygons" to
present a two-stage reduction from Vertex-Vertex Art Gallery to a new
constraint satisfaction problem (whose solution is also provided in this paper)
where constraints have arity 2 and involve monotone functions.

The aim of the graph burning
problem is to burn all the vertices in a given graph in the least amount of
time steps. The least number of required time steps is known to be the burning
number of the graph. The spread of social influence, an alarm, or a social
contagion can be modeled using graph burning. The less the burning number, the
quick the spread.
</p>
<p>Computationally, graph burning is hard. It has already been proved that
burning of path forests, spider graphs, and trees with maximum degree three are
NP-Complete. In this work we study graph burning on geometric graphs and show
NP-completeness results on several sub classes. More precisely, we show burning
problem to be NP-complete on interval graph, permutation graph and disk graph.

linear ordering of its vertices along the spine of the book and an assignment
of its edges to the pages of the book, so that no two edges on the same page
cross. The book thickness of a graph is the minimum number of pages over all
its book embeddings. For planar graphs, a fundamental result is due to
Yannakakis, who proposed an algorithm to compute embeddings of planar graphs in
books with four pages. Our main contribution is a technique that generalizes
this result to a much wider family of nonplanar graphs, which is characterized
by a biconnected skeleton of crossing-free edges whose faces have bounded
degree. Notably, this family includes all 1-planar and all optimal 2-planar
graphs as subgraphs. We prove that this family of graphs has bounded book
thickness, and as a corollary, we obtain the first constant upper bound for the
book thickness of optimal 2-planar graphs.

$m=|E|$. When we have a function $f:V\rightarrow \mathbb{N}_+$ on vertices, a
perfect $f$-factor is a generalized matching so that every vertex $u$ is
matched to $f(u)$ different edges. The previous best algorithms on this problem
have running time $O(m f(V))$ [Gabow 2018] or $\tilde{O}(W(f(V))^{2.373}))$
[Gabow and Sankowski 2013], where $W$ is the maximum edge weight, and
$f(V)=\sum_{u\in V}f(u)$. In this paper, we present a scaling algorithm for
this problem with running time $\tilde{O}(mn^{2/3}\log W)$. Previously this
bound is only known for bipartite graphs [Gabow and Tarjan 1989]. The running
time of our algorithm is independent of $f(V)$, and consequently it first
breaks the $\Omega(mn)$ barrier for large $f(V)$ even for the unweighted
$f$-factor problem in general graphs.

A point
$p\in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a plurality point for $V$ when the following holds: for
every $q\in\mathbb{R}^d$ the number of voters closer to $p$ than to $q$ is at
least the number of voters closer to $q$ than to $p$. Thus, in a vote where
each $v\in V$ votes for the nearest proposal (and voters for which the
proposals are at equal distance abstain), proposal $p$ will not lose against
any alternative proposal $q$. For most voter sets a plurality point does not
exist. We therefore introduce the concept of $\beta$-plurality points, which
are defined similarly to regular plurality points except that the distance of
each voter to $p$ (but not to $q$) is scaled by a factor $\beta$, for some
constant $0&lt;\beta\leq 1$. We investigate the existence and computation of
$\beta$-plurality points, and obtain the following results.

strategic buyers with strategic sellers. A fundamental impossibility result for
such two-sided markets due to Myerson and Satterthwaite establishes that even
in the simplest such market, that of bilateral trade, it is impossible to
design a mechanism that is individually rational, truthful, (weakly) budget
balanced, and efficient. Even worse, it is known that the "second best"
mechanism$-$the mechanism that maximizes social welfare subject to the other
constraints$-$has to be carefully tailored to the Bayesian priors and is
extremely complex.
</p>
<p>In light of this impossibility result it is very natural to seek "simple"
mechanisms that are approximately optimal, and indeed a very active line of
recent work has established a broad spectrum of constant-factor approximation
guarantees, which apply to settings well beyond those for which (implicit)
characterizations of the optimal (second best) mechanism are known.
</p>
<p>In this work, we go one step further and show that for many fundamental
two-sided markets$-$e.g., bilateral trade, double auctions, and combinatorial
double auctions$-$it is possible to design near-optimal mechanisms with
provable, constant-factor approximation guarantees with just a single sample
from the priors! In fact, most of our results in addition to requiring less
information also improve upon the best known approximation guarantees for the
respective setting.

model is reductions to two-party communication complexity. This technique has
yielded nearly tight results for various fundamental problems such as distance
computations, minimum spanning tree, minimum vertex cover, and more.
</p>
<p>In this work, we take this technique a step further, and we introduce a
framework of reductions to $t$-party communication complexity, for every $t\geq
2$. Our framework enables us to show improved hardness results for maximum
independent set. Recently, Bachrach et al.[PODC 2019] used the two-party
framework to show hardness of approximation for maximum independent set. They
show that finding a $(5/6+\epsilon)$-approximation requires $\Omega(n/\log^6
n)$ rounds, and finding a $(7/8+\epsilon)$-approximation requires
$\Omega(n^2/\log^7 n)$ rounds, in the CONGEST model where $n$ in the number of
nodes in the network.
</p>
<p>We improve the results of Bachrach et al. by using reductions to multi-party
communication complexity. Our results:
</p>
<p>(1) Any algorithm that finds a $(1/2+\epsilon)$-approximation for maximum
independent set in the CONGEST model requires $\Omega(n/\log^3 n)$ rounds.
</p>
<p>(2) Any algorithm that finds a $(3/4+\epsilon)$-approximation for maximum

<p>
Neil L. is a Leprechaun. He has visited me once every year since I started GLL. I had never seen a leprechaun before I began the blog—there must be some connection.</p>
<p>
Today, Ken and I want to share the experiences we had with him on this morning of St. Patrick’s Day.</p>
<p>
I thought because of the pandemic that he might not come. I thought that since New York City is on virtual lock-down he might not come. So I decided not to wait up for his visit, which always occurs in the wee hours of the morning. I looked it up: Wee hours is between 1am and 4am. We—that is Kathryn and I not wee—went to bed before midnight.</p>
<p>
Something woke me up at 3am. Not any noise but a bright green light. It was coming from my laptop, which was on the dresser but closed and switched off. I took it out of the bedroom and opened the lid and there he was.</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Top o’ the morning to ye. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p></p><h2> Neil Says Hi </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The first thing I noticed was: no pipe. There was no puff of smoke in my living room. Neil smokes a special brand of tobacco—green of course—that I would recognize in an instant. Otherwise he looked as usual: green coat and hat, brown vest and shoes, red beard. I could see all of him.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<em>“Glad as always to see you Neil. But why no pipe?”</em></p>
<p></p><p><br />
Neil started his usual pipe-puffing gesture but stopped his hand from touching his face.</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">‘Tis virus not microbe. Smoke nae gan do good. All of us doing without. Least of our troubles. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Wow—that was hard for me to fathom. I thought of the travel bans. <em>“Are you all having to stay home?”</em></p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Aye. We obey the bans. Crown or Republic, nae matter. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
I had to wrap my mind around this—leprechauns too? <em>“The virus applies to you?”</em></p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Sadly, we can carry it. Were it not, we could help folks point-to-point. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
I realized: leprechauns can go anywhere instantly. The planar aspects of simulations like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/">this</a> do not apply to them. Neil read my mind—at least he could do <em>that</em> remotely:</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Aye. I noted <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/12/group-testing-for-the-coronavirus/#comment-109232">all</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/12/group-testing-for-the-coronavirus/#comment-109234">your</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/12/group-testing-for-the-coronavirus/#comment-109244">comment</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/12/group-testing-for-the-coronavirus/#comment-109268">thread</a> about expander graphs and spreading the disease. Fixed dimensions don’t constrain us. This compounds our main trouble, which be…  </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Of course <em>our</em> main trouble and concern is the danger of the virus—our being able to care for those who catch it and measures to ensure many do not catch it. I realize leprechauns, being immortal, have fewer worries there—and I did not ask Neil if they can get sick. So I thought of all the canceled St. Patrick’s Day parades, bars closing, no public merriment, sporting events gone too. But Neil’s next word went straight to the heart.</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Boredom. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Boredom and Randomness </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I thought about fun things Neil had recounted in the past: tricks with <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/03/17/happy-st-patricks-day-2014/">math</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/03/17/happy-st-patricks-day-2/">codes</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/03/16/leprechauns-go-universal/">logic</a>, tricks on <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/03/17/leprechauns-will-find-you/">people</a>, even tricks during <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2017/03/17/leprechauns-are-multiplying/">March</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/03/17/leprechauns-know-what-it-feels/">Madness</a>. The NCAA tournament got completely canceled, unpostponable. Neil read my mind again and picked up on the topic of sporting events.</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Consider me neighbor Bertie. He had his accommodations booked on the wee island in the pond of the 17th hole at TPC Sawgrass. For last weekend during the Players Championship. That’s why they built the island, ye know.  </font>
</p></blockquote>

<p>
But of course, the Players was canceled. Even the Masters has been postponed. Neil continued,</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">He and his fellows’ best craic was playing with the balls goon o’er the water. Not in a nasty way. Ye know by the <b>Rule of Indistinguishability</b> we canna do them bad. Not allowed to make them play worse than other tough holes so ye could tell it is more than the usual hobgoblins in your head and butterflies in your chest. What we do must have the same expectation and other moments as random variation. But random is measure-1 so it is easy to comply. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
Of course. We have written about <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/08/23/a-world-without-randomness/">feigned</a> randomness, and we haven’t yet had time to write a post this year on scientists <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2020/03/essays-elsewhere.html">taking</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdeterminism">superdeterminism</a> <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2019/12/the-path-we-didnt-take.html">seriously</a>—<a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2020/02/guest-post-undecidability.html">even</a> <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2020/02/guest-post-undecidability_10.html">computationally</a>. How could we <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.0286.pdf">tell</a> that stuff apart from leprechauns? But thinking of Bertie gave me a more obvious question:</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<em>“Neil, can’t Bertie and his pals do that remotely? Like lots of other things we’re doing now.”</em></p>
<p></p><p><br />
Neil’s answer exposed my lack of basic leprechaun knowledge.</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">In every story of leprechaun tricks, who is present? The leprechaun. He cannot be remote—and he must run the risk of being catched. He can dance, run to the end of the rainbow, and disappear, but fun happens only when he is around. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Hearing this, I would have puffed my own pipe, if I smoked and had one. Neil continued:</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Besides, remotely we cannot control well enough to abide the Rule of Indistinguishability. </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
All this about randomness and conspiracy physics, with the world already weighing heavily, was too much. I winked out on the couch, without closing my laptop or seeing if Neil said goodbye with his usual flourish. </p>
<p>
I woke up in late morning and called Ken. As I told this part, Ken was instantly alarmed and horrified.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<em>“We must get Neil back. Is he still on your laptop?”</em> </p>
<p></p><p><br />
He was not. Ken plugged in and opened his own laptop—Neil has in the past visited him too—but nothing. He could not find any leprechauns registered on Skype or Zoom or Hangouts. Then Ken had a thought: “See if your laptop has the IP records.”</p>
<p>
It did. I could not tell what they signified, but my old IT contact at Tech said he could pinpoint the origin in minutes. Meanwhile, Ken calmed down enough to explain. I’ll let him write the rest of the story.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The One Uncanceled Competition </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What is apparently the lone major sporting competition in the world not to be canceled began today. It is chess—the Candidates Tournament to determine who will face Magnus Carlsen in the next world championship match. It is taking place in Yekaterinburg, Russia—in Siberia, still far from the worst virus activity. It has only the 8 players plus officials onsite—no spectators, press limited—and they are all subject to daily screenings. The players shake hands only <a href="https://worldchess.com/news/players-replicas-to-pose-for-photos-while-real-players-avoid-being-in-public">virtually</a>.</p>
<p>
Controversy about its starting continued today with one former World Champion, Vladimir Kramnik, stepping down from a broadcast commentary team “considering the nowadays disastrous humanitarian situation in the world.” But I’m with those saying that its value as a diversion—something to follow live in community—outweighs the concerns. I said this after some reflection on risks from our previous <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/12/group-testing-for-the-coronavirus/">post</a> and before being contacted about monitoring the tournament. One Chinese <a href="http://tiyutai.qingk.cn/comprehensivelive-info/sfbsrbdcpawqsxrbxrrvvudpcsvxpwfw/6fabf42212b308041e861a2005d12572/6b1607c0df6745e7b59e54f8a87a6309?from=singlemessage&amp;isappinstalled=0&amp;fbclid=IwAR06QhidyVdArI_RPSjTBWo2iUDVSbrJRkRvkPppohNtWT2J3AMRQxRD8Vk">broadcast</a> had over <a href="https://twitter.com/FIDE_chess/status/1239946569404817408">1 million</a> viewers today. Other broadcasts can be found on the official <a href="https://en.candidates-2020.com/main">site</a> and <a href="https://www.chess.com/tv">several</a> <a href="https://chess24.com/en/watch/live-tournaments/fide-candidates-2020/1/1/1">other</a> <a href="https://new.uschess.org/news/2020-candidates-couch-potatoes/">places</a>. Today’s first round was vigorous, with all four games going beyond the turn-40 time control and two decisive.</p>
<p>
But if it is a lone attraction for us, omigosh, for the leprechauns… Dick’s story proved they can at least <em>read</em> minds remotely. What if they all banded together to mess with the players’ moves? Neil had told of the Indistinguishability constraint, but I realized <em>my own work</em> could enable getting around it. My model enables randomly simulating a human distribution of moves at any rating level. I’ve had the idea to try a “Turing Test” akin to one Garry Kasparov turned aside, as part of the Turing Centennial in 2012, by distinguishing five games played by human 2200-level players from five by computers set to play at 2200 strength. If the leprechauns passed the Turing test at a 2800 rating level they could derange the tournament. This all verges on real concerns in my statistical anti-cheating work, with humans not leprechauns.</p>
<p>
I quickly looked up the lore for <a href="https://mysticinvestigations.com/leprechaun-summoning-spell/">summoning</a> a leprechaun. This is far more audacious than knocking on a professor’s door outside office hours—not that that will happen anytime soon. I did not have real shamrocks but strewed countryside photos from my family’s trip to Ireland last summer around my laptop. I needed Kathryn as well as Dick online by videoconference to make the quorum of three. The IT person came back with the coordinates so that uniquely Neil would be summoned. I adapted the ancient incantation to our new age of interaction by laptop: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Oh Leprechaun, Leprechaun, I humbly call unto thee,<br />
Ride the Irish rainbows of joy across the virtual sea,<br />
Let the cables be lit with the beacon of your Shillelagh,<br />
In dire peril of bad luck I make this plea,<br />
For an unknown evil lies near, I ween:<br />
Oh Leprechaun, Leprechaun, please appear on my screen! </b>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
It worked. Neil crackled into view. After a short greeting I blurted out my concerns.</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">Nae worry. Nae worry. The International Chess Federation—FIDE—took the most important step to assure the fair play.</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Wait—I know the fair-play measures FIDE developed. I’ve been part of them. That didn’t assuage what I’d just said.</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="green">FIDE put not just one but two Scotsmen on the tournament staff. One of them is in charge of fair play. Nae Leprechaun gan cross a Scotsman! </font>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
And with that Neil was gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Our hearts go out to all those affected more immediately than we so far. Amid all the worries, we wish you a happy and safe St. Patrick’s Day.</p>

Richard Guy passed away on March 9, 2020 at the age of 103. Before he died he was the worlds oldest living mathematician (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_centenarians_(scientists_and_mathematicians)">here</a> for a list of centenarians who are famous scientists or mathematicians). He was also the oldest <i>active </i>mathematician-- he had a paper on arxiv (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03379">here</a>) in October of 2019.<br />
<br />
I met him twice- once at a Gathering for Gardner, and once at an AMS meeting. I told him that Berlekamp-Conway-Guy had a great influence on me. He asked if it was a positive or negative influence. He also seemed to like my talk on The Muffin Problem, though he might have been being polite.<br />
<br />
<br />
I did a blog about Richard Guy on his 103rd birthday, so I recommend readers to go <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/09/richard-guy-is-102-years-old-today.html">there</a><br />
for more about him.  One point I want to re-iterate:<br />
<br />
Richard Guy thought of himself of an amateur mathematician. If he means someone who does it for love of the subject then this is clearly true.  If it is a measure of how good he is (the term `amateur' is sometimes used as an insult) then it is clearly false. If it means someone who does not have formal training than it is partially true.<br />

matrix is replaced by a symmetric/Hermitian matrix and the bilinear form by a
quadratic form. We call this the symmetric Grothendieck inequality; despite its
name, it is a generalization -- the original Grothendieck inequality is a
special case. While there are other proposals for such an inequality, ours
differs in two important ways: (i) we have no additional requirement like
positive semidefiniteness; (ii) our symmetric Grothendieck constant is
universal, i.e., independent of the matrix and its dimensions. A consequence of
our symmetric Grothendieck inequality is a "conic Grothendieck inequality" for
any family of cones of symmetric matrices: The original Grothendieck inequality
is a special case; as is the Nesterov $\pi/2$-Theorem, which corresponds to the
cones of positive semidefinite matrices; as well as the Goemans-Williamson
inequality, which corresponds to the cones of Laplacians. For yet other cones,
e.g., of diagonally dominant matrices, we get new Grothendieck-like
inequalities. A slight extension leads to a unified framework that treats any
Grothendieck-like inequality as an inequality between two norms within a family
of "Grothendieck norms" restricted to a family of cones. This allows us to
place on equal footing the Goemans-Williamson inequality, Nesterov
$\pi/2$-Theorem, Ben-Tal-Nemirovski-Roos $4/\pi$-Theorem, generalized
Grothendieck inequality, order-$p$ Grothendieck inequality, rank-constrained
positive semidefinite Grothendieck inequality; and in turn allows us to
simplify proofs, extend results from real to complex, obtain new bounds or
establish sharpness of existing ones. The symmetric Grothendieck inequality may
also be applied to obtain polynomial-time approximation bounds for NP-hard
combinatorial, integer, and nonconvex optimization problems.

nature. Biased by Euclidean thinking, circles are commonly considered as the
simplest. However, their constructions as digital images are only
approximations to the ideal form. Consequently, complexity orders computed in
reference to circle are unstable. Unlike circles which lose their circleness in
digital images, squares retain their qualities. Hence, we consider squares
(hypercubes in $\mathbb Z^n$) to be the simplest shapes relative to which
complexity orders are constructed. Using the connection between $L^\infty$ norm
and squares we effectively encode squareness-adapted simplification through
which we obtain multi-scale complexity measure, where scale determines the
level of interest to the boundary. The emergent scale above which the effect of
a boundary feature (appendage) disappears is related to the ratio of the
contacting width of the appendage to that of the main body. We discuss what
zero complexity implies in terms of information repetition and constructibility
and what kind of shapes in addition to squares have zero complexity.

combinatorial optimization. Apart from theoretical importance, LCS has enormous
applications in bioinformatics, revision control systems, and data comparison
programs. Although a simple dynamic program computes LCS in quadratic time, it
has been recently proven that the problem admits a conditional lower bound and
may not be solved in truly subquadratic time. In addition to this, LCS is
notoriously hard with respect to approximation algorithms. Apart from a trivial
sampling technique that obtains a $n^{x}$ approximation solution in time
$O(n^{2-2x})$ nothing else is known for LCS. This is in sharp contrast to its
dual problem edit distance for which several linear time solutions are obtained
in the past two decades.

minimizing the total processing time of tardy jobs on a single machine. This is
not only a fundamental scheduling problem, but also a very important problem
from a theoretical point of view as it generalizes the Subset Sum problem and
is closely related to the 0/1-Knapsack problem. The problem is well-known to be
NP-hard, but only in a weak sense, meaning it admits pseudo-polynomial time
algorithms. The fastest known pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for the problem
is the famous Lawler and Moore algorithm which runs in $O(P \cdot n)$ time,
where $P$ is the total processing time of all $n$ jobs in the input. This
algorithm has been developed in the late 60s, and has yet to be improved to
date.
</p>
<p>In this paper we develop two new algorithms for $1||\sum p_jU_j$, each
improving on Lawler and Moore's algorithm in a different scenario. Both
algorithms rely on basic primitive operations between sets of integers and
vectors of integers for the speedup in their running times. The second
algorithm relies on fast polynomial multiplication as its main engine, while
for the first algorithm we define a new "skewed" version of
$(\max,\min)$-convolution which is interesting in its own right.

(Haussler--Welzl 1987), which we call the "$\epsilon$-$t$-net problem": Given a
hypergraph on $n$ vertices and parameters $t$ and $\epsilon\geq \frac t n$,
find a minimum-sized family $S$ of $t$-element subsets of vertices such that
each hyperedge of size at least $\epsilon n$ contains a set in $S$. When $t=1$,
this corresponds to the $\epsilon$-net problem.
</p>
<p>We prove that any sufficiently large hypergraph with VC-dimension $d$ admits
an $\epsilon$-$t$-net of size $O(\frac{ (1+\log t)d}{\epsilon} \log
\frac{1}{\epsilon})$. For some families of geometrically-defined hypergraphs
(such as the dual hypergraph of regions with linear union complexity), we prove
the existence of $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$-sized $\epsilon$-$t$-nets.
</p>
<p>We also present an explicit construction of $\epsilon$-$t$-nets (including
$\epsilon$-nets) for hypergraphs with bounded VC-dimension. In comparison to
previous constructions for the special case of $\epsilon$-nets (i.e., for
$t=1$), it does not rely on advanced derandomization techniques. To this end we
introduce a variant of the notion of VC-dimension which is of independent
interest.

adversary's power to artificially induce disagreements. We approach these
questions by extending models of opinion formation in the social sciences to
represent scenarios, familiar from recent events, in which external actors seek
to destabilize communities through sophisticated information warfare tactics
via fake news and bots. In many instances, the intrinsic goals of these efforts
are not necessarily to shift the overall sentiment of the network, but rather
to induce discord. These perturbations diffuse via opinion dynamics on the
underlying network, through mechanisms that have been analyzed and abstracted
through work in computer science and the social sciences. We investigate the
properties of such attacks, considering optimal strategies both for the
adversary seeking to create disagreement and for the entities tasked with
defending the network from attack. We show that for different formulations of
these types of objectives, different regimes of the spectral structure of the
network will limit the adversary's capacity to sow discord; this enables us to
qualitatively describe which networks are most vulnerable against these
perturbations. We then consider the algorithmic task of a network defender to
mitigate these sorts of adversarial attacks by insulating nodes
heterogeneously; we show that, by considering the geometry of this problem,
this optimization task can be efficiently solved via convex programming.
Finally, we generalize these results to allow for two network structures, where
the opinion dynamics process and the measurement of disagreement become
uncoupled, and determine how the adversary's power changes; for instance, this
may arise when opinion dynamics are controlled an online community via social
media, while disagreement is measured along "real-world" connections.

has attention turned to attacks that account for geographic information, which
are extremely common in the real world. The most well known in the media is
gerrymandering, in which district border-lines are changed to increase a
party's chance to win, but a different geographical manipulation involves
influencing the election by selecting the location of polling places, as many
people are not willing to go to any distance to vote. In this paper we initiate
the study of this manipulation. We find that while it is easy to manipulate the
selection of polling places on the line, it becomes difficult already on the
plane or in the case of more than two candidates. Moreover, we show that for
more than two candidates the problem is inapproximable. However, we find a few
restricted cases on the plane where some algorithms perform well. Finally, we
discuss how existing results for standard control actions hold in the
geographic setting, consider additional control actions in the geographic
setting, and suggest directions for future study.

collaborative tasks to requesters that are consistent with deployment
parameters they desire: a lower-bound on the quality of the crowd contribution,
an upper-bound on the latency of task completion, and an upper-bound on the
cost incurred by paying workers. A deployment strategy is a choice of value for
three dimensions: Structure (whether to solicit the workforce sequentially or
simultaneously), Organization (to organize it collaboratively or
independently), and Style (to rely solely on the crowd or to combine it with
machine algorithms). We propose StratRec, an optimization-driven middle layer
that recommends deployment strategies and alternative deployment parameters to
requesters by accounting for worker availability. Our solutions are grounded in
discrete optimization and computational geometry techniques that produce
results with theoretical guarantees. We present extensive experiments on Amazon
Mechanical Turk and conduct synthetic experiments to validate the qualitative

and present data structures with linear or almost-linear space usage. Our
results can be also used to answer four-dimensional queries that are bounded on
five sides. The first data structure presented in this paper uses linear space
and answers queries in $O(\log^{1+\varepsilon}n + k\log^{\varepsilon} n)$ time,
where $k$ is the number of reported points, $n$ is the number of points in the
data structure, and $\varepsilon$ is an arbitrarily small positive constant.
Our second data structure uses $O(n \log^{\varepsilon} n)$ space and answers
queries in $O(\log n+k)$ time.
</p>
<p>These are the first data structures for this problem that use linear (resp.
$O(n\log^{\varepsilon} n)$) space and answer queries in poly-logarithmic time.
For comparison the fastest previously known linear-space or
$O(n\log^{\varepsilon} n)$-space data structure supports queries in
$O(n^{\varepsilon} + k)$ time (Bentley and Mauer, 1980). Our results can be
generalized to $d\ge 4$ dimensions. For example, we can answer $d$-dimensional
dominance range reporting queries in $O(\log\log n (\log n/\log\log n)^{d-3} +
k)$ time using $O(n\log^{d-4+\varepsilon}n)$ space. Compared to the fastest
previously known result (Chan, 2013), our data structure reduces the space
usage by $O(\log n)$ without increasing the query time.

node in a network, and chooses a distinct port number from $\{1,\ldots,d\}$ for
every edge outgoing from a node of degree $d$. Then, given the labels of $u$
and $w$ and no other information about the network, it should be possible to
determine the port number corresponding to the first edge on the shortest path
from $u$ to $w$. In their seminal paper, Thorup and Zwick [SPAA 2001] designed
several routing methods for general weighted networks. An important technical
ingredient in their paper that according to the authors ``may be of independent
practical and theoretical interest'' is a routing labeling scheme for trees of
arbitrary degrees. For a tree on $n$ nodes, their scheme constructs labels
consisting of $(1+o(1))\log n$ bits such that the sought port number can be
computed in constant time. Looking closer at their construction, the labels
consist of $\log n + O(\log n\cdot \log\log\log n / \log\log n)$ bits. Given
that the only known lower bound is $\log n+\Omega(\log\log n)$, a natural
question that has been asked for other labeling problems in trees is to
determine the asymptotics of the smaller-order term.
</p>
<p>We make the first (and significant) progress in 19 years on determining the
correct second-order term for the length of a label in a routing labeling
scheme for trees on $n$ nodes. We design such a scheme with labels of length
$\log n+O((\log\log n)^{2})$. Furthermore, we modify the scheme to allow for
computing the port number in constant time at the expense of slightly
increasing the length to $\log n+O((\log\log n)^{3})$.

solver for the vertex cover problem can compete favorably with integer linear
programming solvers (e.g., CPLEX). Our research question is are there graph
characteristics that determine which reductions will be most effective? Not
only is the answer affirmative, but relevant characteristics are easy to
identify. To explore our ideas, we provide an enhanced version of the
Akiba-Iwata solver that can (a) be configured with any subset of reductions and
lower bounds; (b) print statistics such as time taken and number of vertices
reduced by each reduction. Based on extensive experiments with benchmark and
random instances we demonstrate that (i) more reductions do not necessarily
lead to better runtimes; (ii) the subset of reductions leading to the best (or
nearly the best) runtime can be predicted based on measurable characteristics
of a graph, e.g., density and degree distribution; and (iii) exceptions have
structural characteristics known in advance. Our primary contributions are 1. A
thorough examination reduction routine performance in the context of graph
characteristics. 2. Three primary hypotheses suggesting simple suites of
reductions as the most efficient options. 3. Experiments with a large corpus of
data to validate our hypotheses. 4. Measures that quantify a problem instance
on two key dimensions to make our hypotheses concrete. 5. An enhanced
open-source version of the Akiba-Iwata solver that enables our investigations
and creates opportunities for future exploration. Our main objective is to
provide guidance to a user so that, faced with a given problem instance or set
of instances, they may most effectively use the available reductions.
Ultimately these efforts can lead to an automated process.

in which the topological structure of a data set can be observed by persistent
homology. By considering a sequence of sublevel sets, one obtains a filtration
that tracks changes in topological information. These changes can be recorded
in multi-sets known as {\it persistence diagrams}. Converting information
stored in persistence diagrams into a form compatible with modern machine
learning algorithms is a major vein of research in TDA. {\it Persistence
curves}, a recently developed framework, provides a canonical and flexible way
to encode the information presented in persistence diagrams into vectors. In
this work, we propose a new set of metrics based on persistence curves. We
prove the stability of the proposed metrics. Finally, we apply these metrics to
the UCR Time Series Classification Archive. These empirical results show that
our metrics perform better than the relevant benchmark in most cases and
warrant further study.

We suggest a general framework to study dependency schemes for dependency quantified Boolean formulas (DQBF). As our main contribution, we exhibit a new tautology-free DQBF dependency scheme that generalises the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme. We establish soundness of the tautology-free scheme, implying that it can be used in any DQBF proof system. We further explore the power of DQBF resolution systems parameterised by dependency schemes and show that our new scheme results in exponentially shorter proofs in comparison to the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme when used in the basic DQBF expansion proof system.

On QBFs, we demonstrate that our new scheme is exponentially stronger than the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme when used in Q Resolution, thus resulting in the strongest QBF dependency scheme known to date.</div>

We revisit one original motivation for the study of no-signaling multi-prover
  interactive proofs (NS-MIPs): specifically, that two spatially separated
  provers are guaranteed to be no-signaling by the physical principle that
  information cannot travel from one point to another faster than light.

  We observe that with more than two provers, the physical connection between
  no-signaling and faster-than-light communication is more nuanced, depending on
  the relative positioning of the provers.  In particular, we observe that
  provers are guaranteed to be no-signaling if and only if their positions are
  convexly independent.  Other prover positionings provide weaker guaranteees.

  We consider a new issue that thus arises only in the many-prover setting:
  how precisely must provers be positioned in order to guarantee the
    soundness of a (NS-)MIP?  We prove that substantially more precision is
  required to guarantee full no-signaling than to guarantee soundness of a
  specific NS-MIP for PSPACE implicit in the work of Kalai and Raz (CRYPTO 2009).</div>

<p>Things do not look that good, and these are difficult times. But here on the blog we have plenty of things to cheer you up and assure you.

<p>Famously, the mathematician Paul Erdős, often referred to “The Book” in which God keeps the most elegant proof of each mathematical theorem. During a lecture in 1985, Erdős said, “You don’t have to believe in God, but you should believe in The Book.” (And you do not have even to believe in the book to enjoy proofs from the book.)</p>
<h2>The Theorem: a 1978 conjecture by Erdős and Purdy</h2>
<p><strong>Theorem: </strong> Let <em>P</em> be a set of <em>n</em> points in general position in the plane. Suppose that <em>R</em> is a set of red points disjoint from <em>P</em> such that every line determined by <em>P</em> passes through a point in <em>R</em>. Then <em>|R|≥ n</em> for <em>n &gt; 6</em>.</p>
<p>This theorem settles a problem by Erdős and Purdy from 1978. Erdős and Purdy also asked about the case where the set of points is not required to be in general position. For that problem the best known lower bound, also proved by Rom Pinchasi, is <em>n/3</em>.</p>
<p>Book Proof I: <a href="http://www2.math.technion.ac.il/~room/ps_files/EP_genpos.pdf">An algebraic solution of a problem of Erdős and Purdy</a>, by Rom Pinchasi</p>
<p>Book Proof II: <a href="http://www2.math.technion.ac.il/~room/ps_files/EP_book.pdf">A one-page solution of a problem of Erdős and Purdy, by Rom Pinchasi and Alexandr Polyanskii</a></p>
<h2>Murty’s magic configurations conjecture.</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www2.math.technion.ac.il/~room/ps_files/magic.pdf">first proof of the Erdős-Purdy 1978 Conjecture</a> was achieved in 2008 by Eyal Ackerman, Kevin Buchin, Christian Knauer, Rom Pinchasi, and Günter Rote. They derived it from their solution to the 1971 conjecture on magic configurations by Murty. A planar set of points P is called magic if it possible to assign positive weights to the points so that the sum of weights in every line determined by the points is one. Murty conjectured that the only magic configurations are those in general position, and those which have a line missing at most one of the points, and a certain configuration of seven points.</p>
<h2>The Pinchasi-Polyanskii Book-Proof:</h2>
<p>Here, we very closely follow the Pinchasi-Polyanskii’s paper.</p>
<p>We say that a line is determined by a set of points in the plane if it contains at least two of the points. Since the points in P are in general position, each pair of points determines a different line.</p>
<p>Under the contrary assumption we must have <em>|R| = n−1</em>. Then it must be that every point in <em>R</em> is incident to precisely <em>n/2</em> lines determined by <em>P</em> and every line determined by <em>P</em> is incident to precisely one point in <em>R</em>. We would like to reach a contradiction.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Preliminary step: apply a projective transformation to the plane such that the convex hull of <em>P</em> becomes a triangle.</span></p>
<p><strong>Observation 1:</strong>  No point of R lies outside the convex hull of P.</p>
<p>Such a point <em>r</em> should be incident to two lines supporting the convex hull of <em>P</em>. Each of these supporting lines must contain precisely two points of <em>P</em>. Since the convex hull of <em>P</em> is a triangle this is impossible.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Regard the points in the plane as complex numbers. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #339966;">(This is really cool. I am not aware of many examples in discrete geometry that thinking about planar points as complex numbers helps.)</span></p>
<p>Notation: for every point<em> p</em> in the plane we denote by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="p_x" class="latex" title="p_x" />  the <em>x</em>-coordinate of <em>p</em>.</p>
<p>Crucial definition: For every point <em>p ∈ P</em> deﬁne</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28p%29+%3D+%5Cprod_%7Br+%5Cin+R%7D%28p-r%29+%2F+%5Cprod_%7Bp%27+%5Cin+P%5Cbackslash+%5C%7Bp%5C%7D%7D%28p-p%27%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f(p) = \prod_{r \in R}(p-r) / \prod_{p' \in P\backslash \{p\}}(p-p')." class="latex" title="f(p) = \prod_{r \in R}(p-r) / \prod_{p' \in P\backslash \{p\}}(p-p')." /></p>
<p><strong>Observation 2:</strong> <em>f(p)</em> is a real number!</p>
<p>The proof will surely make you smile: For every <em>p’ ∈ P \{p}</em> there is a unique <em>r ∈ R</em> such that <em>p, p’</em>, and <em>r</em> are collinear. So <em>(p-r)/(p-p’)</em> is real. And the big ratio between products split to many small fractions that are all real.  <span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Walla!</strong></span></p>
<p>Note that <em>f(p)</em> is thus also invariant under rotations of the plane.</p>
<p>Now, if the vertical line through p does not contain any other point in P ∪ R, then, for the unique <em>r ∈ R</em> such that <em>p, p’</em>, and<em> r</em> are collinear, we have that:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%29%7E%7E%7E%28p-r%29%2F%28p-p%27%29%7E%3D%7E%28p_x-r_x%29%2F%28p_x-p%27_x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(1)~~~(p-r)/(p-p')~=~(p_x-r_x)/(p_x-p'_x)" class="latex" title="(1)~~~(p-r)/(p-p')~=~(p_x-r_x)/(p_x-p'_x)" />.</p>
<p>This leads to:</p>
<p><strong>Observation 3:</strong>  if the vertical line through <em>p</em> does not contain any other point in <em>P ∪ R</em>, then</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%282%29%7E%7E%7E+f%28p%29+%3D+%5Cprod_%7Br+%5Cin+R%7D%28p_x-r_x%29+%2F+%5Cprod_%7Bp%27+%5Cin+P%5Cbackslash+%5C%7Bp%5C%7D%7D%28p_x-p%27_x%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(2)~~~ f(p) = \prod_{r \in R}(p_x-r_x) / \prod_{p' \in P\backslash \{p\}}(p_x-p'_x)." class="latex" title="(2)~~~ f(p) = \prod_{r \in R}(p_x-r_x) / \prod_{p' \in P\backslash \{p\}}(p_x-p'_x)." /></p>
<p><strong>Crucial observation 4:</strong>  Let <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> be any two points in <em>P</em> and let <em>r</em> be the unique point in <em>R</em> collinear with <em>p</em> and<em> q</em>. Then</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>f(p)/f(q)=-(p-r)/(q-r).</em></h3>
<p>To see this rotate the plane so that the x-coordinates of <em>p,q</em>, and <em>r</em> are equal (or nearly equal) and apply Equations (2) and (1). (You will get the same, or nearly the same, contributions for <em>r’ ≠ r</em>  and you are left with the contribution for <em>r</em>. ) This also leads to:</p>
<p><strong>Observation 5:</strong> <em>f(p)/f(q)</em> <em>&gt;0</em>  if and only if the unique point <em>r ∈ R</em> that is collinear with <em>p</em> and<em> q</em> lies in the straight line segment delimited by <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>.</p>
<h3>A complete graph with green and red edges.</h3>
<p>Consider the complete graph <em>G</em> whose vertices are the points in <em>P</em>. For every two points <em>p, q ∈ P</em> we color the edge connecting  <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>red</strong></span> if the unique point in <em>R</em> collinear with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> lies outside the straight line segment connecting <em>p</em> and<em> q. </em>Otherwise we color the edge <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>green</strong></span>. In other words, the edge is <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">red</span></strong> if<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> f(p)/f(q) &lt; 0</span></strong>, and <strong><span style="color: #339966;">green</span></strong> if <strong><span style="color: #339966;">f(p)/f(q) &gt; 0</span></strong>.</p>
<p>The vertices of G can naturally be partitioned into two sets:<i> U = {p ∈ P | f(p) &gt; 0}</i> and<i> W = {p ∈ P | f(p) &lt; 0}</i>.</p>
<p>Without loss of generality assume that the three vertices of the convex hull of P belong to <em>U</em>. (Since no point of R is outside this convex hull all edges of the triangle forming the convex hull are green.)</p>
<p><strong>Observation 6:</strong> <em>|U| = n/2 + 1.</em></p>
<p>To see this let <em>a,b</em> ∈ <em>U</em> be two vertices of the convex hull of <em>P</em>. Let <em>c</em> ∈ <em>R</em> be the point in <em>R</em> collinear with <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>. The point <em>c</em> must be between <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> on the boundary of the convex hull of <em>P</em>. Therefore, all the other n/2 −1 pairs of points of <em>P</em> that are collinear with c must form red edges. Consequently, precisely one point of every such pair belongs to U. Together with <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, we obtain <em>|U| = n/2+1</em>.</p>
<p><strong>End of proof:</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-19479"></span></p>
<p>Consider now any triangulation of the convex hull of <em>P</em> using all the vertices of <em>U</em>. This triangulation contains precisely <em>3|U|−6</em> edges all of which correspond to green edges in the graph <em>G</em>. Each edge in the triangulation contains a unique point in <em>R</em>. Therefore,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>|R|≥ 3|1|−6 = 3n/2 −3.</em></p>
<p>This expression is greater than or equal to <em>n</em> for every <em>n ≥ 6</em>, as desired. <span style="color: #993366;"><strong>ahla!</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #339966;">(Good old Euler’s theorem is used.)</span></p>
<h2>Related things.</h2>
<p>Yesterday, our PM explained on TV what geometric (exponential) growth is.  If I try to describe related results and problems to the theorem presented here, and move on to related results and problems to those and so on, the amount of beautiful results from discrete geometry will grow exponentially but this post will never be completed.</p>
<p>So let me mention just a few things.</p>
<ol>
<li>The result is related to the Motzkin-Rabin Colorful Sylvester-Gallai theorem. Given a set of red points and blue points in the plane, not all on a line, the Motzkin-Rabin theorem asserts that there is a line that contains two or more points in the set, such that all the points on the line have the same color.</li>
<li>Starting with the Sylvester-Gallai theorem itself, there is a rich Gallai-Sylvester theory, with recent deep connections to the theory of computing; My <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/4661/the-sylvester-gallai-theorem-and-sections-of-varieties-with-simple-topology">third MathOverflow question</a> was about a Sylvester-Gallai type problem and here is a link to <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/4661/the-sylvester-gallai-theorem-and-sections-of-varieties-with-simple-topology#comment8133_4661">Greg Kuperberg remark</a>‘s regarding potential Gylvester-Kalai theorems.</li>
<li>Let me mention the <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2012/08/24/on-sets-defining-few-ordinary-lines/">2012 solution by Ben Green and Terry Tao</a> of the ordinary line conjecture and the Orchard conjecture.</li>
<li>Let me mention the proof of Andreii Kupavskii and Alexandr Polyanskii to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.3694.pdf">Shur’s conjecture</a>.</li>
<li>Here is a <a href="http://www2.math.technion.ac.il/~room/ps_files/EPnCubic_s2.pdf">link to a very recent paper</a> by Chaya Keller and Rom Pinchasi. There they make the following <strong>bold conjecture</strong>: Let <em>P</em> be a set of n points in general position and and let <em>R</em> be a set of n points disjoint from P. If every line determined by P passes through a point in<em> R,</em> then <em>P </em>∪<em> R</em> is contained in a cubic curve.</li>
<li>There is, of course the famous book by Martin Aigner and Günter Ziegler: Proofs from the book.</li>
<li>At some point I tried to interest Günter with a companion book: The book of examples. We did not proceed with this project but this motivated my successful <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/4994/fundamental-examples">MathOverflow questions about fundamental examples</a>.</li>
<li>Eventually, Günter and I decided to write instead: the book of examples of polytopes. We went as far as writing a list of chapters of the book! (Which is a very advanced stage of writing a book, I suppose.)</li>
<li>When I took a class for high-school students interested in mathematics, the Sylvester problem was a starred problem in the first problem set and the assertion of the Motzkin-Rabin colored theorem was a double starred problem. Among the 20-30 students none of us found a (correct) solution. (We referred to it in a trivia question in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/05/26/natis-influence/">this post</a>.) Years later, I gave the same class and gave the same starred problems, and one student managed to prove the Gallai-Sylvester theorem. Can you guess who he was?</li>

<p>When I launched bit-player.org in 2006, displaying any sort of mathematical notation on the web was torture. I would typeset an equation in LaTeX, convert the output to a JPEG image, upload the image file to a directory on the server, and embed a reference to the file in an HTML <code>img</code> tag. The process was cumbersome and the product was ugly. In 2009 I wrote <a href="http://bit-player.org/bph-publications/AmSci-2009-03-Hayes-webmath.pdf">an <em>American Scientist</em> article</a> whining about this sorry state of affairs—but at just that moment an elegant solution was coming on the scene. Davide Cervone of Union College had created a program called jsMath, which could process TeX commands placed directly in an HTML document. For example, I could write:</p>
<pre style="text-align: center;"><code>e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots</code></pre>
<p>and it would appear on your screen as:</p>
<p>\[e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots\]</p>
<p class="undent">All the work of parsing the TeX code and typesetting the math was done by a JavaScript program downloaded into your browser along with the rest of the web page.</p>
<p>Cervone’s jsMath soon evolved into <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>, an <a href="https://github.com/mathjax">open-source project</a> initially supported by the AMS and SIAM. There are now about two dozen sponsors, and the project is under the aegis of <a href="https://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a>. From the MathJax web page: “The MathJax team consists of Davide Cervone and Volker Sorge. Regular contributors include Christian Lawson-Perfect, Omar Al-Ithawi, and Peter Krautzberger.”Cervone remains the principal author, though not the only contributor.</p>
<p>MathJax has made a big difference in my working life, transforming a problem into a pleasure. Putting math on the web is fun! Sometimes I do it just to show off. Furthermore, the software has served as an inspiration as well as a helpful tool. Until I saw MathJax in action, it simply never occurred to me that interesting computations could be done within the JavaScript environment of a web browser, which I had thought was there mainly to make things blink and jiggle. With the example of MathJax in front of me, I realized that I could not only display mathematical ideas but also explore and animate them within a web page.</p>
<hr />
<p>Last fall I began hearing rumors about MathJax 3.0, “a complete rewrite of MathJax from the ground up using modern techniques.” It’s the kind of announcement that inspires both excitement and foreboding. What will the new version add? What will it take away? What will it fix? What will it break?</p>
<p>Before committing all of bit-player to the new version, I thought I would try a small-scale experiment. I have a standalone web page that makes particularly tricky use of MathJax. The page is a repository of the <a href="https://bit-player.github.io/dotster/">Dotster</a> programs extracted from a recent bit-player post, <a href="http://bit-player.org/2019/my-god-its-full-of-dots">My God, it’s full of dots</a>. In January I got the Dotster page running with MathJax 3.</p>
<p>Most math in web documents is static content: An equation needs to be formatted once, when the page is first displayed, and it never changes after that. The initial type­setting is handled automatically by MathJax, in both the old and the new versions. As soon as the page is downloaded from the server, MathJax makes a pass through the entire text, identifying elements flagged as TeX code and replacing them with typeset math. Once that job is done, MathJax can go to sleep.</p>
<p>The Dotster programs are a little different; they include equations that change dynamically in response to user input. Here’s an example:</p>


<p>The slider on the left sets a numerical value that gets plugged into the two equation on the right. Each time the slider is moved, the equations need to be updated and reformatted. Thus with each change to the slider setting, MathJax has to wake up from its slumbers and run again to typeset the altered content.</p>
<p>The MathJax program running in the little demo above is the older version, 2.7. Cosmetically, the result is not ideal. With each change in the slider value, the two equations contract a bit, as if pinched between somebody’s fingers, and then snap back to their original size. They seem to wink at us. The progress banner would normally appear in the lower left corner of the browser window, where it is less intrusive. It has a more prominent position here because the demo is encapsulated in an iFrame, which acts as a window within the window. This structure is necessary in order to run two versions of MathJax in a single page. Also, a small gray progress indicator pops up in the lower left corner and hangs around just long enough to grab your attention. It says: “Typesetting math: 100%.” I find these visual distractions pretty annoying. They are analogous to the dreaded FOUC—the “flash of unstyled content”—that appears when a web browser displays the text of a page before the associated stylesheets are fully loaded and processed.</p>
<p>The winking effect is caused by a MathJax feature called Fast Preview. The system does a quick-and-dirty rendering of the math content without calculating <img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/math-settings-submenus.png" height="180" width="350" alt="Math settings submenus" border="0" class="alignright" /> the correct final sizes for the various typographic ele­ments. (Evi­dently that calculation takes a little time). You can turn off Fast Preview by right-clicking or control-clicking one of the equa­tions and then navigating through the sub­menus shown at right. How­ever, you’ll probably judge the result to be worse rather than better. Without Fast Preview, you’ll get a  glimpse of the raw TeX commands. Instead of winking, the equations do jumping jacks.</p>
<p>I am delighted to report that all of this visual noise has been eliminated in the new MathJax. On changing a slider setting, the equations are updated in place, with no unnecessary visual fuss. And there’s no need for a progress indication, because the change is so quick it appears to be instantaneous. See for yourself:</p>


<p>Thus version 3 looks like a big win. There’s a caveat: Getting it to work did not go quite as smoothly as I had hoped. Nevertheless, this is a story with a happy ending.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you have only static math content in your documents, making the switch to MathJax 3 is easy. In your HTML file you change a URL to load the new MathJax version, and convert any configuration options to a new format. As it happens, all the default options work for me, so I had nothing to convert. What’s most important about the upgrade path is what you <em>don’t</em> need to do. In most cases you should not have to alter any of the TeX commands present in the HTML files being processed by MathJax. (There are a <a href="http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/v2.html#input-changes">few small exceptions</a>.)</p>
<p>With dynamic content, further steps are needed. Here is the JavaScript statement I used to reawaken the typesetting engine in MathJax version 2.7:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code>MathJax.Hub.Queue(["Typeset", MathJax.Hub, mathjax_demo_box]);
</code></pre>
<p>The statement enters a <code>Typeset</code> command into a queue of pending tasks. When the command reaches the front of the queue, MathJax will typeset any math found inside the HTML element designated by the identifier <code>mathjax_demo_box</code>, ignoring the rest of the document.</p>
<p>In MathJax 3, the <a href="http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/web/typeset.html#typesetting-math-in-a-web-page">documentation</a> suggested I could simply replace this command with a slightly different and more direct one:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code>MathJax.typeset([mathjax_demo_box]);
</code></pre>
<p>I did that. It didn’t work. When I moved the slider, the displayed math reverted to raw TeX form, and I found an error message in the JavaScript console:</p>
<p><img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/appendChild-null-error-530x170.png" height="170" width="530" alt="AppendChild null error 530x170" border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p>What has gone wrong here? JavaScript’s <code>appendChild</code> method adds a new node to the treelike structure of an HTML document. It’s like hanging an ornament from some specified branch of a Christmas tree. The error reported here indicates that the specified branch does not exist; it is <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s not tarry over my various false starts and wrong turns as I puzzled over the source of this bug. I eventually found the cause and the solution in the “issues” section of the MathJax repository on GitHub. Back in September of last year Mihai Borobocea had <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues/2191">reported a similar problem</a>, along with the interesting observation that the error occurs only when an existing TeX expression is being replaced in a document, not when a new expression is being added. Borobocea had also discovered that invoking the procedure <code>MathJax.typesetClear()</code> before <code>MathJax.typeset()</code> would prevent the error.</p>
<p>A comment by Cervone explains much of what’s going on:</p>
<blockquote><p>You are correct that you should use <code>MathJax.typesetClear()</code> if you have removed previously typeset math from the page. (In version 3, there is information stored about the math in a list of typeset expressions, and if you remove typeset math from the page and replace it with new math, that list will hold pointers to math that no longer exists in the page. That is what is causing the error you are seeing . . . )</p></blockquote>
<p>I found that adding <code>MathJax.typesetClear()</code> did indeed eliminate the error. As a practical matter, that solved my problem. But Borobocea pointed out a remaining loose end. Whereas <code>MathJax.typeset([mathjax_demo_box])</code> operates only on the math inside a specific container, <code>MathJax.typesetClear()</code> destroys the list of math objects for the entire document, an act that might later have unwanted consequences. Thus it seemed best to reformat all the math in the document whenever any one expression changes. This is inefficient, but with the 20-some equations in the Dotster web page the typesetting is so fast there’s no perceptible delay.</p>
<p>In January a fix for this problem was merged into MathJax 3.0.1, which is now the shipping version. Cervone’s comment on this change says that it “prevents the error message,” which left me with the impression that it might suppress the message without curing the error itself. But as far as I can tell the entire issue has been cleared up. There’s no longer any need to invoke <code>MathJax.typesetClear()</code>.</p>
<hr />
<p>In my first experiments with version 3.0 I stumbled onto another bit of weirdness, but it turned out to be a quirk of my own code, not something amiss in MathJax. </p>
<p>I was seeing occasional size variations in typeset math that seemed reminiscent of the winking problem in version 2.7. <img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/zs-large-and-small-math.png" height="99" width="159" alt="large and small math superimposed" border="0" class="alignright" />Sometimes the initial, automatic typesetting would leave the equations in a slightly smaller size; they would grow back to normal as soon as <code>MathJax.typeset()</code> was applied. In the image at right I have superimposed the two states, with the correct, larger image colored red. It looks like Fast Preview has come back to haunt us, but that can’t be right, because Fast Preview has been removed entirely from version 3.</p>
<p>My efforts to solve this mystery turned into quite a debugging debacle. I got a promising clue from an exchange on the <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/mathjax-docs/wiki/Dealing-with-display:none">MathJax wiki</a>, discussing size anomalies when math is composed inside an HTML element temporarily flagged <code>display: none</code>, a style rule that makes the math invisible. In that circumstance MathJax has no information about the surrounding text, and so it leaves the typeset math in a default state. The same mechanism might account for what I was seeing—except that my page has no elements with a <code>display: none</code> style.</p>
<p>I first observed this problem in the Chrome browser, where it is intermittent; when I repeatedly reloaded the page, the small type would appear about one time out of five. What fun! It takes multiple trials just to know whether an attempted fix has had any effect. Thus I was pleased to discover that in Firefox the shrunken type appears consistently, every time the page is loaded. Testing became a great deal easier.</p>
<p>I soon found a cure, though not a diagnosis. While browsing again in the MathJax issues archive and in a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?pli=1#!forum/mathjax-users">MathJax user forum</a>, I came across suggestions to try a different form of output, with mathematical expressions constructed not from text elements in HTML and style rules in CSS but from paths drawn in Scalable Vector Graphics, or SVG. I found that the SVG expressions were stable and consistent in size, and in other respects indistinguishable from their HTML siblings. Again my problem was solved, but I still wanted to know the underlying cause.</p>
<p>Here’s where the troubleshooting report gets a little embarrassing. Thinking I might have a new bug to report, I set out to build a minimal exemplar—the smallest and simplest program that would trigger the bug. I failed. I was starting from a blank page and adding more and more elements of the original program—<code>div</code>s nested inside <code>div</code>s in the HTML, various stylesheet rules in the CSS, bigger collections of more complex equations—but none of these additions produced the slightest glitch in typesetting. So I tried working in the other direction, starting with the complex misbehaving program and stripping away elements until the problem disappeared. But it didn’t disappear, even when I reduced the page to a single equation in a plain white box.</p>
<p>As often happens, I found the answer not by banging my head against the problem but by going for a walk. Out in the fresh air, I finally noticed the one oddity that distinguished the failing program from all of the correctly working ones. Because the Dotster program began life embedded in a WordPress blog post, I could not include a link to the CSS stylesheet in the <code>head</code> section of the HTML file. Instead, a JavaScript function constructed the link and inserted it into the <code>head</code>. That happened <em>after</em> MathJax made its initial pass over the text. At the time of typesetting, the elements in which the equations were placed had no styles applied, and so MathJax had no way of determining appropriate sizes.</p>
<hr />
<p>When Don Knuth unveiled TeX, circa 1980, I was amazed. Back then, typewriter-style word processing was impressive enough. TeX did much more: real typesetting, with multiple fonts (which Knuth also had to create from scratch), automatic hyphenation and justification, and beautiful mathematics.</p>
<p>Thirty years later, when Cervone created MathJax, I was amazed again—though perhaps not for the right reasons. I had supposed that the major programming challenge would be capturing all the finicky rules and heuristics for building up math expressions—placing and sizing superscripts, adjusting the height and width of parentheses or a radical sign to match the dimensions of the expression enclosed, spacing and aligning the elements of a matrix. Those are indeed nontrivial tasks, but they are just the beginning. My recent adventures have helped me see that another major challenge is making TeX work in an alien environment.</p>
<p>In classic TeX, the module that typesets equations has direct access to everything it might ever need to know about the surrounding text—type sizes, line spacing, column width, the amount of interword “glue” needed to justify a line of type. Sharing this information is easy because all the formatting is done by the same program. MathJax faces a different situation. Formatting duties are split, with MathJax handling mathematical content but the browser’s layout engine doing everything else. Indeed, the document is written in two different languages, TeX for the math and HTML/CSS for the rest. Coordinating actions in the two realms is not straightforward.</p>
<p>There are other complications of importing TeX into a web page. The classic TeX system runs in batch mode. It takes some inputs, produces its output, and then quits. Batch processing would not offer a pleasant experience in a web browser. The entire user interface (such as the buttons and sliders in my Dotster programs) would be frozen for the duration. To avoid this kind of rudeness to the user, MathJax is never allowed to monopolize JavaScript’s single thread of execution for more than a fraction of a second. To ensure this cooperative behavior, earlier versions relied on a hand-built scheme of queues (where procedures wait their turn to execute) and callbacks (which signal when a task is complete). Version 3 takes advantage of a new JavaScript construct called a <em>promise</em>. When a procedure cannot compute a result immediately, it hands out a promise, which it then redeems when the result becomes available.</p>
<p>Wait, there’s more! MathJax is not just a TeX system. It also accepts input written in MathML, a dialect of XML specialized for mathematical notation. Indeed, the internal language of MathJax is based on MathML. And MathJax can also be configured to handle <a href="http://asciimath.org/">AsciiMath</a>, a cute markup language that aims to make even the raw form of an expression readable. Think of it as math with emoticons: Type <code>`oo`</code> and you’ll get \(\infty\), or <code>`:-`</code> for \(\div\).</p>
<p>MathJax also provides an extensive suite of tools for accessibility. Visually impaired readers can have an equation read aloud. As I learned at the January Joint Math Meetings, there are even provisions for generating Braille output—but that’s a subject that deserves a post of its own.</p>
<hr />
<p>When I first encountered MathJax, I saw it as a marvel, but I also considered it a workaround or stopgap. Reading a short document that includes a single equation entails downloading the entire MathJax program, which can be much larger than the document itself. And you need to download it all again for every other mathy document (unless your browser cache hangs onto a copy). What an appalling waste of bandwidth. </p>
<p>Several alternatives seemed more promising as a long-term solution. The best approach, it seemed to me then, was to have support for mathematical notation built into the browser. Modern browsers handle images, audio, video, SVG, animations—why not math? But it hasn’t happened. Firefox and Safari have limited support for MathML; none of the browsers I know are equipped to deal with TeX.</p>
<p>Another strategy that once seemed promising was the browser plugin. A plugin could offer the same capabilities as MathJax, but you would download and install it only once. This sounds like a good deal for readers, but it’s not so attractive for the author of web content. If there are multiple plugins in circulation, they are sure to have quirks, and you need to accommodate all of them. Furthermore, you need some sort of fallback plan for those who have not installed a plugin.</p>
<p>Still another option is to run MathJax on the server, rather than sending the whole program to the browser. The document arrives with TeX or MathML already converted to HTML/CSS or SVG for display. This is the preferred modus operandi for several large websites, most notably Wikipedia. I’ve considered it for bit-player, but it has a drawback: Running on the server, MathJax cannot provide the kind of on-demand typesetting seen in the demos above.</p>
<p>As the years go by, I am coming around to the view that MathJax is not just a useful stopgap while we wait for the right thing to come along; it’s quite a good approximation to the right thing. As the author of a web page, I get to write mathematics in a familiar and well-tested notation, and I can expect that any reader with an up-to-date browser will see output that’s much like what I see on my own screen. At the same time, the reader also has control over how the math is rendered, via the context menu. And the program offers accessibility features that I could never match on my own.</p>
<p>To top it off, the software is open-source—freely available to everyone. That is not just an economic advantage but also a social one. The project has a community that stands ready to fix bugs, listen to suggestions and complaints, offer help and advice. Without that resource, I would still be struggling with the hitches and hiccups described above.</p></div>

<div class="content">
The refutation system ${Res}_R({PC}_d)$ is a natural extension of resolution refutation system such that it operates with disjunctions of degree $d$ polynomials over ring $R$ with boolean variables. For $d=1$, this system is called ${Res}_R({lin})$. Based on properties of $R$, ${Res}_R({lin})$ systems can be too strong to prove lower bounds for CNFs with current methods. The reachable goal might be proving lower bounds for ${Res}_R({lin})$ when $R$ is a finite field such as $\mathbb{F}_2$. Interestingly, ${Res}_{\mathbb{F}_2}({lin})$ is also fairly strong, and there is no known nontrivial lower bound for it, but for ${Res}^*_R({lin})$ (tree-like ${Res}_R({lin})$) we know exponential lower bounds for every finite field.
 For the stronger systems ${Res}_R({PC}_d)$ and ${Res}_R^*({PC}_d)$ for $d&gt;1$ on finite ring $R$, there is no known lower bounds till now. In this paper we will investigate these refutation systems and make some progress toward understanding these systems, including the case $d=1$. We prove a size-width relation for ${Res}_R({PC}_d)$ and ${Res}^*_R({PC}_d)$ for every finite ring $R$. This relation is proved by a new idea to reduce the problem to the original Ben-Sasson and Wigderson size-width relation for ${Res}$ and ${Res}^*$ using extension variables. As a by product, we get the following new lower bounds for every finite field $\mathbb{F}$:
(1) We prove the first nontrivial lower bounds for ${Res}_\mathbb{F}({PC}_d)$ for fixed $d$: a nearly quadratic lower bounds for mod $q$ Tseitin formulas ($char(\mathbb{F})\neq q$) for suitable graphs.
(2) We also prove superpolynomial and exponential lower bounds for ${Res}^*_\mathbb{F}({PC}_{d})$ where $d$ is not too large with respect to $n$ for the following principles:
 (a) mod $q$ Tseitin formulas ($char(\mathbb{F})\neq q$),
 (b) Random $k$-CNFs.</div>

<p>Besides unimaginable suffering and horror, the Black Death of the 1340’s also brought increased wages and better living standards.  It came back, among other times, in 1665.  Then like now, universities closed and students went home.  Among them was Newton, who spent his time alone in the countryside thus:</p>



<p><strong>In the beginning of the year 1665 I found the method of approximating series and the rule for reducing any dignity [power] of any binomial into such a series. The same year in May I found the method of tangents of Gregory and Slusius, and in November had the direct method of fluxions and the next year [1666] in January had the theory of colours and in May following I had entrance into the inverse method of fluxions. And the same year I began to think of gravity extending to the orb of the moon … All this was in the two plague years of 1665 and 1666, for in those days I was in the prime of my age for invention and minded Mathematics and Philosophy more than at any time since.</strong></p>



<p>Today’s Coronavirus pandemic is probably the first in history that’s been fought with telecommunication.  People are advised to work remotely, and many universities are switching to online courses.  Besides the suffering and horror, it is also an opportunity <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2020/02/18/working-remotely-will-be-the-most-significant-transformation-since-agriculture/">to realize that many things can be done remotely just as well if not better, change our lifestyle, and stop polluting the environment.</a></p></div>

<p>
Robert Dorfman was a professor of political economy at Harvard University, who helped create the notion of group testing. </p>
<p>
Today Ken and I discuss this notion and its possible application to the current epidemic crisis. We also discuss other mathematical aspects that have clear and immediate value.<br />
<span id="more-16778"></span></p>
<p>
The novel coronavirus (and its disease <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019">COVID-19</a>) is the nasty issue we all face today. I live in New York City and can see the reduced foot traffic every day. The issue is discussed every minute on the news. I hope you are all safe, and well. But we are all worried about this. </p>
<p>
The point of group testing is that it can reduce the number of tests needed to find out who has the virus. I assume that we are not using Dorfman’s idea because it does not apply to today’s testing. But it seems like it could fit. One issue is the need for more individual testing kits. As we write this, the US is still well short of the needed supply of kits. Are there situations where group testing can still help economize?</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Group Testing </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Dorfman created the notion of <em>group testing</em> in 1943. You could say he was driven by the need to test light bulbs:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/test.png"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/test.png?w=300&amp;h=188" alt="" width="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-16781" height="188" /></a></p>
<p>As Wikipedia group-testing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_testing">article</a> explains:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> [Suppose] one is searching for a broken bulb among six light bulbs. Here, the first three are connected to a power supply, and they light up (A). This indicates that the broken bulb must be one of the last three (B). If instead the bulbs did not light up, one could be sure that the broken bulb was among the first three. Continuing this procedure can locate the broken bulb in no more than three tests, compared to a maximum of six tests if the bulbs are checked individually. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Okay, Dorfman’s motivation was not light bulbs. It was testing soldiers during WWII for a certain disease, that will go unnamed. This type of testing reduced the number of blood samples needed. What was analogous to connecting groups of light bulbs into one circuit was combining portions of individual blood samples into one sample. If it tested negative then that entire group could be dismissed without further testing.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Fewer Kits </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The point of using group testing is made stark when you think about recent issues with cruise ships. On one ship there were around <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3500%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{3500}" class="latex" title="{3500}" /> passengers who were eventually found to be almost all okay. I believe only <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" /> were infected. This could have been checked by group testing with many fewer than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3500%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{3500}" class="latex" title="{3500}" /> tests. </p>
<p>
According to the current outbreak <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html">maps</a>, known <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html#us">cases</a> in the US are still fairly sparse. Those in New York are mainly in the city, Westchester, and along the Hudson River to Albany. Let’s say we wish assurance that all non-virus related admits to a hospital are free of the virus. Can group testing apply?</p>
<p>
The original version of group testing would apply if it were deemed mandatory that all new admits give a blood sample. Some kinds of coronavirus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_testing">test kits</a> use blood samples. Taking blood samples might however be as costly and intrusive as having the individual tests to begin with. There are other kinds of tests involving taking swabs, but it is not apparent whether those samples can be combined at scale as readily as blood samples can.</p>
<p>
At least the <em>idea</em> of group testing has interesting connections to other parts of theory. Here is a 2000 <a href="https://www.cs.umn.edu/sites/cs.umn.edu/files/tech_reports/00-007.pdf">survey</a> by Ken’s former Buffalo colleague Hung Ngo with his PhD advisor, Ding-Zhu Du, where the application is to large scale screening of DNA samples. Hung and Ken’s colleague Atri Rudra taught a <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~hungngo/classes/2011/709/">course</a> in Buffalo on group testing in relation to <em>compressed sensing</em>. More recent is a 2015 <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7308980">paper</a> that tries to solve problems of counting the number of positive cases, not just whether they exist. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Other Mathematical Effects </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
As we write, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has just declared a cap of 500 attendees for any assembly. This is forcing the suspension of Broadway shows among many other activities. Yesterday the entire SUNY system joined numerous other institutions in moving to distance-only learning after this week.  </p>
<p>
The cap is based on the likelihood of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" /> persons including someone who is already infected. That likelihood in turn is based on the density of known cases and what is known about the proportion of unknown to known cases. The virus has a long (two weeks) incubation time during which it is contagious but not symptomatic.</p>
<p>
Here is a graph from a PSA <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/03/covid-19-event-risk-assessment-planner.html">item</a> posted just today by Alex Tabarrok for the <em>Marginal Revolution</em> blog (note that the calculations are by <a href="https://biosciences.gatech.edu/people/joshua-weitz">Joshua</a> <a href="http://ecotheory.biology.gatech.edu/">Weitz</a> of Georgia Tech):</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/riskassessment-1024x776-1.jpg"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/riskassessment-1024x776-1.jpg?w=550&amp;h=425" alt="" width="550" class="aligncenter wp-image-16782" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>
The <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />-axis is the number of cases (in proportion to the US on the whole) and the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" />-axis is the group size. Which axis is more important—has more effect on the danger? Tabarrok notes:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Now here is the most important point. It’s the size of the group, not the number of carriers that most drives the result. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
This involves comparing two partial derivatives. The <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/03/covid-19-event-risk-assessment-planner.html">item</a> gives a brief worked-out example without using calculus. </p>
<p>
I, Ken, have been connected this week to another example. I was statistically monitoring the World Senior Team Chess Championship, which began last Friday in Prague. Almost 500 players in teams of 4 or 5 players took part. Initially the players were roughly evenly divided between two halls. Effective Tuesday, a cap of 100 was declared for the Czech Republic, so more playing rooms were found and spectators were banned. Today, however, after an update on the density of cases in the Czech Republic, the cap was lowered to 30 effective tomorrow.  Thus the tournament was forced to finish today, two rounds earlier than planned. Even though chess events have a lower size footprint than all of the spectator sports whose seasons have been suspended in recent days, the growth of the outbreak is making cancellation the only reasonable policy for all but the smallest events.</p>
<p>
The main purpose of these and other <em>social isolation</em> measures is to flatten out the growth of cases. The target is not just to contain the outbreak but also to stay below the number of serious cases that our treatment systems can bear at once. Here is one of numerous versions of a <a href="https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/wellness-prevention/flattening-curve-for-covid-19-what-does-it-mean-and-how-can-you-help">graphic</a> that is being widely circulated:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/coronavirus_flattening_curve_1.jpg"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/coronavirus_flattening_curve_1.jpg?w=400&amp;h=223" alt="" width="400" class="aligncenter wp-image-16783" height="223" /></a></p>
<p>
The graphic is not necessarily talking about reducing the number of cases <em>total</em>. The area under both curves is the same. A sentence in accompanying article—</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If individuals and communities take steps to slow the virus’s spread, that means the number of cases of COVID-19 will stretch out across a longer period of time. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
—seems to imply that “the number of cases” is the same in both scenarios, but stretched out over time in the latter. The point is how the stretching keeps the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />-value bounded.  <b>Update 3/15:</b> To complete the thoughts here, we <i>should</i> be talking about reducing the number of cases—see <a href="https://medium.com/@joschabach/flattening-the-curve-is-a-deadly-delusion-eea324fe9727">this</a>.</p>
<p>
We certainly hope that isolation can reduce that number—i.e., that containment data out of Southeast Asia in particular holds true, as opposed to fears being voiced in the West that the virus will spread to a large percentage of the population over time. See charts <a href="https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca">here</a>, especially chart 7.  This tracking <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/01/22/mapping-spread-new-coronavirus/?arc404=true">map</a> has free access and is updated daily.</p>
<p>
What governs the spreading process? This is being understood via simple mathematical models of contagion, such as come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory">percolation theory</a> and its associated <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R_0}" class="latex" title="{R_0}" /> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895684/">factor</a>. Almost a month ago, the Washington Post made an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/health/coronavirus-how-epidemics-spread-and-end/">interactive</a> showing how epidemics spread according to the parameters in these models. How and whether the COVID-19 pandemic follows these models remains to be seen. Of course we hope it stays on the better side of the equations.  <b>Update 3/15:</b> This new <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/">animation</a> from the Washington Post shows how the “better side” can arise.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Is group testing a practical <em>mechanism</em> for mapping and constraining the epidemic? How can we promote the understanding of mechanisms and equations and models, not only for those shaping policy but for us who must abide by it and know why.</p>

[added note about UB and others going to online learning, added small-event qualifier about chess, clarified COVID-19 is the disease, added map link and two updates.]</p></font></font></div>
