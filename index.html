parameters $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and $k$, we construct a distance oracle that uses
$O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})^{kd}\log\varepsilon^{-1}$ space, and given a query
curve $Q$ with $k$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, returns in $\tilde{O}(kd)$ time a
$1+\varepsilon$ approximation of the discrete Fr\'echet distance between $Q$
and $P$.
</p>
<p>In addition, we construct simplifications in the streaming model, oracle for
distance queries to a sub-curve (in the static setting), and introduce the
zoom-in problem. Our algorithms work in any dimension $d$, and therefore we
generalize some useful tools and algorithms for curves under the discrete
Fr\'echet distance to work efficiently in high dimensions.

$Y$ has the rational homotopy type of an H-space. As a corollary, many

well as the associated geodesic distance, arises in a broad range of
applications across digital geometry processing, scientific computing, computer
graphics, and computer vision. Relative to Euclidean distance computation,
these tasks are complicated by the influence of curvature on the behavior of
shortest paths, as well as the fact that the representation of the domain may
itself be approximate. In spite of the difficulty of this problem, recent
literature has developed a wide variety of sophisticated methods that enable
rapid queries of geodesic information, even on relatively large models. This
survey reviews the major categories of approaches to the computation of
geodesic paths and distances, highlighting common themes and opportunities for

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Differential privacy protects against extremely strong adversaries—even ones who know the entire dataset except for one bit of information about one individual.  Since its inception, people have considered ways to relax the definition to assume a more realistic adversary.  A natural way to do so is to incorporate some distributional assumptions. That is, rather than considering a worst-case dataset, assume the dataset is drawn from some distribution and provide some form of “average-case” or “Bayesian” privacy guarantee with respect to this distribution. This is especially tempting as it is common for statistical analysis to work under distributional assumptions.</p>

<p>In this post and in a planned follow-up post, we will discuss some pitfalls of average-case or Bayesian versions of differential privacy.  To avoid keeping you in suspense:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The average-case assumptions in relaxations of differential privacy are qualitatively different to and much more brittle than the typical assumptions made about how the data is generated.</li>
  <li>Average-case relaxations do not satisfy the strong composition properties that have made differential privacy so successful.</li>
  <li>It is safer to use distributional assumptions in the accuracy analysis instead of the privacy analysis. That is, we can provide average-case utility and worst-case privacy. Recent work has shown that this model can capture most of the advantages of distributional assumptions.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will show some illustrative examples for each of these points, but we will be purposefully vague as to exactly which alternative definition we are considering, as these issues arise in a wide variety of definitions.  Our hope is not to shut down discussion of these relaxations, or to single out specific definitions as flawed.  There are specific concrete applications where average-case differential privacy might be useful, and our goal is to highlight some issues that must be carefully considered in each application.</p>

<h3 id="assumptions-about-nature-vs-assumptions-about-the-adversary">Assumptions about nature vs. assumptions about the adversary?</h3>

<p>In any reasonable definition of privacy, we have to think about whom we are hiding sensitive information from.  This person—“the adversary”—could be a stranger, a close friend, a relative, a corporation we do business with, or the government, and who they are affects what information they have access to and what defenses are appropriate.   How the adversary can access the private system defines the <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/\trustmodels">trust model</a>. Distributional assumptions correspond to the adversary’s side information.  Our key point is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assumptions incorporated into the definition of privacy are assumptions about the adversary and these are qualitatively different from assumptions about “nature,” which is the process that generates the data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, suppose an employer learns that two of its employees have expensive medical conditions. On its own, this information does not identify those employees and this privacy intuition could be formalized via distributional assumptions. But these distributional assumptions will break if the employer later receives some side information. For example, the other healthy employees may voluntarily disclose their medical status or the employer may find out that, before you were hired, that number was only one. (Incidentally, this is an example of a failure of composition, which we will discuss in another post.)</p>

<p>This example illustrates how assumptions about the adversary that might seem reasonable in a vacuum can be invalidated by context. Plus, assumptions about the adversary can be invalidated by <em>future</em> side information, and you can’t retract a privacy leak once it happens the way you can a medical study. So assumptions about the adversary are much less future-proof than assumptions about nature.</p>

<h3 id="all-models-are-wrong-but-some-are-useful">All models are wrong, but some are useful</h3>

<p>One justification for incorporating distributional assumptions into the privacy definition is that the person using the data is often making these assumptions anyway—for example, that the data is i.i.d. Gaussian, or that two variables have some underlying linear relationship to be discovered.  So, if the assumption were false, wouldn’t we already be in trouble?  Not really.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s important to remember the old saw “all models are wrong, but some are useful.”  Some models have proven themselves useful for statistical purposes, but that does not mean they are useful as a basis for privacy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, our methods may be robust to the relatively friendly ways that nature deviates from the model, but we can’t trust adversaries to be as friendly.</p>

<p>For a toy example, suppose we model our data as coming from a normal distribution \( N(\mu,\sigma^2) \), but actually the data is collected at two different testing centers, one of which rounds its measurements to the nearest integer and the other of which provides two decimal places of precision.  This rounding makes the model wrong, but won’t significantly affect our estimate of the mean.  However, just looking at the estimate of the mean might reveal that someone in the dataset went to the second testing center, potentially compromising that person’s privacy.</p>

<p>A more natural setting where this issue arises is in dealing with <em>outliers</em> or other extreme examples, which we will discuss in the next section.</p>

<h3 id="privacy-for-outliers">Privacy for outliers</h3>

<p>The usual worst-case definition of differential privacy provides privacy for everyone, including outliers.  Although there are lots of ways to achieve differential privacy, in order to compare definitions, it will help to restrict attention to the basic approach based on calibrating noise to sensitivity:</p>

<p>Suppose we have a private dataset \( x \in \mathcal{X}^n \) containing the data of \( n \) individuals, and some real-valued query \( q : \mathcal{X}^n \to \mathbb{R} \).  The standard way to release an estimate of \( q(x) \) is to compute
\[
M(x) = q(x) + Z \cdot \sup_{\textrm{neighboring}~x’,x”} |q(x’) - q(x”)|
\]
where 
\(
\sup_{\textrm{neighboring}~x’,x”} |q(x’) - q(x”)|
\)
is called the “worst-case sensitivity” of \( q \) and \( Z \) is some noise, commonly drawn from a Laplace or Gaussian distribution.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the worst-case sensitivity may be large or even infinite for basic statistics of interest, such as the mean \( q(x) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i} x_i \) of unbounded real values.  There are a variety of differentially private algorithms for addressing this problem,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> but that is not what this post is about.  It’s tempting to, instead, try to scale the noise to some notion of “average-case sensitivity,” with the goal of satisfying some average-case version of differential privacy.  For example, suppose the data is drawn from some normal distribution \( N(\mu,\sigma^2) \) and the neighboring datasets \( x', x'' \) are each \( n \) i.i.d. samples from this distribution, but differing on exactly one random sample.  Then the worst-case sensitivity of the mean is infinite:
\[
\sup_{\textrm{neighboring}~x’,x”} |q(x’) - q(x”)| = \infty,
\]
but the average-sensitivity is proportional to \(1/n\):
\[
\mathbb{E}_{\textrm{neighboring}~x’, x”}(|q(x’) - q(x”)|) \approx \frac{\sigma}{n}.
\]
Thus, under an average-case privacy guarantee, we can estimate the mean with very little noise.</p>

<p>But what happens to privacy if this assumption fails, perhaps because of outliers?  Imagine computing the average wealth of a subset of one hundred Amazon employees who test positive for COVID-19, and discovering that it’s over one billion dollars.  Maybe Jeff Bezos isn’t feeling well?<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Yes, this example is a little contrived, since you probably shouldn’t have computed the empirical mean of such skewed data anyway. But, if this fact leaks out, you can’t just go back in time and truncate the data or compute the median instead. Privacy tends to be high-stakes both because of the potential consequences of a breach and the inability to retract or correct a privacy violation after it is discovered.</p>

<p>In the next section we’ll see a slightly more complex example where average-case privacy / average-case sensitivity fails to protect privacy even when the distributional assumptions hold.</p>

<h3 id="example-pairwise-correlations-and-linear-regression">Example: pairwise correlations and linear regression</h3>

<p>Suppose our dataset \( X \) is a matrix \( \{-1,+1\}^{n \times (d+1)} \) where each row \( X_i \) corresponds to one person’s data and each column corresponds to one feature.  For simplicity, let’s suppose our distributional assumption is that the dataset is completely uniform—each bit is sampled independently and uniformly from \( \{-1,+1\} \).  We’ll think of the first \( d \) columns as “features” and the last column as a “secret label.”</p>

<p>First, consider the set of pairwise correlations between each feature and the secret label:
\[
q_j(X) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} X_{i,j} X_{i,d+1}
\]
for \( j = 1,\dots,d \).  Note that \( q_j(X) \) has mean 0 and variance \( n \) under our distributional model of the data.</p>

<p>Now, suppose we have a weight vector \( w \in \mathbb{R}^{d} \) and want to estimate the weighted average of correlations
\[
q(X) = \sum_{j = 1}^{d} w_j q_j(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{d} w_{j} X_{i,j} X_{i,d+1}
\]
This statistic may look a little odd, but it’s pretty close to computing the average squared error of the linear predictor \( \hat X_{i,d+1} = \sum_{j=1}^{d} w_j X_{i,j} \) given by the weight vector \( w \), which is a natural thing to estimate.</p>

<p>The worst-case sensitivity of \(q\) is proportional to \( \|w\|_1 \).<br />
However, it’s not too hard to show that, under our distributional model, the average-case sensitivity is much lower; it is proportional to \( \| w \|_2 \).  Thus, using average-case privacy may allow us to add significantly less noise.</p>

<p>What could go wrong here?  Well, we’ve implicitly assumed that the weights \( w \) are independent of the data \( X \).  That is, the person specifying the weights has no knowledge of the data itself, only its distribution.  Suppose the weights are specified by an adversary who has learned the \( d \) features of the first individual (although there is nothing special about considering the first individual), who sets the weights to \(w = (X_{1,1},\dots,X_{1,d}) \).  Another calculation shows that, in this case, <em>even when our model of the data is exactly correct</em>, the query \( q(X) \) has mean \( d \cdot X_{1,d+1} \) and standard deviation approximately \( \sqrt{nd} \).  Thus, if \( d \gg n \) we can confidently determine the secret label \( X_{1,d+1} \)  of the first individual from the value \( q(X) \).  Moreover, adding noise of standard deviation \( \ll d \) will not significantly affect the adversary’s ability to learn the secret label.  But, earlier, we argued that average-case sensitivity is proportional to \( \|w \|_2 = \sqrt{d} \), so this form of average-case privacy fails to protect a user’s data in this scenario!  Note that adding noise proportional to \( \|w\|_1 = d \) would satisfy (worst-case) differential privacy and would thwart this adversary.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What went wrong is that the data satisfied our assumptions, but the adversary’s beliefs about the data did not!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The set of reasonable distributions to consider for the adversary’s beliefs may look very different from the set of reasonable distributions to consider for your analysis of the data.  You may think that it’s not reasonable for the attacker to choose this weight vector \( w \) containing a lot of prior information about an individual, but assuming that the attacker cannot obtain or specify such a vector is very different from assuming that the data is uniform, and requires its own justification.</p>

<p>Before wrapping up, let’s just make a couple more observations about this example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This attack is pretty robust. The assumption that the data is uniform with independent features can be relaxed significantly.  It’s also not necessary for the adversary to exactly know all the features of the first user, all we need is for the weights to have correlation \( \gg \sqrt{nd} \) with the features.  For example, if the dataset is genomic data, having the data of a relative might suffice.</li>
  <li>This problem isn’t specific to high-dimensional data with \( d \gg n \).  If we allow more general types of “queries”, then a similar attack is possible when there are only \( d \approx \log n \) features.</li>
  <li>To make this example as crisp as possible, we allowed an adversarial data analyst to specify the weight vector \( w \).  You might think examples like this can’t arise if the algorithm designer specifies all of the queries internally, but ensuring that requires great care (as we’ll see in our upcoming post about composition).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>As we have discussed, the main issue that arises in average-case or Bayesian versions of differential privacy is that we must make strong assumptions about the adversary. A simple distributional assumption about the data, which may be entirely reasonable for statistical analysis, entails assuming a naïve adversary with essentially no side information, which is not reasonable from a privacy perspective.</p>

<p>In a future post, we will discuss <em>composition</em>, which is a key robustness property and really the secret to differential privacy’s success.  As we’ll see, average-case versions of differential privacy do not enjoy strong composition properties the way worst-case differential privacy does, which makes them much harder to deploy.</p>

<p>Incorporating assumptions about the adversary into the privacy guarantee requires great care; and it is safest to make fewer assumptions, which quickly pushes us towards the worst-case definition of differential privacy. Nevertheless, assumptions about the adversary are often made implicitly and it is worth studying how to make these explicit.</p>

<p>So, is there are role for distributional assumptions in differential privacy? Yes! Although we’ve discussed the pitfalls of making the <em>privacy guarantee</em> contingent on distributional assumptions, none of these pitfalls apply to making the <em>utility guarantee</em> contingent on distributional assumptions, as is normally done in statistical analysis.  In recent years, this combination—worst-case privacy, average-case utility—has been fruitful, and seems to allow many of the benefits that average-case privacy definitions seek to capture.  For example, recent work has shown that worst-case differential privacy permits accurate mean and covariance estimation of unbounded data under natural modeling assumptions <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03908" title="Vishesh Karwa, Salil Vadhan.

We obtain lower bounds on the minimax sample complexity of interactive
protocols under local information constraints, a broad family of resource
constraints which captures communication constraints, local differential
privacy, and noisy binary queries as special cases. We focus on the inference
tasks of learning (density estimation) and identity testing (goodness-of-fit)
for discrete distributions under total variation distance, and establish
general lower bounds that take into account the local constraints modeled as a
channel family.
</p>
<p>Our main technical contribution is an approach to handle the correlation that
builds due to interactivity and quantifies how effectively one can exploit this
correlation in spite of the local constraints. Using this, we fill gaps in some
prior works and characterize the optimal sample complexity of learning and
testing discrete distributions under total variation distance, for both
communication and local differential privacy constraints. Prior to our work,
this was known only for the problem of testing under local privacy constraints
(Amin, Joseph, and Mao (2020); Berrett and Butucea (2020)). Our results show
that interactivity does not help for learning or testing under these two
constraints. Finally, we provide the first instance of a natural family of
"leaky query" local constraints under which interactive protocols strictly
outperform the noninteractive ones for distribution testing.

have been branching and cutting planes. Recently, several authors have
developed core point methods for solving symmetric integer linear programs
(ILPs). An integer point is called a core point if its orbit polytope is
lattice-free. It has been shown that for symmetric ILPs, optimizing over the
set of core points gives the same answer as considering the entire space.
Existing core point techniques rely on the number of core points (or
equivalence classes) being finite, which requires special symmetry groups. In
this paper we develop some new methods for solving symmetric ILPs (based on
outer approximations of core points) that do not depend on finiteness but are
more efficient if the group has large disjoint cycles in its set of generators.

game with payoffs in $[-1,1]$ is PPAD-hard (under randomized reductions) even
in the smoothed analysis setting, smoothing with noise of constant magnitude.
This gives a strong negative answer to conjectures of Spielman and Teng [ST06]
and Cheng, Deng, and Teng [CDT09].
</p>
<p>In contrast to prior work proving PPAD-hardness after smoothing by noise of
magnitude $1/\operatorname{poly}(n)$ [CDT09], our smoothed complexity result is
not proved via hardness of approximation for Nash equilibria. This is by
necessity, since Nash equilibria can be approximated to constant error in
quasi-polynomial time [LMM03]. Our results therefore separate smoothed
complexity and hardness of approximation for Nash equilibria in two-player
games.
</p>
<p>The key ingredient in our reduction is the use of a random zero-sum game as a
gadget to produce two-player games which remain hard even after smoothing. Our
analysis crucially shows that all Nash equilibria of random zero-sum games are
far from pure (with high probability), and that this remains true even after
smoothing.

distributions over a discrete space $\Omega$ with probability mass function of
the form $\mu^\Omega_\beta(x) \propto e^{\beta H(x)}$ for $\beta$ in an
interval $[\beta_{\min}, \beta_{\max}]$ and $H(x) \in \{0 \} \cup [1, n]$. The
\emph{partition function} is the normalization factor
$Z(\beta)=\sum_{x\in\Omega}e^{\beta H(x)}$.
</p>
<p>Two important parameters of these distributions are the partition ratio $q =
\log \tfrac{Z(\beta_{\max})}{Z(\beta_{\min})}$ and the counts $c_x =
|H^{-1}(x)|$ for each value $x$. These are correlated with system parameters in
a number of physical applications and sampling algorithms. Our first main
result is to estimate the values $c_x$ using roughly $\tilde O(
\frac{q}{\varepsilon^2})$ samples for general Gibbs distributions and $\tilde
O( \frac{n^2}{\varepsilon^2} )$ samples for integer-valued distributions
(ignoring some second-order terms and parameters), and we show this is optimal
up to logarithmic factors. We illustrate with improved algorithms for counting
connected subgraphs and perfect matchings in a graph.
</p>
<p>As a key subroutine, we estimate the partition function $Z$ using $\tilde
O(\frac{q}{\varepsilon^2})$ samples for general Gibbs distributions and $\tilde
O(\frac{n^2}{\varepsilon^2})$ samples for integer-valued distributions. We
construct a data structure capable of estimating $Z(\beta)$ for \emph{all}
values $\beta$, without further samples. This improves over a prior algorithm
of Kolmogorov (2018) which computes the single point estimate $Z(\beta_{\max})$
using $\tilde O(\frac{q}{\varepsilon^2})$ samples. We show matching lower
bounds, demonstrating that this complexity is optimal as a function of $n$ and
$q$ up to logarithmic terms.

These days, all big exchanges use computer algorithms to match buy and sell
requests and these algorithms must abide by certain regulatory guidelines. For
example, market regulators enforce that a matching produced by exchanges should
be fair, uniform and individual rational. To verify these properties of trades,
we first formally define these notions in a theorem prover and then develop
many important results about matching demand and supply. Finally, we use this
framework to verify properties of two important classes of double sided auction
mechanisms. All the definitions and results presented in this paper are
completely formalized in the Coq proof assistant without adding any additional

solved in $O^*(2^n)$ time, as shown by Bj\"orklund, Husfeldt and Koivisto in
2009. For $k=3,4$, better algorithms are known for the $k$-coloring problem.
$3$-coloring can be solved in $O(1.4^n)$ time (Beigel and Eppstein, 2005) and
$4$-coloring can be solved in $O(1.8^n)$ time (Fomin, Gaspers and Saurabh,
2007). Surprisingly, for $k&gt;4$ no improvements over the general $O^*(2^n)$ are
known. We show that both $5$-coloring and $6$-coloring can also be solved in
$O\left(\left(2-\varepsilon\right)^n\right)$ time for some $\varepsilon&gt;0$.
Moreover, we obtain an exponential improvement for $k$-coloring for any
constant $k$ for a very large family of graphs. In particular, for any
constants $k,\Delta,\alpha&gt;0$, $k$-coloring for graphs with at least
$\alpha\cdot n$ vertices of degree at most $\Delta$ can be solved in
$O\left(\left(2-\varepsilon\right)^n\right)$ time, for some $\varepsilon =

can solve $k$-coloring exponentially faster than $O^*(2^n)$ for sparse graphs.

classical resource to generate classical correlations shared by two separated
players. Our motivation is twofold. First, in the near future the scale of
quantum information processing is quite limited, and when quantum resource
available is not sufficient for certain tasks, a possible way to strengthen the
capability of quantum schemes is introducing extra classical resource. We
analyze the mathematical structures of these hybrid protocols, and characterize
the relation between the amount of quantum resource and classical resource
needed. Second, a fundamental open problem in communication complexity theory
is to describe the advantages of sharing prior quantum entanglement over
sharing prior randomness, which is still widely open. It turns out that our
quantum and classical hybrid protocols provide new insight into this important
problem.

<p><b>Authors: </b>Nikolay Vereshchagin <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10658">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>We consider tilings of the plane by two prototiles which are right triangles.
They are called the small and the large tiles. The small tile is similar to the
large tile with some similarity coefficient $\psi$. The large tile can be cut
into two pieces so that one piece is a small tile and the other one is similar
to the small tile with the same similarity coefficient $\psi$. Using this cut
we define in a standard way the substitution scheme, in which the large tile is
replaced by a large and a small tile and the small tile is replaced by a large
tile. To every substitution of this kind, there corresponds a family of the
so-called substitution tilings of the plane in the sense of [C.
Goodman-Strauss, Matching Rules and Substitution Tilings, Annals of Mathematics
147 (1998) 181-223]. All tilings in this family are non-periodic. It was shown
in the paper [N. Vereshchagin. Aperiodic Tilings by Right Triangles. In: Proc.
of DCFS 2014, LNCS vol. 8614 (2014) 29--41] that this family of substitution
tilings is not an SFT. This means that looking at a given tiling trough a
bounded window, we cannot determine whether that tiling belongs to the family
or not, however large the size of the window is.
</p>
<p>In the present paper, we prove that this family of substitution tilings is
sofic. This means that we can color the prototiles ina finite number of colors
and define some local rules for colored prototiles so that the following holds.
For any tiling from the family, we can color its tiles so that the resulting
tiling (by colored tiles) satisfies local rules. And conversely, for any tiling
of the plane satisfying the local rules, by removing colors we obtain a tiling
from the family. Besides, the considered substitution can be generalized to
colored tiles so that the family of substitution tilings for the resulting
substitution coincides with the family of tilings satisfying our local rules.

prefix-sum, as small as possible for a given target norm.
</p>
<p>We consider some of the most well-known problems in discrepancy theory in the
above online stochastic setting, and give algorithms that match the known
offline bounds up to $\mathsf{polylog}(nT)$ factors. This substantially
generalizes and improves upon the previous results of Bansal, Jiang, Singla,
and Sinha (STOC' 20). In particular, for the Koml\'{o}s problem where
$\|v_t\|_2\leq 1$ for each $t$, our algorithm achieves $\tilde{O}(1)$
discrepancy with high probability, improving upon the previous
$\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ bound. For Tusn\'{a}dy's problem of minimizing the
discrepancy of axis-aligned boxes, we obtain an $O(\log^{d+4} T)$ bound for
arbitrary distribution over points. Previous techniques only worked for product
distributions and gave a weaker $O(\log^{2d+1} T)$ bound. We also consider the
Banaszczyk setting, where given a symmetric convex body $K$ with Gaussian
measure at least $1/2$, our algorithm achieves $\tilde{O}(1)$ discrepancy with
respect to the norm given by $K$ for input distributions with sub-exponential
tails.
</p>
<p>Our key idea is to introduce a potential that also enforces constraints on
how the discrepancy vector evolves, allowing us to maintain certain
anti-concentration properties. For the Banaszczyk setting, we further enhance
this potential by combining it with ideas from generic chaining. Finally, we
also extend these results to the setting of online multi-color discrepancy.

edges arrive over time. When an edge $e_t = (u_t, v_t)$ arrives at time step
$t$, the algorithm must orient the edge either as $v_t \rightarrow u_t$ or $u_t
\rightarrow v_t$, with the objective of minimizing the maximum discrepancy of
any vertex, i.e., the absolute difference between its in-degree and out-degree.
Edges correspond to pairs of persons wanting to ride together, and orienting
denotes designating the driver. The discrepancy objective then corresponds to
every person driving close to their fair share of rides they participate in.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we design efficient algorithms which can maintain
polylog$(n,T)$ maximum discrepancy (w.h.p) over any sequence of $T$ arrivals,
when the arriving edges are sampled independently and uniformly from any given
graph $G$. This provides the first polylogarithmic bounds for the online
(stochastic) carpooling problem. Prior to this work, the best known bounds were
$O(\sqrt{n \log n})$-discrepancy for any adversarial sequence of arrivals, or
$O(\log\!\log n)$-discrepancy bounds for the stochastic arrivals when $G$ is
the complete graph.
</p>
<p>The technical crux of our paper is in showing that the simple greedy
algorithm, which has provably good discrepancy bounds when the arriving edges
are drawn uniformly at random from the complete graph, also has polylog
discrepancy when $G$ is an expander graph. We then combine this with known
expander-decomposition results to design our overall algorithm.

disjoint paths problem. Achieving tractable results has usually required
focusing on relaxations such as: (i) to allow some bounded edge congestion in
solutions, (ii) to only consider the unit weight (cardinality) setting, (iii)
to only require fractional routability of the selected demands (the
all-or-nothing flow setting). For the general form (no congestion, general
weights, integral routing) even the case of unit capacity trees which are stars
generalizes the maximum matching problem for which Edmonds provided an exact
algorithm. For general capacitated trees, Garg, Vazirani, Yannakakis showed the
problem is APX-Hard and Chekuri, Mydlarz, Shepherd provided a
$4$-approximation. This is essentially the only setting where a constant
approximation is known for the general form of \textsc{edp}. We extend their
result by giving a constant-factor approximation algorithm for general-form
\textsc{edp} in outerplanar graphs. A key component for the algorithm is to
find a \textsc{single-tree} $O(1)$ cut approximator for outerplanar graphs.
Previously $O(1)$ cut approximators were only known via distributions on trees
and these were based implicitly on the results of Gupta, Newman, Rabinovich and
Sinclair for distance tree embeddings combined with results of Anderson and
Feige.

bins of arbitrary capacities, and a weight for each of the items. An assignment
for the constraint is an allocation of subsets of items to the bins, such that
the total weight of items assigned to each bin is bounded by the bin capacity.
We study modular (linear) and submodular maximization problems subject to a
constant number of (i.e., $d$-resource) multiple knapsack constraints, in which
a solution is a subset of items, along with an assignment of the selected items
for each of the $d$ multiple knapsack constraints.
</p>
<p>Our results include a {\em polynomial time approximation scheme} for modular
maximization with a constant number of multiple knapsack constraints and a
matroid constraint, thus generalizing the best known results for the classic
{\em multiple knapsack problem} as well as {\em d-dimensional knapsack}, for
any $d \geq 2$. We further obtain a tight $(1-e^{-1}-\epsilon)$-approximation
for monotone submodular optimization subject to a constant number of multiple
knapsack constraints and a matroid constraint, and a
$(0.385-\epsilon)$-approximation for non-monotone submodular optimization
subject to a constant number of multiple knapsack constraints. At the heart of
our algorithms lies a novel representation of a multiple knapsack constraint as
a polytope. We consider this key tool as a main technical contribution of this
paper.

convergence of the empirical average to Nash equilibrium in symmetric bimatrix

   Models and Code
</a>
<br /></p>

<p><i>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08489">latest paper</a>, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/">Microsoft Research</a>, we explore adversarial
robustness as an avenue for training computer vision models with more transferrable
features. We find that robust models outperform their standard counterparts on
a variety of transfer learning tasks.</i></p>

<h2 id="what-is-transfer-learning">What is transfer learning?</h2>

<p>Transfer learning is a paradigm where one leverages information
from a “source” task to better solve another “target” task. Particularly when there is little training data or compute available for solving the target
task, transfer learning provides a simple and efficient way to obtain performant
machine learning models.</p>

<p>Transfer learning has already proven its utility in many ML contexts. In natural language processing, for example, one can leverage language models pre-trained on large
text corpora to beat state-of-the-art performance on
tasks like query answering, entity recognition or part-of-speech classification.</p>

<p>In our work we focus on computer vision; in this context, a standard—and
remarkably successful—transfer learning pipeline is “ImageNet pre-training.”
This pipeline starts with a deep neural network trained on the <a href="http://image-net.org">ImageNet-1K</a>
dataset, and then refines this pre-trained model for a target task. The target task can range
from classification of smaller datasets (e.g., <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">CIFAR</a>) to more complex
tasks like object detection (e.g., <a href="http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/">VOC</a>).</p>

<p>Although there are many ways in which one can refine a pre-trained model, we
will restrict our attention to the two most popular methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Fixed-feature</strong>: In fixed-feature transfer learning, we replace the final
(linear) layer of the neural network with a new layer that has the correct
number of outputs for the target task. Then, keeping the rest of the layers
<em>fixed</em>, we train the newly replaced layer on the target task.</li>
  <li><strong>Full-network</strong>: In full-network transfer learning, we also replace the last
layer but do not freeze any layers afterwards. Instead, we use the pre-trained
network
as a sort of “initialization,” and continue training <em>all</em> the layers on the
target task.</li>
</ul>

<p>When at least a moderate amount of data is available, full-network transfer
learning typically outperforms the fixed-feature strategy.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-we-improve-transfer-learning">How can we improve transfer learning?</h2>

<p>Although we don’t have a comprehensive understanding of what makes transfer
learning algorithms tick, there has been a long line of work focused on identifying 
factors that improve (or worsen) performance (examples include
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5774">[1]</a>,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08614">[2]</a>,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08974">[3]</a>,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08328">[4]</a>,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1792">[5]</a>).</p>

<p>By design, the pre-trained ImageNet model itself plays a major role here:
indeed, a recent study by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08974">Kornblith, Shlens, and Le</a> finds that
pre-trained models which achieve a higher ImageNet accuracy also perform better when
transferred to downstream classification tasks, with a tight linear
correspondence between ImageNet accuracy and the accuracy on the target task:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/robust-transfer-learning/ksl.png" alt="A scatter plot of ImageNet accuracy versus downstream     transfer accuracy showing the linear relation." class="bigimg" /></p>
<div class="footnote">
Reproduced from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08974">[KSL19]</a>. 
Each dot is a pre-trained model whose $x$ coordinate is given by its 
ImageNet accuracy and $y$ coordinate is given by its downstream 
accuracy on the target task (after the corresponding refinement on that task).
</div>

<p>But is improving ImageNet accuracy of the pre-trained model the <em>only</em> way to improve transfer learning performance?</p>

<p>After all, we want to obtain models that have learned broadly applicable features from the
source dataset. ImageNet accuracy likely correlates with the quality of
features that a model has learned, but may not fully describe the downstream
utility of these features.
Ultimately, the nature of learned features stems from the <em>priors</em> placed on
them during training. For example, there have been studies of the (sometimes
implicit) priors imposed by architectural components (e.g., <a href="https://dmitryulyanov.github.io/deep_image_prior">convolutional layers</a>),
<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/10618600152418584">data</a>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09071">augmentation</a>, 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00401">loss functions</a> and even
<a href="https://stats385.github.io/assets/lectures/Stanford_Donoho_class_Nov_19.pdf">gradient descent</a> on neural network training.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08489">our paper</a>, we study another prior: <em>adversarial robustness</em>.
Adversarial robustness—a rather frequent subject on this blog—refers to
model’s invariance to small (often imperceptible) perturbations of natural
inputs, called <a href="https://gradientscience.org/intro_adversarial">adversarial examples</a>.</p>

<p>Standard neural networks (i.e., trained with the goal of maximizing
accuracy) are extremely vulnerable to such adversarial examples. For example,
with just a tiny perturbation to the pig image below, a pre-trained ImageNet
classifier will predict it as an “airliner” with 99% confidence:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/images/piggie.png" alt="An adversarial example: a pig on the left which is imperceptibly perturbed to be classified as an airliner on the right." /></p>
<div class="footnote">
A "pigs-can-fly" adversarial example: The "pig" image on the left is correctly classified by a standard ML model, but its imperceptibly perturbed counterpart on the right is classified as an "airliner" with 99% confidence.
</div>

<p>Adversarial robustness is thus typically induced at training time by replacing
the standard loss minimization objective with a <em>robust optimization</em> objective
(see our <a href="https://gradientscience.org/robust_opt_pt1">post on robust optimization</a> for more background):</p>



<p>The above objective trains models to be robust to image perturbations that are
small in (pixel-wise) $\ell_2$ (Euclidean) normIn reality, an $\ell_2$ ball doesn't perfectly capture the
set of imperceptible perturbations we want models to be robust to—but robustness with respect to this fairly rudimentary notion of perturbations turns out to be already non-trivial and very helpful.. 
The parameter $\varepsilon$ is a hyperparameter
governing the intended degree of invariance of the resulting models to the
corresponding perturbations. Setting 
$\varepsilon = 0$ corresponds to standard training, and increasing $\varepsilon$
asks the model to be robust to increasingly large perturbations.
In short, the objective asks the model to minimize risk on not only the 
training datapoints but also the entire radius-$\varepsilon$
neighbourhood around them.</p>

<p><em>[A quick plug: Our <a href="https://github.com/MadryLab/robustness"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">robustness</code> Python library</a>, used for the code release of this paper, enables one to easily train and manipulate both standard and adversarially robust models.]</em></p>

<p>Although adversarial robustness has been initially studied solely through the lens of machine learning security, a line
of recent work (including some that’s been <a href="https://gradientscience.org/adv">previously</a> 
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/robust_apps">covered</a> on this blog) has begun to study
adversarially robust models in their own right, framing adversarial robustness
as a prior that forces models to learn features that are locally stable.
These works have found that on the one hand, adversarially robust models tend
to attain lower accuracy than their standardly-trained
counterparts.</p>

<p>On the other hand, recent work suggests that the feature
representations of robust models carry several advantages over those of
standard models, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12152">better-behaved</a>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09797">gradients</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08640">representation
invertibility</a>, and more <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10190">specialized
features</a>.
We’ve actually discussed some of these observations in earlier posts on this
blog—see, e.g., our posts about 
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/robust_reps">representation learning</a> and 
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/robust_apps">image synthesis</a>.</p>

<p>These desirable properties
might suggest that robust neural networks are learning better feature
representations than standard networks, which could improve transfer
performance.</p>

<h3 id="adversarial-robustness-and-transfer-learning">Adversarial robustness and transfer learning</h3>

<p>So in summary, we have standard models with high accuracy on the source task but
little (or no) robustness; and we have adversarially robust models, which are
worse in terms of ImageNet accuracy, but have the “nice”
representational properties identified and discussed by prior works. Which
models are better for transfer learning?</p>

<p>To answer this question, we trained and examined a large collection
of standard and robust ImageNet models, while grid searching over a wide range of
hyperparameters and architectures to find the best model of each type. (All
models are available for download via our <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/robust-models-transfer">code/model
release</a> and more
details on our training procedure can be found there and in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08489">our
paper</a>). We then performed transfer
learning (using both fixed-feature and full-network refinement) from each
trained model to 12 downstream classification tasks.</p>

<p>It turns out that 
adversarially robust source models fairly consistently outperform their standard counterparts in
terms of downstream accuracy. In the table below, we compare the accuracies of
the best standard model (searching over hyperparameters and
architecture) and the best robust model (searching over the
previous factors as well as robustness level $\varepsilon$):</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/robust-transfer-learning/results-table.svg" style="width: 100%;" class="bigimg" alt="Table showing that robust models     perform better than their standard counterparts." /></p>
<div class="footnote">
    The main result: Adversarially robust models outperform their standard counterparts when transferred to downstream classification tasks.
</div>

<p>This difference in performance tends to be particularly striking in the context of fixed-feature transfer learning. The following graph shows, for each architecture and
downstream classification task, the best standard model compared to the best
robust model in that setting. As we can see, adversarially robust models
improve on the performance of their standard counterparts, and the gap tends to
<em>increase</em> as networks increase in width:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/robust-transfer-learning/LogisticRegression.svg" alt="A bar chart showing that robust models improve on     standard ones even without taking the maximum over architectures." class="bigimg" /></p>
<div class="footnote">
    Adversarially robust models tend to improve over standard networks for
    individual architectures too. (An analogous graph for full-network
    transfer learning is given in Figure 3 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08489">our paper</a>.)
</div>

<p>Adversarial robustness improved downstream transfer
performance even when the target task was not a classification one. For example, the
following table compares standard and robust pre-training for use in downstream
object detection and instance segmentation:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/../assets/robust-transfer-learning/obj-det-results.svg" style="width: 80%;" class="bigimg" /></p>
<div class="footnote">
</div>

<h3 id="robustness-versus-accuracy">Robustness versus accuracy</h3>

<p>So it seems like robust models, despite being less accurate on the source task, are actually
better for transfer learning purposes. Indeed, the linear relation between
 ImageNet accuracy and transfer performance observed in prior work (see our discussion above) doesn’t seem
 to hold when the robustness parameter is varied. Compare the graphs below to the ones at the very start of this post:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/robust-transfer-learning/wide_resnet50_4_LogisticRegression.svg" class="bigimg" /></p>
<div class="footnote">
    Source-task (ImageNet) versus target (fixed-feature) accuracy for models with the same
    architecture while varying the robustness levels. Each dot is a
    WideResNet-50x4 model with $x$ coordinate given by source-task accuracy and
    $y$ coordinate given by fixed-feature transfer learning accuracy.
    Contrast the trends here with the "fixed-feature" trend in the first
    figure of this post—the linear trend depicted there largely disappears as less
    accurate but more robust models perform better in terms of transfer.
</div>

<p>How do we reconcile our observations with these trends observed by prior work?</p>

<p>We hypothesize that robustness and accuracy have <em>disentangled</em> effects on
transfer performance. That is, for a fixed level of robustness, higher
accuracy on the source task helps transfer, and for a fixed level of
accuracy, increased robustness helps transfer. Indeed, as shown below, for a
fixed level of robustness, the accuracy-transfer relation tends to hold
strongly:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/robust-transfer-learning/fixed-robustness.svg" class="bigimg" /></p>
<div class="footnote">
Even though robust models appear to break the linear
accuracy-transfer trend, this trend is actually preserved for a fixed value of
robustness. Each dot in the graph is a different architecture, trained for the same level of robustness ($\varepsilon = 3.0$). The $x$ coordinate is source task (ImageNet) accuracy, and the $y$ coordinate is the downstream accuracy on each target dataset.
</div>

<p>In addition to reconciling our results with those of prior work, these findings suggest that ongoing work on developing more accurate robust models
may have the added benefit of further improving transfer learning performance.</p>

<h3 id="other-empirical-mysteries-and-future-work">Other empirical mysteries and future work</h3>

<p>This post discussed how adversarially robust models might constitute a promising
avenue for improving transfer learning, and already often outperform standard
models in terms of downstream accuracy. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08489">our paper</a>, 
we study this phenomenon more closely: for example, we examine the effects of
model width, and we compare adversarial robustness to other notions of
robustness. We also uncover a few somewhat mysterious properties: for example,
resizing images seems to have a non-trivial effect on the relationship between
robustness and downstream accuracy.</p>

<p>Finally, while our work provides evidence that adversarially
robust computer vision models transfer better, understanding precisely <em>why</em> this is the case remains open. More broadly, the results we
observe indicate that we still do not yet fully understand (even empirically)
the ingredients that make transfer learning successful. We hope that our work
prompts an inquiry into the underpinnings of modern transfer learning.</p></div>

(All of the math in this post is summarized (without proofs) in a writeup by Erik Metz and myself which you can find <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/3apblog.pdf">here</a>. It is a pdf file so you can click on links in it to get to the papers it refers to.

If you know of others then let me know so I can add them to this post.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a sequel to <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2010/12/breakthrough-result-on-density-and-3.html">A BREAKTHROUGH result on density and 3-AP's</a> and <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/06/big-news-on-w3r.html">Big news on W(3,r)!</a><br />
<br />
For this post N is large, and all inequalites have a big-O or a big-Omega.<br />
<br />
For this post [N] is {1,...,N}<br />
<br />
Let<br />
<br />
r(N) be the least w such that if A is a subset of [N] and |A|  &gt;  w, then A has a 3-AP.<br />
<br />
There has been a long sequence of results getting smaller and smaller upper bounds on r(N).<br />
<br />
The motivation for getting these results is that if r(N) is &lt; N/(log N)^{1+\delta} with delta&gt;0 then the following holds:<br />
<br />
If sum_{x\in A} 1/x diverges then A has a 3-AP.<br />
<br />
This is the k=3 case of one of the Erdos-Turan Conjectures.<br />
<br />
Bloom and Sisack HAVE gotten N/(log N)^{1+delta} so they HAVE gotten ET k=3. Wow!<br />
<br />
1) I am NOT surprised that its true.<br />
<br />
2) I am SHOCKED and DELIGHTED that it was proven.  Shocked because the results leading up to it (see the write up referenced at the beginning of this post) seemed Zeno-like, approaching the result needed got but not getting there. Delighted because... uh, as the kids say, just cause.<br />
<br />
I've heard that k=4 really is much harder (see my comments and Gil's response on his blog post, pointed to at the beginning of this post)  and it is true that there has been far less progress on that case (the write up I pointed to at the beginning of this post says what is known). Hence I will again be <i>shocked </i>if it is proven.  So, unlike The Who (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDfAdHBtK_Q">here</a>) I CAN be fooled again. That's okay--- I will  be <i>delighted</i>. (ADDED LATER- there are more comments no Gil's website, from Thomas Bloom and Ben Green about what is likely to happen in the next 10 years.)<br />
<br />
Erdos offered a prize of $3000 for a proof that A has, for all k, a k-AP.  The prize is now $5000. After Erdos passed away Ronald Graham became the Erdos-Bank and paid out the money when people solved a problem Erdos put a bounty on. What happens now? (If I have the facts wrong and/or if you know the answer, please leave a polite and enlightening comment.)<br />

We show that testing Hamiltonicity in the bounded-degree graph model requires a linear number of queries. This refers to both the path and the cycle versions of the problem, and similar results hold also for the directed analogues.
In addition, we present an alternative proof for the known fact that testing Independent Set Size (in this model) requires a linear number of queries.</div>

In this work, we resolve the query complexity of global minimum cut problem for a graph by designing a randomized algorithm for approximating the size of minimum cut in a graph, where the graph can be accessed through local queries like \textsc{Degree}, \textsc{Neighbor}, and \textsc{Adjacency} queries.

Given $\epsilon \in (0,1)$, the algorithm with high probability outputs an estimate $\hat{t}$ satisfying the following $(1-\epsilon) t \leq \hat{t} \leq (1+\epsilon) t$, where $m$ is the number of edges in the graph and $t$ is the size of minimum cut in the graph. The expected number of local queries used by our algorithm is $\min\left\{m+n,\frac{m}{t}\right\}\mbox{poly}\left(\log n,\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph. Eden and Rosenbaum showed that $\Omega(m/t)$ many local queries are required for approximating the size of minimum cut in graphs. These two results together resolve the query complexity of the problem of estimating the size of minimum cut in graphs using local queries.

Building on the lower bound of Eden and Rosenbaum, we show that, for all $t \in \mathbb{N}$, $\Omega(m)$ local queries are required to decide if the size of the minimum cut in the graph is $t$ or $t-2$. Also, we show that, for any $t \in \mathbb{N}$, $\Omega(m)$ local queries are required to find all the minimum cut edges even if it is promised that the input graph has a minimum cut of size $t$. Both of our lower bound results are randomized, and hold even if we can make \textsc{Random Edge} query apart from local queries.</div>

Property testers are fast randomized algorithms whose task is to distinguish between inputs satisfying some predetermined property ${\cal P}$ and those that are far from satisfying it. Since these algorithms operate by inspecting a small randomly selected portion of the input, the most natural property one would like to be able to test is whether the input does not contain certain forbidden small substructures. In the setting of graphs, such a result was obtained by Alon et al., who proved that for any finite family of graphs ${\cal F}$, the property of being induced ${\cal F}$-free (i.e. not containing an induced copy of any $F \in {\cal F}$) is testable.

It is natural to ask if one can go one step further and prove that more elaborate properties involving induced subgraphs are also testable. One such generalization of the result of Alon et al. was formulated by Goldreich and Shinkar who conjectured that for any finite family of graphs ${\cal F}$, and any linear inequality involving the densities of the graphs $F \in {\cal F}$ in the input graph,
the property of satisfying this inequality can be tested in a certain restricted model of graph property testing. Our main result in this paper disproves this conjecture in the following strong form: some properties of this type are not testable even in the classical (i.e. unrestricted) model of graph property testing.

The proof deviates significantly from prior non-testability results in this area. The main idea is to use a linear inequality relating induced subgraph densities in order to encode the property of being a quasirandom graph.</div>

Anurag Agarwal and Richard Zanibbi are tenured faculty in Mathematics and Computer Science, respectively, at RIT. They partner with Clyde Lee Giles of Penn State and Douglas Oard of U.Md. on the <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/mathseer/">MathSeer</a> project. If the name reminds you of <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/">CiteSeer<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5C%2C%7D%5Ex%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{{\,}^x}" class="latex" title="{{\,}^x}" /></a>, no surprise: Giles co-originated that and still directs it.</p>

Today we note last month’s release of a major piece of MathSeer called <a href="https://mathdeck.cs.rit.edu/">MathDeck</a> and show how to have fun with it.</p>

Agarwal is a PhD graduate from Buffalo. He did his thesis in the Mathematics Department under Thomas Cusick on cryptography, but often visited Computer Science. He took part in seminars on lattice-based cryptography led by Jin-Yi Cai when he was in Buffalo and in one of mine on related topics. I also knew him socially as a housemate of Pavan Aduri, whose joint work we’ve mentioned <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/07/14/it-dont-come-easy/">here</a>. </p>

<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/mathematical-search/eulerformulamathdeck/" rel="attachment wp-att-17310"><img width="540" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/eulerformulamathdeck.jpg?w=540&amp;h=400" class="aligncenter wp-image-17310" height="400" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
Nevertheless, its default deck of “WikiCards” recognizes the attempt and includes “Euler’s Identity” as an option. Selecting the card changes the display to an immaculately typeset version. I then decided to change it to the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%5E%7Bi%5Cpi%7D+%3D+-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{e^{i\pi} = -1}" class="latex" title="{e^{i\pi} = -1}" />. <em>MathDeck</em> does not have a pixel eraser like Microsoft Paint does but allows you to delete a region after selecting it:</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/mathematical-search/eulerformulatypeset/" rel="attachment wp-att-17312"><img width="360" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/eulerformulatypeset.jpg?w=360&amp;h=190" class="aligncenter wp-image-17312" height="190" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
Selecting “trash” did not close up the space to the equals sign. I drew a minus bar at far right, but my attempts to follow with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" /> kept being interpreted as “<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />” or something worse, and the alternate form of Euler’s identity did not come up below. Finally, I restored the LaTeX-input box on the right and edited the source to read, <font size="+1"><tt>e^{i\pi} = -1</tt></font>:</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/mathematical-search/eulerformulatypeset2/" rel="attachment wp-att-17314"><img width="540" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/eulerformulatypeset2.jpg?w=540&amp;h=175" class="aligncenter wp-image-17314" height="175" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
The artifact of my hand-drawn minus sign was still at far right. I could not select and trash it even after refreshing the page. What fixed the issue was drawing something else over the squiggle and having the OCR interpret the tandem into something else, which I could then select and delete. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Superposing Forms and Associations </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I next wondered how the system would react to my trying to write Schrödinger’s equation. One challenge is that it has many forms. I chose the form given uppermost in Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodinger_equation#Equation">article</a>: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++i%5Chbar+%5Cfrac%7Bd+%7C%5CPsi%28t%29%5Crangle%7D%7Bd+t%7D+%3D+%5Chat%7BH%7D%7C%5CPsi%28t%29%5Crangle+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  i\hbar \frac{d |\Psi(t)\rangle}{d t} = \hat{H}|\Psi(t)\rangle " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  i\hbar \frac{d |\Psi(t)\rangle}{d t} = \hat{H}|\Psi(t)\rangle " /></p>
<p>To arrive at the challenge gradually, I first omitted the quantum <em>ket</em> notation, the hat on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{H}" class="latex" title="{H}" />, and the dependence on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" />. I wrote partial derivatives and lowercase <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpsi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\psi}" class="latex" title="{\psi}" />. Thus what I first tried to handwrite was: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++i%5Chbar+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+%5Cpsi%7D%7B%5Cpartial+t%7D+%3D+H%5Cpsi+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = H\psi " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = H\psi " /></p>
<p>The system jumped on my handwriting right away and I won’t report the results except to say it looked like Dada art with math symbols. One can, however, do a drawing in Paint or similar app and upload it. So I drew</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/mathematical-search/schrodingerdrawing/" rel="attachment wp-att-17315"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/schrodingerdrawing.png?w=600" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17315" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
and obtained</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/mathematical-search/schrodingerrendered/" rel="attachment wp-att-17316"><img width="360" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/schrodingerrendered.jpg?w=360&amp;h=260" class="aligncenter wp-image-17316" height="260" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
The ten cards returned (one is below the snip) have some wild but inspired associations. Handwriting Wikipedia’s form as given did not produce better results. However, I realized I could snip what appears on Wikipedia and upload that:</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/mathematical-search/schrodingersnip/" rel="attachment wp-att-17317"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/schrodingersnip.jpg?w=600" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17317" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
The result was a ghostly evocation of the equation, with LaTeX to boot:</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/mathematical-search/schrodingerdada/" rel="attachment wp-att-17318"><img width="540" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/schrodingerdada.jpg?w=540&amp;h=78" class="aligncenter wp-image-17318" height="78" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
The LaTeX output reminded me that I could enter Schrödinger’s equation in LaTeX and remove all doubt. I did the short form first. Would the system recognize it?</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/mathematical-search/schrodinger1/" rel="attachment wp-att-17319"><img width="540" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/schrodinger1.jpg?w=540&amp;h=328" class="aligncenter wp-image-17319" height="328" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
The name <em>Schrödinger</em> popped up in the eighth card at bottom center, but not the form I had typed. It has an integral and no equals sign. Of greater note, the center card called up another giant of quantum mechanics and began with exactly the left-hand side I had typed. To its left came Wolfgang Pauli with another occurrence of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%5Chbar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{i\hbar}" class="latex" title="{i\hbar}" />. None of the output had the time variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" />, however, so I put it in:</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/mathematical-search/schrodinger2/" rel="attachment wp-att-17320"><img width="540" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/schrodinger2.jpg?w=540&amp;h=349" class="aligncenter wp-image-17320" height="349" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
Bingo—the card labeled simply <em>Schrödinger Equation</em> appears at upper center. Unlike Wikipedia’s version, it includes <b>r</b> standing for other coordinates and—hence—properly uses partial derivatives. Otherwise it is exactly what my search intended to summon.</p>
<p>
I felt the real reward came in the other cards. I did not know that Hubble’s law had such a simple statement. I knew quantum mechanics takes glory in symmetries, of course, but did not know what equation would bear the definitive moniker, “Symmetry in Quantum Mechanics.” I remember as a child the fun of unstructured time in libraries where the physical card catalog was sorted by theme and one could browse adjacent ideas, as also on the shelves. </p>
<p>
Now I put in the ket notation, the hat to make <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Chat%7BH%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\hat{H}}" class="latex" title="{\hat{H}}" />, and the uppercase <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPsi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\Psi}" class="latex" title="{\Psi}" />. The latter two changes evidently moved the <em>Schrödinger Equation</em> card to the top of the deck, with <em>Pauli Equation</em> moving up behind it, but other cards completely changed:</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/mathematical-search/schrodinger3/" rel="attachment wp-att-17321"><img width="540" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/schrodinger3.jpg?w=540&amp;h=349" class="aligncenter wp-image-17321" height="349" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
I had not known the term <em>Einselection</em>. Finally, I decided to wipe the canvas and simply enter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%5CPsi+%3D+E%5CPsi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{H\Psi = E\Psi}" class="latex" title="{H\Psi = E\Psi}" /> as the minimalist form of Schrödinger’s equation. I’ll leave you to see what the system comes up with on your own fresh canvas.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Search and Research </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The goal is to augment search that includes equations as well as text. For instance, right now I’d like to find sources that use a formula like </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Br%3D0%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D%5Cfrac%7Br%5E2%7D%7Be%5E%7Bar%7D%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{r=0}^{\infty}\frac{r^2}{e^{ar}} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \sum_{r=0}^{\infty}\frac{r^2}{e^{ar}} " /></p>
<p>in the context of statistical tests for distinguishing between distributions. I’ve had success with Google on smaller pieces of TeX but this chunk yields nothing sensible. Changing the variable “<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" />” to “<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" />” changes some of the results but comes no closer; nor does changing to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{i}" class="latex" title="{i}" /> or editing the sum to begin with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" /> not <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0}" class="latex" title="{0}" />. The search should somehow recognize that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a}" class="latex" title="{a}" /> is a constant but is also the main parameter.</p>
<p>
The fact that I’ve typed a particular LaTeX form might be an impediment. I could have written <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%5E2+e%5E%7B-ar%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r^2 e^{-ar}}" class="latex" title="{r^2 e^{-ar}}" /> in the body of the sum without using a fraction. The <em>MathDeck</em> documentation focuses on enabling mathematical search for non-LaTeX users, but independence from syntax for all users is a commensurate goal. The idea is to make formulas “chunks” in their own right, chunks governed by semantics more than syntax, and promote saving and recombining them. For instance, I could save the body and replace the sum by an integral. </p>
<p>
The visual unit for this in <em>MathDeck</em> is the blue oval enclosing a formula. They can be created and edited at the top, imported to make a new <em>card</em>, and combined onto the canvas to build up larger formulas. The paper calls them “chips” but for me they evoke hieroglyphic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartouche">cartouches</a> enclosing royal names. Cards can be marked as favorites and the collection added to. </p>
<p>
Here is an example where I made a cartouche and card out of the abstract form of the main equation in my chess model, as I expounded in a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/10/18/london-calling/">post</a> to mark the 2018 world chess championship match in London.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/07/18/mathematical-search/chessequation/" rel="attachment wp-att-17324"><img width="600" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/chessequation.jpg?w=600&amp;h=368" class="aligncenter wp-image-17324" height="368" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
Once again the system pitches in with interesting associations. Some were expected but others are surprises. Logit and logarithmic loss are naturally associated but I had not heard of “Perplexity,” and what is Benford’s Law doing here? (Dick and I have been trying to find natural <em>exceptions</em> to Benford’s Law in Covid-19 statistics—we’ve not had time yet to tell whether we’ll succeed.)</p>
<p>
The searches at top are still “vanilla” Google search, and the search below the canvas is only within a deck or decks. We look forward to when a truly smart integration of mathematics into major search engines will be engendered by this project.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
How do you see <em>MathDeck</em> and the larger <em>MathSeer</em> project growing in the near future? We hope <em>MathDeck</em> stokes some immediate enjoyment and curiosity.</p>

In this post, we highlight an amazing result: Shamir’s secret sharing scheme. This is one of the most powerful uses of polynomials over a finite field in distributed computing. Intuitively, this scheme allows a $Dealer$ to commit to a secret $s$ by splitting it into shares distributed to $n$ parties....</div>

<p><strong>Call for Papers:</strong> Registration deadline August 12, 2020</p>



<p>3rd SIAM <a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/sosa21">Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms </a> (SOSA)<br />January 11-12, 2021<br />Alexandria, Virginia, U.S.<br />(Held jointly with SODA 2021)<br /><br />Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms (SOSA) is a conference in theoretical computer science dedicated to advancing algorithms research by promoting simplicity and elegance in the design and analysis of algorithms. The benefits of simplicity are manifold: simpler algorithms manifest a better understanding of the problem at hand; they are more likely to be implemented and trusted by practitioners; they can serve as benchmarks, as an initialization step, or as the basis for a “state of the art” algorithm;  they are more easily taught and are more likely to be included in algorithms textbooks; and they attract a broader set of researchers to difficult algorithmic problems.<br /><br />Papers in all areas of algorithms research are sought.  An ideal submission will advance our understanding of an algorithmic problem by, for example, introducing a simpler algorithm, presenting a simpler analysis of an existing algorithm, or offering insights that generally simplify our understanding of important algorithms or computational problems.<br /><br />We are especially interested in papers that make material more accessible to a wider audience, such as undergraduates, or for more specialized topics, general algorithms researchers.<br /><br />Submissions should contain novel ideas or attractive insights, but they are not expected to prove novel theorems. That is, the results themselves can be known, but their presentation must be new.

The body of the paper should be written for a general theoretical computer science audience, and substantiate the main claims of the paper with full proofs. The submission should be typeset using 11 point font, in a single-column format with ample spacing throughout and ample margins all around.  The submissions ought to be visually easy to read.<br />Brevity is a hallmark of simplicity. Authors are specifically encouraged to submit short and simple papers. Final papers may not exceed fifteen (15) pages in double column format.<br /><br />The program committee may designate one or more papers as SOSA Best Papers. All submissions will be considered.</p></div>

Broadly speaking, vary among a few main axes, such as the type of guarantee they provide, the specific similarity between data they consider, and the trust model they aim to address. This last point will be the focus of this post: <em>which notion of privacy is best suited to the specific scenario at hand?</em></p>

<p>We will cover 4 of these notions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>(central) differential privacy (DP)</li>
  <li>local differential privacy (LDP)</li>
  <li>pan-privacy</li>
  <li>shuffle privacy</li>
</ul>

<p>Typically, the world can be divided in a few categories: (i) the users, who hold the data; (ii) the “server,” who runs the algorithm; and (iii) the rest of the world, which does what the rest of the world does. As the name indicates, the <em>trust model</em> boils down to the following simple question: as a user, <strong>who do you trust</strong> with your sensitive data?</p>

<p>In the <em>DP model</em> <strong>[DMNS06]</strong>, the answer is essentially “the server, and nobody else.” Users are happy to provide their data to the server, which runs the algorithm on the resulting dataset; however, the <em>output</em> of that algorithm, which is released to the (untrusted) world, needs to be private, and not reveal sensitive information about any single user.</p>

<p>In the <em>LDP model</em> <strong>[EGS03,KLNRS08]</strong>, the server itself is untrusted, and the answer is “nobody.” Any data communicated by the users must already be private, and even a prying server cannot learn much about any single user. Of course, this is a strictly more stringent privacy model than the central DP one, and this comes at a price: the utility one can obtain from the same amount of data is typically smaller than in the DP model.</p>

<p>The <em>pan-privacy model</em> <strong>[DNPRY10]</strong> introduces the notion of time. Each user contributes their data to the server sequentially, one after the other; once the server is done receiving and processing this data, the output is revealed to the world. The answer to the question then is that users trust the server <em>at the time they send it their data</em>, but maybe not in the future (and they <em>definitely</em> don’t trust the outside world). Put differently, this captures settings where a server can be compromised: at the time a  user sends their data, they trust the server; if the server is compromised at any point in the future, then the data already in the server <em>stays</em> private (but, of course, sending any more data after the server has already been attacked is a bad idea).</p>

<p>Finally, the recent <em>shuffle model</em> of privacy <strong>[CSUZZ19,EFMRTT19]</strong> is in some sense intermediate between the central and local models of DP: users do not trust the server (and, god forbid, they still don’t trust the outside world!); however, they do trust some small blackbox in the middle, whose role is to randomly, well, <em>shuffle</em> the data. That is, when all users send their data to the untrusted server, this box-in-the-middle randomly permutes all the data points, so that the server had no idea who sent which part of the data. This simple-yet-helpful trusted backbox, in turn, can be implemented using e.g., cryptographic primitives; and the goal is to try and provide stronger privacy than in the DP model, while suffering a smaller utility loss than in the stringent LDP model.</p>

<p>It is important to note that <em>there is no right or wrong model</em> of privacy here, and one cannot say that any of the above notion is “better” than the others with regard to both privacy and accuracy. They all aim at modeling different scenarios, and provide incomparable guarantees: depending on your situation, pick the one that fits best.</p>

<p>Hello, welcome to this new website! Our goal is to serve as a hub for the differential privacy research community and to promote the work in this area. Please read on to learn more!</p>

<p>We anticipate posting a variety of content, from announcements to mini-surveys of topics in the differential privacy literature. These are archived on our <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/categories/">Posts</a> page. 
We have also assembled a collection of <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/resources/">Resources</a>, which we hope will help newcomers learn and enter the field.</p>

<p>We have created a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/differential-privacy-org">mailing list</a> for the differential privacy community. 
The goal is to create a channel which could reach the entire differential privacy community at once.
We envision this list being used only to send out announcements of the most broad interest, and as such, it is anticipated to be very low-traffic (≈ 1 post per month).

<h3><a class="entryheader" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/07/16/comparing-multi-sport.html">Comparing multi-sport athletes using bounding-box area</a></h3>
<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Where you have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_center">triangle center</a> defined by the intersection point of three lines or curves, you often also have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">Voronoi diagram</a> or minimization diagram whose cells have those lines as boundaries. For the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumscribed_circle">circumcenter</a>, equidistant from the three vertices of a triangle, the diagram is the classical Voronoi diagram of those three points. For the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incenter">incenter</a>, equidistant from the three sides, the diagram is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_axis">medial axis</a> of the triangle. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_point">Fermat point</a> (when it doesn’t degenerate to a vertex) comes from a diagram that tells you which of the three sides of the triangle spans the widest field of view.</p>

<p>So when I posted recently about <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/04/28/cartesian-triangle-centers.html">Cartesian triangle centers</a> defined by an equality of areas of three bounding boxes, I had in mind a minimization diagram for bounding box area, or actually the signed area  of the bounding box of the moving point  and a fixed site . Here’s one of these diagrams for six points:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/bounding-box-diagram.svg" alt="Minimization diagram for signed bounding box area" /></p>

<p>If you subtract  from the signed areas, you don’t change the minimization diagram (because you’re subtracting the same thing from all the signed areas) but it makes the functions you’re minimizing become linear in  and , explaining the polygonal shape and linear boundaries of the cells in the minimization diagram. As the previous post already described, the bisector between any two cells is the diagonal line of the bounding box of two sites.</p>

<p>I use these diagrams in a paper to appear in the Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry, now online as a preprint: “Dynamic products of ranks” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08123">arXiv:2007.08123</a>). The goal of the paper is to combine two different and unrelated numerical scores of the same items such as the skiing speed and shooting accuracy of a group of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biathlon">biathletes</a>. Biathlons do this by using an arbitrary conversion factor to penalize skiing time based on shooting misses (essentially, adding the converted scores from the two parts of the sport) but instead some other sports multiply the ranks of the athletes within each discipline. So if you got, say, fifth in shooting but second in skiing, your overall score would be ten. My paper studies how quickly you can find the new winner after changing the score of a single competitor or by adding or removing a competitor in a sport using this system.</p>

<p>We can represent a set of items or group of athletes as points in the plane, whose coordinates are their ranks (not their raw scores). Then an update to the data that lies outside both the horizontal and vertical range of these points doesn’t change their relative positions: it might change their ranks, but all in the same way. So for these updates, the signed bounding box area minimization diagram stays unchanged. Because the bounding box area is just the product of ranks, we can use this diagram to quickly look up the winner among these shifted points. The overall strategy of the data structure in my paper is to divide the input data into smaller subsets and maintain their diagrams in such a way that most diagrams stay unchanged, and only a few need rebuilding, after each update. Dividing into more subsets reduces the rebuilding time, because fewer input items will belong to rebuilt diagrams, but increases the query time, because you have to query more diagrams. The  update time for the data structure in the paper comes from choosing the optimal tradeoff between these two terms of the total time.</p>

<p>There are other applications for this sort of rank aggregation beyond athletics; see the paper for details.</p>

<p>Because CCCG is online this year, I also have a video talk prepared, but it’s not yet online; I’ll post a link later. In the meantime, <a href="http://vga.usask.ca/cccg2020/">registration for CCCG is free this year, with a deadline of July 25</a>, and enables both early access to the videos and access to the Q&amp;A sessions with each speaker at the conference itself.</p>

An $(n,r,s)$-design, or $(n,r,s)$-partial Steiner system, is an $r$-uniform hypergraph over $n$ vertices with pairwise hyperedge intersections of size $0$, we extract from $(N,K,n,k)$-adversarial sources of locality $0$, where $K\geq N^\delta$ and $k\geq\text{polylog }n$. The previous best result (Chattopadhyay et al., STOC 2020) required $K\geq N^{1/2+o(1)}$. As a result, we get extractors for small-space sources over $n$ bits with entropy requirement $k\geq n^{1/2+\delta}$, whereas the previous best result (Chattopadhyay et al., STOC 2020) required $k\geq n^{2/3+\delta}$.</div>
