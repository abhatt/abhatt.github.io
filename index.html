logic that strictly contains the logics (connected) MMSNP of Feder and Vardi
and guarded monotone SNP of Bienvenu, ten Cate, Lutz, and Wolter; it is a
promising candidate for an expressive subclass of NP that exhibits a complexity
dichotomy. We show that AMSNP has a complexity dichotomy if and only if
Constraint Satisfaction Problems for reducts of finitely bounded homogeneous
structures have a complexity dichotomy. For such CSPs, powerful
universal-algebraic hardness conditions are known that are conjectured to
describe the border between NP-hard and polynomial-time tractable CSPs. The
connection to CSPs also implies that every AMSNP sentence can be evaluated in
polynomial time on classes of finite structures of bounded treewidth. We show
that the syntax of AMSNP is decidable. The proof relies on the following fact,
which we believe is of independent interest in model theory: for classes of
finite structures given by finitely many forbidden substructures, the
amalgamation property is decidable.

parametrized by {measures that are restrictions of} clique-width, such as
modular-width and neighborhood diversity. The main contribution of this paper
is to introduce a novel parameter, called iterated type partition, that can be
computed in polynomial time and nicely places between modular-width and
neighborhood diversity. We prove that the Equitable Coloring problem is
W[1]-hard when parametrized by the iterated type partition. This result extends
to modular-width, answering an open question about the possibility to have FPT
algorithms for Equitable Coloring when parametrized by modular-width. Moreover,
we show that the Equitable Coloring problem is instead FTP when parameterized
by neighborhood diversity. Furthermore, we present simple and fast FPT
algorithms parameterized by iterated type partition that provide optimal
solutions for several graph problems; in particular, this paper presents
algorithms for the Dominating Set, the Vertex Coloring and the Vertex Cover
problems. While the above problems are already known to be FPT with respect to
modular-width, the novel algorithms are both simpler and more efficient: For
the Dominating set and Vertex Cover problems, our algorithms output an optimal
set in time $O(2^t+poly(n))$, while for the Vertex Coloring problem, our

satisfiability algorithms. So far, this program has yielded several concrete
results, proving that functions in $\text{Quasi-NP} = \text{NTIME}[n^{(\log
n)^{O(1)}}]$ and $\text{NEXP}$ do not have small circuits from various circuit
classes ${\cal C}$, by showing that ${\cal C}$ admits non-trivial
satisfiability and/or $\#$SAT algorithms which beat exhaustive search by a
minor amount.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we present a new strong lower bound consequence of non-trivial
$\#$SAT algorithm for a circuit class ${\mathcal C}$. Say a symmetric Boolean
function $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ is sparse if it outputs $1$ on $O(1)$ values of
$\sum_i x_i$. We show that for every sparse $f$, and for all "typical" ${\cal
C}$, faster $\#$SAT algorithms for ${\cal C}$ circuits actually imply lower
bounds against the circuit class $f \circ {\cal C}$, which may be stronger than
${\cal C}$ itself. In particular:
</p>
<p>$\#$SAT algorithms for $n^k$-size ${\cal C}$-circuits running in $2^n/n^k$
time (for all $k$) imply $\text{NEXP}$ does not have $f \circ {\cal
C}$-circuits of polynomial size.
</p>
<p>$\#$SAT algorithms for $2^{n^{\epsilon}}$-size ${\cal C}$-circuits running in
$2^{n-n^{\epsilon}}$ time (for some $\epsilon &gt; 0$) imply $\text{Quasi-NP}$
does not have $f \circ {\cal C}$-circuits of polynomial size.
</p>
<p>Applying $\#$SAT algorithms from the literature, one immediate corollary of
our results is that $\text{Quasi-NP}$ does not have $\text{EMAJ} \circ
\text{ACC}^0 \circ \text{THR}$ circuits of polynomial size, where $\text{EMAJ}$
is the "exact majority" function, improving previous lower bounds against
$\text{ACC}^0$ [Williams JACM'14] and $\text{ACC}^0 \circ \text{THR}$ [Williams
STOC'14], [Murray-Williams STOC'18]. This is the first nontrivial lower bound
against such a circuit class.

dynamically, rather than setting them once and for all. This is true in both
optical wide area networks (optical WANs) and in datacenters, despite the many
differences between these two settings. Because of these new technologies,
there has been a surge of both practical and theoretical research on algorithms
to take advantage of them. In particular, Jia et al. [INFOCOM '17] designed
online scheduling algorithms for dynamically reconfigurable topologies for both
the makespan and sum of completion times objectives. In this paper, we work in
the same setting but study an objective that is more meaningful in an online
setting: the sum of flow times. The flow time of a job is the total amount of
time that it spends in the system, which may be considerably smaller than its
completion time if it is released late. We provide competitive algorithms for
the online setting with speed augmentation, and also give a lower bound proving
that speed augmentation is in fact necessary. As a side effect of our
techniques, we also improve and generalize the results of Jia et al. on
completion times by giving an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm for arbitrary sizes
and release times even when nodes have different degree bounds, and moreover
allow for the weighted sum of completion times (or flow times).

completion of an arbitrary graph into a cograph. The first one is able to do so
while providing an additional property which is crucial in practice to obtain
inclusion-minimal completions using as few edges as possible : it is able to
compute a minimum-cardinality completion of the neighbourhood of the new vertex
introduced at each incremental step. It runs in $O(n+m')$ time, where $m'$ is
the number of edges in the completed graph. This matches the complexity of the
algorithm in [Lokshtanov, Mancini and Papadopoulos 2010] and positively answers
one of their open questions. Our second algorithm improves the complexity of
inclusion-minimal completion to $O(n+m\log^2 n)$ when the additional property
above is not required. Moreover, we prove that many very sparse graphs, having
only $O(n)$ edges, require $\Omega(n^2)$ edges in any of their cograph
completions. For these graphs, which include many of those encountered in
applications, the improvement we obtain on the complexity scales as $O(n/\log^2
n)$.

heuristics, where the number of nodes per route is balanced. The first
heuristic uses a nearest node approach and the second assigns the closest
vehicle (salesman). A comparison of heuristics with test-instances being in the
Euclidean plane showed similar solution quality and runtime. On average, the
nearest node solutions are approximately one percent better. The closest
vehicle heuristic is especially important when the nodes (customers) are not
known in advance, e.g. for online routing. Whilst the nearest node is
preferable when one vehicle has to be used multiple times to service all
customers. The second contribution is a closed form formula that describes the
mTSP distance dependent on the number of vehicles and customers. Increasing the
number of salesman results in an approximately linear distance growth for
uniformly distributed nodes in a Euclidean grid plane. The distance growth is
almost proportional to the square root of number of customers (nodes). These
two insights are combined in a single formula. The minimum distance of a node
to $n$ uniformly distributed random (real and integer) points was derived and
expressed as functional relationship dependent on the number of vehicles. This
gives theoretical underpinnings and is in agreement with the distances found
via the previous mTSP heuristics. Hence, this allows to compute all expected
mTSP distances without the need of running the heuristics.

<p>Given a {\em weighted} undirected graph $G = (V,E,\omega)$, and a pair of
parameters $\epsilon &gt; 0$, $\beta = 1,2,\ldots$, a graph $G'= (V,H,\omega')$ is
a {\em $(1+\epsilon,\beta)$-hopset} (aka, a {\em near-exact hopset}) of $G$ if
for every $u,v \in V$, $$d_G(u,v) \le d_{G\cup G'}^{(\beta)}(u,v) \le
(1+\epsilon)d_G(u,v)~,$$ where $ d_{G\cup G'}^{(\beta)}(u,v)$ stands for a
$\beta$-(hop)-bounded distance between $u$ and $v$ in the union graph $G \cup
G'$. It was shown in \cite{EN16} that for any $n$-vertex $G$ and $\epsilon$ and
$\kappa$ as above, there exists a $(1+\epsilon,\beta)$-hopset with
$\tilde{O}(n^{1+1/\kappa})$ edges, with $\beta = \beta_{EP}$.
</p>
<p>Not only the two results of \cite{EP01} and \cite{EN16} are strikingly
similar, but so are also their proof techniques. Moreover, Thorup-Zwick's later
construction of near-additive spanners \cite{TZ06} was also shown in
\cite{EN19,HP17} to provide hopsets with analogous (to that of \cite{TZ06})
properties.
</p>
<p>In this survey we explore this intriguing phenomenon, sketch the basic proof
techniques used for these results, and highlight open questions.

algorithms. Earlier methods in the literature suggest a trend toward non-myopic
algorithms using queueing principles. We propose a new model formulation based
on a static node-charge graph structure into a p-median relocation problem with
minimum cost flow conservation and path-based charging station capacities. The
model is NP-complete, so a heuristic is proposed that ensures feasible
intermediate solutions that can be solved for an online system. Assessment of
the algorithm in computational tests suggest optimality gaps of 8-20% among the
tested instances of up to 1000 nodes while achieving 20x computational time
savings needed for online application. The algorithm is validated in a case
study of electric carshare in Brooklyn, New York, with demand data shared from
BMW ReachNow operations in September 2017 (262 vehicle fleet, 231 pickups per
day, 303 TAZs) and charging station location data (18 charging stations with 4
port capacities). Compared to the existing non-EV, no rebalancing data from BMW
ReachNow, operating an EV fleet will obviously increase cost. Our proposed
non-myopic rebalancing heuristic would reduce the cost increase compared to
myopic rebalancing by 42%. Other managerial insights are further discussed.

well studied research problem in the literature. In online scheduling, the
scheduler receives a list of jobs one by one and assigns each incoming job on
the fly irrevocably to one of the machines before the arrival of the next job.
In this paper, we study a variant of the online scheduling problem, where jobs
are requested on the fly from k distinct sources. On simultaneous arrival of
jobs from multiple sources, it is a non-trivial research challenge to ensure
fairness in scheduling with respect to distinct sources, while optimizing the
overall makespan of the schedule. We develop a novel Multi Lists Scheduling
Model(MLS) and propose a 2-competitive deterministic online algorithm namely
Largest Job on Least Loaded Machine(LJLLM) based on the MLS model to address
the above mentioned research challenge.

matrices with bindings to a variety of languages (Python, Julia, and
Matlab/Octave). GraphBLAS provides a lightweight in-memory database
implementation of hypersparse matrices that are ideal for analyzing many types
of network data, while providing rigorous mathematical guarantees, such as
linearity. Streaming updates of hypersparse matrices put enormous pressure on
the memory hierarchy. This work benchmarks an implementation of hierarchical
hypersparse matrices that reduces memory pressure and dramatically increases
the update rate into a hypersparse matrices. The parameters of hierarchical
hypersparse matrices rely on controlling the number of entries in each level in
the hierarchy before an update is cascaded. The parameters are easily tunable
to achieve optimal performance for a variety of applications. Hierarchical
hypersparse matrices achieve over 1,000,000 updates per second in a single
instance. Scaling to 31,000 instances of hierarchical hypersparse matrices
arrays on 1,100 server nodes on the MIT SuperCloud achieved a sustained update
rate of 75,000,000,000 updates per second. This capability allows the MIT
SuperCloud to analyze extremely large streaming network data sets.

based on a set of anchoring local alignments as input. Depending on the
optimization criteria and the exact definition of a chain, there are several
$O(n \log n)$ time algorithms to solve this problem optimally, where $n$ is the
number of input anchors.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we focus on a formulation allowing the anchors to overlap in a
chain. This formulation was studied by Shibuya and Kurochin (WABI 2003), but
their algorithm comes with no proof of correctness. We revisit and modify their
algorithm to consider a strict definition of precedence relation on anchors,
adding the required derivation to convince on the correctness of the resulting
algorithm that runs in $O(n \log^2 n)$ time on anchors formed by exact matches.
With the more relaxed definition of precedence relation considered by Shibuya
and Kurochin or when anchors are non-nested such as matches of uniform length
($k$-mers), the algorithm takes $O(n \log n)$ time.
</p>
<p>We also establish a connection between chaining with overlaps to the widely
studied longest common subsequence (LCS) problem.

Given a sequence of job arrivals and departures, the goal is to maintain an
approximately fair allocation of the resource against a target fair allocation
policy, while minimizing the total number of disruptions, which is the number
of times the allocation of any job is changed. We consider a rich class of fair
allocation policies that significantly generalize those considered in previous
work.
</p>
<p>We first consider the models where jobs only arrive, or jobs only depart. We
present tight upper and lower bounds for the number of disruptions required to
maintain a constant approximate fair allocation every time step. In particular,
for the canonical case where jobs have weights and the resource allocation is
proportional to the job's weight, we show that maintaining a constant
approximate fair allocation requires $\Theta(\log^* n)$ disruptions per job,
almost matching the bounds in prior work for the unit weight case. For the more
general setting where the allocation policy only decreases the allocation to a
job when new jobs arrive, we show that maintaining a constant approximate fair
allocation requires $\Theta(\log n)$ disruptions per job. We then consider the
model where jobs can both arrive and depart. We first show strong lower bounds
on the number of disruptions required to maintain constant approximate fairness
for arbitrary instances. In contrast we then show that there there is an
algorithm that can maintain constant approximate fairness with $O(1)$ expected
disruptions per job if the weights of the jobs are independent of the jobs
arrival and departure order. We finally show how our results can be extended to
the setting with multiple resources.

<p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/j/Jain:Shweta.html">Shweta Jain</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Seshadhri:C=.html">C. Seshadhri</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.06784">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>Clique counting is a fundamental task in network analysis, and even the
simplest setting of $3$-cliques (triangles) has been the center of much recent
research. Getting the count of $k$-cliques for larger $k$ is algorithmically
challenging, due to the exponential blowup in the search space of large
cliques. But a number of recent applications (especially for community
detection or clustering) use larger clique counts. Moreover, one often desires
\textit{local} counts, the number of $k$-cliques per vertex/edge.
</p>
<p>Our main result is Pivoter, an algorithm that exactly counts the number of
$k$-cliques, \textit{for all values of $k$}. It is surprisingly effective in
practice, and is able to get clique counts of graphs that were beyond the reach
of previous work. For example, Pivoter gets all clique counts in a social
network with a 100M edges within two hours on a commodity machine. Previous
parallel algorithms do not terminate in days. Pivoter can also feasibly get
local per-vertex and per-edge $k$-clique counts (for all $k$) for many public
data sets with tens of millions of edges. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first algorithm that achieves such results.
</p>
<p>The main insight is the construction of a Succinct Clique Tree (SCT) that
stores a compressed unique representation of all cliques in an input graph. It
is built using a technique called \textit{pivoting}, a classic approach by
Bron-Kerbosch to reduce the recursion tree of backtracking algorithms for
maximal cliques. Remarkably, the SCT can be built without actually enumerating
all cliques, and provides a succinct data structure from which exact clique
statistics ($k$-clique counts, local counts) can be read off efficiently.

genes sampled from several species, enabling useful predictions about phenomena
such as the discordance between the gene tree and the species phylogeny due to
incomplete lineage sorting. Conversely, knowledge of large collections of gene
trees can inform us about several aspects of the species phylogeny, such as its
topology and ancestral population sizes. A fundamental open problem in this
context is how to efficiently compute the probability of a gene tree topology,
given the species phylogeny. Although a number of algorithms for this task have
been proposed, they either produce approximate results, or, when they are
exact, they do not scale to large data sets. In this paper, we present some
progress towards exact and efficient computation of the probability of a gene
tree topology. We provide a new algorithm that, given a species tree and the
number of genes sampled for each species, calculates the probability that the
gene tree topology will be concordant with the species tree. Moreover, we
provide an algorithm that computes the probability of any specific gene tree
topology concordant with the species tree. Both algorithms run in polynomial
time and have been implemented in Python. Experiments show that they are able
to analyse data sets where thousands of genes are sampled, in a matter of
minutes to hours.

enough sequence is hit by the set (i.e., it contains a word from the set).
There is a tight relationship between universal hitting sets and minimizers
schemes, where minimizers schemes with low density (i.e., efficient schemes)
correspond to universal hitting sets of small size. Local schemes are a
generalization of minimizers schemes which can be used as replacement for
minimizers scheme with the possibility of being much more efficient. We
establish the link between efficient local schemes and the minimum length of a
string that must be hit by a universal hitting set. We give bounds for the
remaining path length of the Mykkeltveit universal hitting set. Additionally,
we create a local scheme with the lowest known density that is only a log
factor away from the theoretical lower bound.

<p>Title: The lower tail for triangles in random graphs</p>
<p>Abstract:<br />
Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="X" class="latex" title="X" /> denote the number of triangles in the random graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_%7Bn%2Cp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="G_{n,p}" class="latex" title="G_{n,p}" />. The problem of determining the asymptotics of the logarithmic lower tail probability of~<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="X" class="latex" title="X" />, that is, the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_c%28n%2Cp%29+%3D+-+%5Clog+Pr%28X+%5Cle+c+%5Cmathbb+E+%5BX%5D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f_c(n,p) = - \log Pr(X \le c \mathbb E [X])" class="latex" title="f_c(n,p) = - \log Pr(X \le c \mathbb E [X])" />, for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%5Cin+%5B0%2C1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="c \in [0,1)" class="latex" title="c \in [0,1)" />, has attracted considerable attention of both the combinatorics and the probability communities. In this talk, we explain how one can bound <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_c%28n%2Cp%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f_c(n,p)" class="latex" title="f_c(n,p)" /> from above by solving a natural combinatorial optimisation problem that generalises Mantel’s / Turán’s theorem. Moreover, we will prove a matching lower bound on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_c%28n%2Cp%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f_c(n,p)" class="latex" title="f_c(n,p)" /> in the case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3D+1%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="p = 1/2" class="latex" title="p = 1/2" />. Our argument, which employs ideas from an earlier joint work with Gady Kozma, Tom Meyerovitch, and Ron Peled, exploits connections between entropy and independence.</p>
<p>This is joint work with Gady Kozma.</p></div>

validate the reasoning ability of AI agents. The pivot to existing VQA models
is the joint embedding that is learned by combining the visual features from an
image and the semantic features from a given question. Consequently, a large
body of literature has focused on developing complex joint embedding strategies
coupled with visual attention mechanisms to effectively capture the interplay
between these two modalities. However, modelling the visual and semantic
features in a high dimensional (joint embedding) space is computationally
expensive, and more complex models often result in trivial improvements in the
VQA accuracy. In this work, we systematically study the trade-off between the
model complexity and the performance on the VQA task. VQA models have a diverse
architecture comprising of pre-processing, feature extraction, multimodal
fusion, attention and final classification stages. We specifically focus on the
effect of "multi-modal fusion" in VQA models that is typically the most
expensive step in a VQA pipeline. Our thorough experimental evaluation leads us
to two proposals, one optimized for minimal complexity and the other one
optimized for state-of-the-art VQA performance.

<p>Gerard Ben Arous, Surya Ganguli, Florent Krzakala and Lenka Zdeborova are organizing a <a href="http://leshouches2020.krzakala.org/">summer school on statistical physics of machine learning </a>on August 2-28, 2020 in Les Houches, France. If you don’t know Les Houches, it apparently  looks like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/chalet.jpg?w=414" alt="" class="wp-image-7641" /></figure>



<p>They are looking for applications from students, postdocs, and young researchers in physics &amp; math, as well computer scientists. While I am biased (I will be lecturing there too) I think the combination of lecturers, speakers, and audience members will yield a very unique opportunity for interaction across communities, and strongly encourage theoretical computer scientists to apply (which you can from the <a href="http://leshouches2020.krzakala.org/">website</a>). Let me also use this opportunity to remind people again of <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2019/03/30/physics-computation-blog-post-round-up/">Tselil Schramm’s blog post</a> where she collected some of the lecture notes from the seminar we ran on physics &amp; computation.</p>



<p><strong>More information about the summer school:</strong></p>



<p>The “Les Houches school of physics”, situated close to Chamonix and the Mont Blanc in the French Alps, has a long history of forming generations of young researchers on the frontiers of their fields. Our school is aimed primarily at the growing audience of theoretical physicists and applied mathematicians interested in machine learning and high-dimensional data analysis, as well as to <strong>colleagues from other fields</strong> interested in this interface. <em>[my emphasis –Boaz]</em> We will cover basics and frontiers of high-dimensional statistics, machine learning, the theory of computing and learning, and probability theory. We will focus in particular on methods of statistical physics and their results in the context of current questions and theories related to machine learning and neural networks. The school will also cover examples of applications of machine learning methods in physics research, as well as other emerging applications of wide interest. Open questions and directions will be presented as well.</p>



<p>Students, postdocs and young researchers interested to participate in the event are invited to apply on the website <a href="http://leshouches2020.krzakala.org/" rel="nofollow">http://leshouches2020.krzakala.org/</a> before March 15, 2020. The capacity of the school is limited, and due to this constraint participants will be selected from the applicants and participants will be required to attend the whole event.</p>

<p>
Claire Cameron is the senior science editor at an online publication called <a href="https://www.inverse.com/"><i>Inverse</i></a>. She has written an incomplete <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/61364-2020-science-and-tech-predictions">article</a> titled, “The 2020s: 20 science and tech predictions for the new decade.” She has posted 12 of the predictions, but the top 8 will be revealed on Wednesday, January 22.  <b>Update 1/22</b>: The predictions will be revealed over the coming week.</p>
<p>
Today we offer a game of predicting: what will she predict? We also make some predictions for this year, including some that have already come true—the best kind.</p>
<p>
Here are her 12 predictions. See if you can guess her other 8:</p>
<ul>
<li>
20. In the 2020s, human-level A.I. will arrive and finally pass the Turing test. <p></p>
</li><li>
19. In the 2020s, tiny biosensors could make a 911 phone call from Mars. <p></p>
</li><li>
18. Hyperloop, Elon Musk’s vacuum-sealed transit system, may get a speed boost. <p></p>
</li><li>
17. In the 2020s, we will have a real Robot Olympics. (And it’ll be a lot cooler than the regular Olympics.) <p></p>
</li><li>
16. A woeful prediction: Air pollution levels will remain constant in the ’20s. <p></p>
</li><li>
15. Solar panels will continue to decline in price in the 2020s. <p></p>
</li><li>
14. Humans return to the Moon. <p></p>
</li><li>
13. Killer robots may roam the Earth. (That is, autonomous weapons will become reality.) <p></p>
</li><li>
12. We’re gonna live a whole lot longer. (The linked description muses about 1,000-year lifespans beginning this decade.) <p></p>
</li><li>
11. If you hope to see a self-driving car this decade, keep dreaming. <p></p>
</li><li>
10. We’ll witness CRISPR gene-editing trials on humans. <p></p>
</li><li>
9. We’ll be doing experiments on lab-grown brains.
</li></ul>
<p>
There are already some clear big ones: yes to the Turing test and long lifespans and gene+brain editing but nix to self-driving cars. There may be some logical entailments, e.g., if 11 is false—so that self-driving cars are released—does that make 13 true? </p>
<p>
None of these predictions is out-of-the-blue: they all connect to initiatives already underway. So there should be some basis for inferring the missing eight. Quantum computing is one obvious area. Reviewing last year’s predictions will bring us there.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Last Year’s Predictions </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We made 5 perennial predictions and 5 new ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>No circuit lower bound of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1000n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1000n}" class="latex" title="{1000n}" /> or better will be proved for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathrm%7BSAT%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathrm{SAT}}" class="latex" title="{\mathrm{SAT}}" />.</em> Check. <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>A “provably” secure crypto-system will be broken.</em> No need to check—happens all the time. <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>At least five claims that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D+%3D+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}}" /> and five that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D+%5Cneq+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}" /> will be made.</em> The <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P}}" /> versus <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" /> claims <a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/~gwoegi/P-versus-NP.htm">page</a> has stopped being updated, but we can just count from comments on this blog. <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>A computer scientist will win a Nobel Prize.</em> Again, not close—unless you count how vital lithium-ion batteries are to laptop computers. Two physicists won for discovering exoplanets in Earth-Sun type contexts, a question we retired last year. <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>A Clay problem will be solved, or at least notable progress made.</em> A year ago we said this did not happen in 2018, but now for 2019 we’ll say <em>yes</em> based on a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07321.pdf">paper</a> by Michael Griffin, Ken Ono, Larry Rolen, and Don Zagier (GORZ), which we covered <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/29/a-prime-breakthrough/">here</a> with progress on the Riemann Hypothesis.
</li></ul>
<p>
The GORZ paper was #1 on this <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/g30346822/biggest-math-breakthroughs-2019/">list</a> of “The 10 Biggest Math Breakthroughs of 2019” by <em>Popular Mechanics</em>. We also covered the list’s <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/09/30/writing-33-as-a-sum-of-cubes/">#2</a>, <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/09/26/quantum-switch-em/">#3</a> (in one subsection), <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/07/12/tools-and-sensitivity/">#4</a> (with a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/07/25/discrepancy-games-and-sensitivity/">followup</a>), and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/03/21/the-shortest-path-to-the-abel-prize/">#10</a> items—not too bad. </p>
<p>
The five non-perennial predictions from last year were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Deep learning methods will be found able to solve integer factoring. This will place current cryptography is trouble.</em> We had guessed a followup to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03768.pdf">this</a> or <a href="https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/factoring-massive-numbers-a-new-machine-learning-approach">this</a>, but we do not see one from 2019. <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>Deep learning methods will be found to help prove that factoring is hard.</em> See above. Instead, there was <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2019/Q3/poor-mans-qubit-can-solve-quantum-problems-without-going-quantum.html">this</a> (or see <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4342">this</a>). <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>The lines between heuristically solvable and really hard problems will become clearer—or more simply, SAT-solvers will hit a wall.</em> Well hey, the best papers in the <a href="http://sat2019.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/program.html">program</a> for the SAT 2019 conference in Lisbon included <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rrw/On_Super_Strong_ETH.pdf">this</a> by Nikhil Vyas and Ryan Williams. It refutes a “super-strong ETH” statement for random <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k}" class="latex" title="{k}" />-SAT instances with a fixed clause-to-variable ratio. So we guess a wall got broken thru instead. <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>An algorithm originating in a theoretical model will be enshrined in law.</em> The Supreme Court cases on gerrymandering which we thought could do this instead nixed the algorithmic model—for now. Differential privacy was formally <a href="https://www2.census.gov/about/policies/2019-11-paper-differential-privacy.pdf">adopted</a> for the 2020 Census, but apparently at the level of memoranda pursuant to the long-existing Title 13 rather than to new legislation. <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>Quantum supremacy will be proved—finally.</em>  This needs its own subsection to evaluate.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p></p><h3> Quantum Supremacy </h3><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Last year, if we had written “claimed” or even “achieved,” we would now say <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/10/27/quantum-supremacy-at-last/">bingo</a>. But writing “proved” sets a higher standard. To judge from <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4447">this</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/hardware/ibm-edges-closer-to-quantum-supremacy-with-50qubit-processor">this</a>, it appears the Google-led team is upping their qubit count from 53 to 57 in order to shore up their quantum supremacy claim. </p>
<p>
However, we look back at what we called the “three planks” of a quantum supremacy claim:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Build a physical device capable of a nontrivial sampling task. <p></p>
</li><li>
Prove that it gains advantage over known classical approaches. <p></p>
</li><li>
Prove that comparable classical hardware cannot gain such advantage.
</li></ol>
<p>
We don’t think IBM’s 2.5-day simulation that would run on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(supercomputer)">Summit</a> supercomputer is “comparable hardware” enough to count as a “known classical approach.” So we claim part credit even with the “proved” wording based on plank 2 surviving IBM’s challenge and any other as far as we know. There is still our friend Gil Kalai’s now-detailed <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/12/27/the-google-quantum-supremacy-demo/">critique</a> of the modeling that the Google team’s analysis leans on. </p>
<p>
The level of plank 2 is what we meant a year ago anyway. See how we flip things in our last prediction below.  Incidentally, in regard to the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4450">argument</a> over the terms quantum “supremacy” and “advantage,” we stand by the different definitions toward the end of our predictions <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/01/06/predictions-for-2019/">post</a> a year ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Five Predictions for 2020 </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
For our five predictions—besides the five perennial ones—we start with something easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>The power of multiple quantum entangled provers will be resolved, with repercussions for other areas of mathematics.</em>
</li></ul>
<p>
This isn’t a total gimme: the proof could be wrong. The idea and connections, however, already seem clear.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Resolving the Sunflower Conjecture will run up against mainstream complexity theory issues.</em>
</li></ul>
<p>
This may be more a stretch. We note this new <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~anuprao/pubs/sunflower.pdf">paper</a> by Anup Rao simplifying some aspects of the proof of last year’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08483">advance</a> on the problem by Ryan Alweiss, Shachar Lovett, Kewen Wu, and Jiapeng Zhang. Sunflower bounds are known to impact some complexity problems that seem more specialized, but neither paper mentions widening the contingencies. But talking about “mainstream” complexity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>A previously overlooked contingency involving two pairs of complexity classes will be found that can be taught in an intro theory course.</em> We mean something like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P+%3D+P+%5Cimplies+PSPACE+%3D+X%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{\#P = P \implies PSPACE = X}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{\#P = P \implies PSPACE = X}}" />, where of course we don’t know what <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BX%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{X}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{X}}" /> is. <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>The fourth-power upper bound given by Hao Huang’s proof of the Sensitivity Conjecture will be improved to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bbs%28f%29+%3D+o%28s%28f%29%5E4%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{bs(f) = o(s(f)^4)}" class="latex" title="{bs(f) = o(s(f)^4)}" /> but not to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bbs%28f%29+%3D+o%28s%28f%29%5E%7B4-%5Cdelta%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{bs(f) = o(s(f)^{4-\delta})}" class="latex" title="{bs(f) = o(s(f)^{4-\delta})}" /> for any fixed <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta &gt; 0}" class="latex" title="{\delta &gt; 0}" />.</em>
</li></ul>
<p>
We don’t have a concrete reason to think this, only the thought that if this were false in either direction then that might have been found already in the half-year since Huang’s paper. We note this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.05406.pdf">survey</a> from two weeks ago. </p>
<p>
Now to get back to quantum. Instead of refining what we wrote a year ago, we do the opposite:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>The statistical test underlying the quantum supremacy claim will not be tied to a mainstream complexity collapse.</em>
</li></ul>
<p>
That is, the coming year will <em>not</em> see a result of the form: if polynomial-sized classical hardware can achieve the same statistical separation as modeled for the quantum hardware (under either the linear or logarithmic “cross-entropy benchmark”) then counting and hence the polynomial hierarchy collapses to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CSigma_3%5Ep+%5Ccap+%5CPi_3%5Ep%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\Sigma_3^p \cap \Pi_3^p}" class="latex" title="{\Sigma_3^p \cap \Pi_3^p}" />. Thus we expect to still be talking about all this a year from now.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> A Poem </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Talking about talking about quantum supremacy, I wrote a short poem on its larger significances:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> ‘It From Bit’ we once proclaimed,<br />
but now the Bit has bit the dust<br />
from whizzing quantum chips that gamed<br />
coherence to evade the trust<br />
that the Word drove creation’s hour:<br />
Mother Nature fully lexical.<br />
Why don’t our brains then have this power?<br />
It is a status most perplexical. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The import of the <em>polynomial-time Church-Turing thesis</em> is that symbolic computation, our brains, our computing devices whose programs execute at the level of machine <em>language</em>, and natural processes on which any computing device can be based, are equivalent under broad notions of efficiency not just in computability. If this <em>fails</em>, then we can ask a question like the one about illusions quoted at the end of last week’s <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/01/12/our-thoughts-on-pnp/">post</a> on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" />: why would so many smart people have had the illusion that the universe is based on classical information? This may have quick answers: the theory of quantum information wasn’t yet appreciated; it shares many similarities with classical information theory; classical information <a href="https://www.informationphilosopher.com/introduction/physics/quantum_to_classical.html">remains</a> in the <a href="https://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-02-5769">picture</a>.  Note that the Simons <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~phayden/simons/overview.pdf">initiative</a> <i>It From Qubit</i> has existed for some time.</p>
<p>
But then comes a second question. Richard Dawkins <a href="https://www.skeptics.com.au/resources/articles/the-information-challenge/">speaks</a> for many biologists in underscoring that the major open issues in the genesis of life concern the processing of information to build complex structures. If nature affords capability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> to this processing, one would expect complex biological structures—in particular, our brains—to evolve to avail it. Well, Roger Penrose spearheaded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mind">effort</a> to show that our brains employ distinctive quantum processes, but the physical side of his argument has been blunted by evidence. It could be that “quantum advantage” is not a life advantage. The classical falling-short of our grey matter would still be curious.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What are your predictions for 2020? What are your <em>meta</em>-predictions for the coming decade—that is, which 8 predictions do you think Claire Cameron will post on Wednesday? It may help you to know that last month she wrote a science <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/61863-science-explain-cats-movie-creepy">article</a> on the movie <em>Cats</em>.</p>

<div class="content">
We provide a tight characterisation of proof size in resolution for quantified Boolean formulas (QBF) by circuit complexity. Such a characterisation was previously obtained for a hierarchy of QBF Frege systems (Beyersdorff &amp; Pich, LICS 2016), but leaving open the most important case of QBF resolution. Different from the Frege case, our characterisation uses a new version of decision lists as its circuit model, which is stronger than the CNFs the system works with. Our decision list model is well suited to compute countermodels for QBFs.

Our characterisation works for both Q-Resolution and QU-Resolution, which we show to be polynomially equivalent for QBFs of bounded quantifier alternation.

Using our characterisation we obtain a size-width relation for QBF resolution in the spirit of the celebrated result for propositional resolution (Ben-Sasson &amp; Wigderson, J. ACM 2001). However, our result is not just a replication of the propositional relation - intriguingly ruled out  for QBF  in previous research (Beyersdorff et al., ACM ToCL 2018) - but shows a different dependence between size, width, and quantifier complexity.

We demonstrate that our new technique elegantly reproves known QBF hardness results and unifies previous lower-bound techniques in the QBF domain.</div>

<div class="content">
<p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-satisfiability">2-satisfiability problem</a>, or 2SAT, the input is a system of constraints between pairs of Boolean variables, and the problem is to find a truth assignment satisfying all the constraints. Although the usual formulation writes the constraints as disjunctions (Boolean or), it’s convenient and equivalent to use implications instead, where each side of an implication can be either one of the variables or its negation. If you encode the variables as numbers, with  for true and  for false, then the negation of a variable  is  and the implication  can be encoded as the linear inequality . If we forget the restriction that the values are  or , this system of inequalities defines a convex polytope, which can be thought of as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming_relaxation">relaxation</a> of the given 2SAT problem. Each solution to the 2SAT problem corresponds to a vertex of this polytope but there might be other vertices as well, with fractional coordinates. We don’t want those; it’s more useful to have a polytope <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_polytope">all of whose coordinates are integers</a>, coming from solutions to the underlying 2SAT problem. When does this happen (without adding extra inequalities)?</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure the answer has been known, at least implicitly, for a long time, and that there are no new ideas in the rest of this post. See e.g. the answer to <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/a/46188/95">this very closely related question on relaxations of the vertex cover problem</a> and note that vertex cover can be formulated as 2SAT, with a variable per vertex and two constraints per edge of the input graph. But when I looked for it, I found it difficult to find references that give the answer explicitly. So here it is. The following conditions are equivalent:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The given 2SAT instance has an integral relaxation.</li>
  <li>The given 2SAT instance has two solutions that are the complements of each other (each variable is true in one of the solutions and false in the other).</li>
  <li>The compatibility graph of the given 2SAT instance is bipartite.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, the compatibility graph is an undirected graph defined by Feder in “Network Flow and 2-Satisfiability” (<em>Algorithmica</em> 1994). It has a vertex for each literal (a variable or its negation). The two vertices for a variable and its negation are connected by an edge, called a “trivial edge”. Additionally,
for each implication , the two literals  and  cannot both be true, and we add an edge between them.</p>

<p>If the compatibility graph is bipartite, two-color it, make the vertices of one color be true, and make the vertices of the other color be false. Then this gives a solution to the 2SAT instance whose complement is also a solution. So the third condition implies the second condition.</p>

<p>The relaxation of any 2SAT instance contains the point whose coordinates all equal , and if the given instance has an integral relaxation then this point can be represented as a weighted average of integer solutions. An odd cycle in the compatibility graph would prevent that from being possible. For any point in the relaxation, and any literal, we consider the value of the literal to be either its coordinate value (if it represents a variable) or one minus that value (if it represents a negated variable). If some cycle has odd length , then each integer point in the weighted average could only have total value at most  on the literals of the cycle, so their weighted average would also be at most , less than the cycle’s total value of  in the all- solution. So the first condition implies the third condition.</p>

<p>Finally, suppose that there are two complementary solutions, and flip the variables if necessary so that these are the all-false and all-true assignments to the variables. (This flipping simplifies the problem without changing any of the three conditions.) Consider any fractional solution , and construct from it a probability distribution on truth assignments as follows: choose a uniformly random number , set to true the variables whose coordinate value is at least , and set to false the remaining variables.
All truth assignments generated in this way solve the 2SAT problem, because any violation of an implication constraint in the 2SAT problem would translate to a violation of the corresponding coordinate inequality constraint in the relaxation. The given fractional solution  is a weighted average of the resulting collection of 2SAT solutions, where the weight of a solution is the probability of generating it. Therefore, the second condition implies the first condition.</p>

<p><strong>Live Updates for Wednesday January 22:</strong></p>



<p>Alas, I’ve come down with a nasty cold (is there any other kind?).  So I’m paring back my participation in the rest of Davos to the stuff that really interests me.  The good news is that my quantum computing sessions are already finished!</p>



<p>This morning, as I sat in the lobby of the Congress Centre checking my email and blowing my nose, I noticed some guy playing a cello nearby.  Dozens were gathered around him — so many that I could barely see the guy, only hear the music.  After he was finished, I worked up the courage to ask someone what the fuss was about.  Turns out that the guy was Yo-Yo Ma.</p>



<p>The Prince Regent of Liechtenstein was explaining to one of my quantum computing colleagues that Liechtenstein does not have much in the way of quantum.</p>



<p>Speaking of princes, I’m now at a cybersecurity session with Shafi Goldwasser and others, at which the attendance might be slightly depressed because it’s up against Prince Charles.  That’s right: Davos is the conference where the heir apparent to the British throne <em>speaks in a parallel session</em>.</p>



<p>I’ve realized these past few days that I’m not very good at schmoozing with powerful people.  On the other hand, it’s possible that my being bad at it is a sort of mental defense mechanism.  The issue is that, the more I became a powerful “thought leader” who unironically used phrases like “Fourth Industrial Revolution” or “disruptive innovation,” the more I used business cards and LinkedIn to expand my network of contacts or checked my social media metrics … well, the less I’d be able to do the research that led to stuff like being invited here in the first place.  I imagine that many Davos regulars started out as nerds like me, and that today, coming to Davos to talk about “disruptive innovation” is a fun kind of semi-retirement.  If so, though, I’m not ready to retire just yet!  I still want to do things that are new enough that they don’t need to be described using multiple synonyms for newness.</p>



<p>Apparently one of the hottest tickets at Davos is a post-Forum Shabbat dinner, which used to be frequented by Shimon Peres, Elie Wiesel, etc.  Alas, not having known about it, I already planned my travel in a way that won’t let me attend it.  I feel a little like the guy in <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/local.theonion.com/local-jew-feels-left-out-of-worldwide-jewish-conspiracy-1819564292/amp">this Onion article</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Updates:</strong><br /><a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4536#jan18">Saturday January 18</a><br /><a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4536#jan19">Sunday January 19</a><br /><a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4536#jan20">Monday January 20</a><br /><a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4536#jan21">Tuesday January 21</a></p>



<p>It would be great to know whether anyone’s actually reading the later updates, so I know whether to continue putting effort into them!</p>



<h2><a name="jan18">Saturday January 18</a></h2>



<p>Today I’m headed to the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2020">50th World Economic Forum in Davos</a>, where on Tuesday I’ll participate in a <a href="https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2020/sessions/the-quantum-potential">panel discussion</a> on “The Quantum Potential” with Jeremy O’Brien of the quantum computing startup <a href="https://psiquantum.com/">PsiQuantum</a>, and will also host an ask-me-anything session about quantum computational supremacy and Google’s claim to have achieved it.</p>



<p>I’m well aware that this will be unlike any other conference I’ve ever attended: STOC or FOCS it ain’t.  As one example, also speaking on Tuesday—although not conflicting with my QC sessions—will be a real-estate swindler and reality-TV star who’s somehow (alas) the current President of the United States.  Yes, even while his impeachment trial in the Senate gets underway.  <em>Also</em> speaking on Tuesday, a mere hour and a half after him, will be TIME’s Person of the Year, 17-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg.</p>



<p>In short, this Davos is shaping up to be an epic showdown between two diametrically opposed visions for the future of life on Earth.  And your humble blogger will be right there in the middle of it, to … uhh … explain how quantum computers can sample probability distributions that are classically intractable unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level.  I feel appropriately sheepish.</p>



<p>Since the experience will be so unusual for me, I’m planning to <strong>“live-blog Davos”</strong>: I’ll be updating this post, all week, with any strange new things that I see or learn.  As a sign of my devotion to you, my loyal readers, I’ll even clothespin my nose and attend Trump’s speech so I can write about it.</p>



<p>And Greta: on the off chance that you happen to read <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>, let me treat you to a vegan lunch or dinner!  I’d like to try to persuade you of just how essential nuclear power will be to a carbon-free future.  Oh, and if it’s not too much trouble, I’d also like a selfie with you for this blog.  (Alas, a friend pointed out to me that it would probably be easier to meet Trump: unlike Greta, he won’t be swarmed with thousands of fans!)</p>



<p>Anyway, check back here throughout the week for updates.  And if you’re in Davos and would like to meet, please shoot me an email.  And please use the comment section to give me your advice, suggestions, well-wishes, requests, or important messages for me to fail to deliver to the “Davoisie” who run the world.</p>



<h2><a name="jan19">Sunday January 19</a></h2>



<p>So I’ve arrived in Klosters, a village in the Swiss Alps close to Davos where I’ll be staying.  (All the hotels in Davos itself were booked by the time I checked.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4543" /></figure>



<p>I’d braced myself for the challenge of navigating three different trains through the Alps not knowing German.  In reality, it was like a hundred times easier than public transportation at home.  Every train arrived at the exact right second at the exact platform that was listed, bearing the exact right number, and there were clear visible signs strategically placed at exactly the places where anyone could get confused.  I’d entered Bizarro Opposite World.  I’m surely one of the more absentminded people on earth, as well as one of the more neurotic about being judged by bystanders if I ever admit to being lost, and it was nothing.</p>



<p>Snow!  Once a regular part of my life, now the first I’d seen in several years.  Partly because I now live in Texas, but also because even when we take the kids back to Pennsylvania for ChanuChrismaNewYears, it no longer snows like it did when I was a kid.  If you show my 2-year-old, Daniel, a picture of snow-covered wilderness, he calls it a “beach.”  Daniel’s soon-to-be 7-year-old sister still remembers snow from Boston, but the memory is rapidly fading.  I wonder for how many of the children of the 21st century will snow just be a thing from old books and movies, like typewriters of rotary phones.</p>



<p>The World Economic Forum starts tomorrow afternoon.  In the meantime, though, I thought I’d give an update not on the WEF itself, but on the inflight movie that I watched on my way here.</p>



<p>I watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2066051/">Rocketman</a>, the recent biopic/hagiography about Elton John, though as I watched I found that I kept making comparisons between Elton John and Greta Thunberg.</p>



<p>On the surface, these two <em>might</em> not seem to have a great deal of similarity.</p>



<p>But I gathered that they had this in common: while still teenagers, they saw a chance and they seized it.  And doing so involved taking inner turmoil and then succesfully externalizing it to the whole planet.  Making hundreds of millions of people feel the same emotions that they had felt.  If I’m being painfully honest (how often am I not?), that’s something I’ve always wanted to achieve and haven’t.</p>



<p>Of course, when some of the most intense and distinctive emotions you’ve ever felt revolved around the discovery of quantum query complexity lower bounds … yeah, it might be tough to find more people than could fill a room to relive <em>those</em> emotional journeys with you.  But a child’s joy at discovering numbers like Ackerman(100) (to say nothing of BB(100)), which are so incomprehensibly bigger than \( 9^{9^{9^{9^9}}} \) that I didn’t need to think twice about how many 9’s I put there?  Or the exasperation at those who, yeah, totally get that quantum computers aren’t known to give exponential speedups for NP-complete problems, that’s a really important clarification coming from the theory side, but still, let’s continue to base our entire business or talk or article around the presupposition that quantum computers <strong>do</strong> give exponential speedups for NP-complete problems?  Or even just the type of crush that comes with a ceaseless monologue about what an objectifying, misogynist pig you must be to experience it?  Maybe I could someday make people vicariously experience and understand <em>those</em> emotions–if I could only find the right words.</p>



<p>My point is, this is precisely what Greta did for the burgeoning emotion of existential terror about the Anthropocene—another emotion that’s characterized my over life since childhood.  Not that I ever figured out anything to do about it, with the exception of <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=278">Gore/Nader vote-swapping</a>.  By the standards of existential terrors, I consider this terror to be extraordinarily well-grounded.  If Steven Weinberg is scared, who among us has the right to be calm?</p>



<p>The obvious objection to Greta—why should anyone care what a histrionic teenager thinks about a complicated scientific field that thousands of people get PhDs in?—calls for a substantive answer.  So here’s mine.  Like many concerned citizens, I try to absorb some of the research on ocean warming or the collapse of ice sheets and the melting permafrost leading to even more warming or the collapse of ecosystems due to changes in rainfall or bushfires or climate migrations or whatever.  And whenever I do, I’m reminded of Richard Feynman’s remark, during the investigation of the Challenger disaster, that maybe it wasn’t all that interesting for the commission to spend its time reconstructing the exact details of which system caused which other system to malfunction at which millisecond, <strong>after the Space Shuttle had already started exploding.</strong>  The thing was hosed at that point.</p>



<p>Still, even after the 80s and 90s, there remained deep open questions about the eventual shape of the climate crisis, and foremost among them was: how do you get people to stop talking about this crisis in the language of intellectual hypotheticals and meaningless virtue-signalling gestures and “those crazy scientists, who knows what they’ll say tomorrow”?  How does one get people to revert to a more ancient language, the one that was used to win WWII for example, which speaks of courage and duty and heroism and defiance in the jaws of death?</p>



<p>Greta’s origin story—the one where the autistic girl spends months so depressed over climate inaction that she can’t eat or leave her room, until finally, no longer able to bear the psychic burden, she ditches school and carries a handmade protest sign to the front of the Swedish parliament—is not merely a prerequisite to a real contribution.  It <em>is</em> Greta’s real contribution (so far anyway), and by that I don’t mean to diminish it.  The idea was “trivial,” yes, but only in the sense that the wheel, Arabic numerals, or “personal computers will be important” were trivial ideas.  Greta modeled for the rest of the world how they, too, would probably feel about climate change were they able to sync up their lizard brains with their higher brains … and crucially, a substantial segment of the world was already primed to agree with her.  But it needed to see <em>one successful example</em> of a succesful sync between the science and the emotions appropriate to the science, as a crystal needs a seed.</p>



<p>The thesis of Rocketman is that Elton John’s great achievement was not only to invent a new character, but <em>actually to become that character</em>, since only by succesfully fusing the two could he touch the emotions of the masses.  In a similar way, Greta Thunberg’s great accomplishment of her short life has been to make herself into the human race’s first Greta Thunberg.</p>



<h2><a name="jan20">Monday January 20</a></h2>



<p>Happy 7th birthday to my daughter Lily!  (No, I didn’t miss her birthday party.  We did it on the 18th, right before I flew out.)</p>



<p>I think my goals for Davos have been downgraded from delivering a message of peace and nerd liberation to the world’s powerful, or even getting a selfie with Greta, to simply taking in a week in an environment that’s so alien to me.</p>



<p>Everything in Davos is based on a tiered system of badges, which determine which buildings you can get into to participate in the sessions.  I have a white badge, the highest tier, which would’ve set me back around <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/costs-of-davos-2011-1?r=US&amp;IR=T">$71,000</a> had WEF not thankfully waived its fees for academics.  I should mention that I’m also extremely underdressed compared to most of the people here, and that I spent much of my time today looking for free food.  It turns out that there’s pretty copious and excellent free food, although the sponsors sometimes ask you to leave your business card before you take any.  I don’t have a business card.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4546" /></figure>



<p>The above, for me, represents the true spirit of Davos: a conference at a Swiss ski resort that costs $71,000 to attend, held on behalf of the ideal of human equality.</p>



<p>But maybe I shouldn’t scoff.  I learned today about a war between Greece and Turkey that was averted only because the heads of the two countries talked it over at Davos, so that’s cool.  At the opening ceremony today, besides a beautiful orchestral rendition of “Ode to Joy,” there were a bunch of speeches about how Davos pioneered the entire concept of corporate social responsibility.  I suppose the critics might say instead that Davos pioneered the concept of corporate <em>whitewashing</em>—as with the wall-sized posters that I saw this afternoon, wherein a financial services corporation showcased a diverse cast of people each above their preferred pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them).  Amazing how pronouns make everything woke and social-justicey!  I imagine that the truth is somewhere between these visions.  Just like the easiest way for NASA to <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4267">fake</a> a moon landing was actually to send humans to the moon, sometimes the easiest way to virtue-signal is actually to become more virtuous.</p>



<p>Tonight I went to a reception specifically for the academics at Davos.  There, for the first time since my arrival, I saw people who I knew (Shafi Goldwasser, Neha Narula…), and met someone who I’d known by reputation (Brian Schmidt, who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of dark energy).  But even the people who I didn’t know were clearly “my people,” with familiar nerdy mannerisms and interests, and in some cases even a thorough knowledge of SlateStarCodex references.  Imagine visiting a foreign country where no one spoke your language, then suddenly stumbling on the first ones who did.  I found it a hundred times easier than at the main conference to strike up conversations.</p>



<p>Oh yeah, quantum computing.  This afternoon I hosted three roundtable discussions about  quantum computing, which were fun and stress-free — I spent <em>much</em> more of my mental energy today figuring out the shuttle buses.  If you’re a regular reader of this blog or my popular articles, or a watcher of my talks on YouTube, etc., then congratulations: you’ve gotten the same explanations of quantum computing for free that others may have paid $71,000 apiece to hear!  Tomorrow are my two “real” quantum computing sessions, as well as the speeches by both the Donald and the Greta (the latter being the much hotter ticket).  So it’s a big day, which I’ll tell you about after it’s happened.  Stay tuned!</p>



<h2><a name="jan21">Tuesday January 21</a></h2>



<p>PsiQuantum’s Jeremy O’Brien and I did the Davos quantum computing panel this morning (moderated by Jennifer Schenker).  You can watch our 45-minute panel <a href="https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2020/sessions/the-quantum-potential">here</a>.  For regular readers of this blog, the territory will be familiar, but I dunno, I hope someone enjoys it anyway!</p>



<p>I’m now in the Congress Hall, in a seat near the front, waiting for Trump to arrive.  I will listen to the President of the United States and not attract the Secret Service’s attention by loudly booing, but I have no intention to stand or applaud either.</p>



<p>Alas, getting a seat at Greta’s talk is looking like it will be difficult or impossible.</p>



<p>I was struck by the long runup to Trump’s address: the President of Switzerland gave a searing speech about the existential threats of climate change and ecosystem destruction, and “the politicians in many nations who appeal to fear and bigotry”—never mentioning Trump by name but making clear that she despised the entire ideology of the man people had come to hear.  I thought it was a nice touch.  Then some technicians spent 15 minutes adjusting Trump’s podium, then nothing happened for 20 minutes as we all waited for a tardy Trump, then some traditional Swiss singers did a performance on stage (!), and finally Klaus Schwab, director of the WEF, gave Trump a brief and coldly cordial introduction, joking about the weather in Davos. </p>



<p>And … now Trump is finally speaking.  Once he starts, I suddenly realize that I have no idea what new insight I expected from this.  He’s giving his standard stump speech, America has regained its footing after the disaster of the previous administration, winning like it’s never won before, unemployment is the lowest in recorded history, blah blah blah.  I estimate that less than half of the audience applauded Trump’s entrance; the rest sat in stony silence.  Meanwhile, some people were passing out flyers to the audience documenting all the egregious errors in Trump’s economic statistics.</p>



<p>Given the small and childish nature of the remarks (“we’re the best!  ain’t no one gonna push us around!”), it feels somehow right to be looking down at my phone, blogging, rather than giving my undivided attention to the President of the United States speaking 75 feet in front of me.</p>



<p>Ok, I admit I just looked up, when Trump mentioned America’s commitment to developing new technologies like “5G and quantum computing” (he slowly drew out the word “quantum”).</p>



<p>His whole delivery is strangely lethargic, as if he didn’t sleep well last night (I didn’t either).</p>



<p>Trump announced that the US would be joining the WEF’s “1 trillion trees” environmental initiative, garnering the only applause in his speech.  But he then immediately pivoted to a denunciation of the “doomsayers and pessimists and socialists who want to control our lives and take away our liberty” (he presumably meant people worried about climate change).</p>



<p>Now, I kid you not, Trump is expanding on his “optimism” theme by going on and on about the architectural achievements of Renaissance Florence.</p>



<p>You can watch Trump’s speech for yourself <a href="https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2020/sessions/special-address-by-donald-j-trump-president-of-the-united-states-of-america-5e6010c5e7">here</a>.</p>



<p>While I wasn’t able to get in to see Greta Thunberg in person, you can watch her (along with others) <a href="https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2020/sessions/averting-a-climate-apocalypse">here</a>.  I learned that her name is pronounced “toon-berg.”</p>


<p>Having now listened to Greta’s remarks, I confess that I disagree with the content of what she says.  She explicitly advocates a sort of purity-based carbon absolutism—demanding that companies and governments immediately implement, not merely <em>net</em> zero emissions (i.e. offsetting their emissions by paying to plant trees and so forth), but zero emissions <em>period.  </em>Since she can’t possibly mean <em>literally</em> zero, I’ll interpret her to mean close to zero.  Even so, it seems to me that the resulting economic upheavals would provoke a massive backlash against whoever tried to enforce such a policy.  Greta also dismisses the idea of technological solutions to climate change, saying that we don’t have time to invent such solutions.  But of course, some of the solutions already exist—a prime example being nuclear power.  And if we no longer have time to nuclearize the world, then to a great extent, that’s the fault of the antinuclear activists—an unbelievable moral and strategic failure that may have doomed our civilization, and for which there’s never been a reckoning.</p>


<p>Despite all my disagreements, <em>if</em> Greta’s strident, uncompromising rhetoric helps push the world toward cutting emissions, then she’ll have to be counted as one of the greatest people who ever lived.  Of course, another possibility is the world’s leaders will applaud her and celebrate her moral courage, while not taking anything beyond token actions.</p></div>

<h2>A mathematical context (of one corner of the work) and wish list: stability theory for groups.</h2>

<p>And (thanks Mikael de la Salle!) a recent Book by Gilles Pisier:<br />
<a href="https://www.math.tamu.edu/~pisier/TPCOS.pdf">Tensor products of <em>C*</em>-algebras and operator spaces; </a><a href="https://www.math.tamu.edu/~pisier/TPCOS.pdf">The Connes-Kirchberg problem</a></p>
<p>The assertion of Connes’ embedding conjecture refuted in the MIP*=RE paper would imply several (<a href="https://mathoverflow.net/a/350559/1532">outrageous</a> :)) stronger conjectures that are still open. One is the conjecture of Connes that every group is “hyperlinear.” Another famous conjecture (an affirmative answer to a question posed by Gromov) is  that every group is sofic. As sofic groups are hyperlinear we can now expect (ever more than before) that non-sofic and even non hyperlinear groups will be found. Here is a rough short explanation what these conjectures are about. <del>(Kirchberg’s conjecture, is another group theoretic question of this nature.)</del></p>
<p>Every finite group is a permutation group and is a linear group. This is not the case for infinite groups and there are various interesting notions of “approximately-permutation-group” (this is “sofic”) and “approximately linear” (this is called “hyperlinear”).</p>
<p>Given a group Γ we want to find a sequence of functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f_n" class="latex" title="f_n" /></p>
<ol>
<li>From Γ to symmetric groups <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S_n" class="latex" title="S_n" />,</li>
<li>or from Γ to the unitary groups <em>U(n).</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Such that asymptotically as <em>n</em> grows these functions are “almost homomorphisms” with respect to certain metrics <em>DIST</em> on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S_n" class="latex" title="S_n" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="U(n)" class="latex" title="U(n)" /> respectively. This means that for every two elements</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2Cb+%5Cin+%5CGamma&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="a,b \in \Gamma" class="latex" title="a,b \in \Gamma" />,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=DIST%28+f_n%28ab%29%2C+f_n%28a%29f_n%28b%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="DIST( f_n(ab), f_n(a)f_n(b))" class="latex" title="DIST( f_n(ab), f_n(a)f_n(b))" /> tends to zero when <em>n</em> tends to infinity.</p>
<p>Now,</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sofic group</strong> refers to the normalized Hamming metric for symmetric groups.</li>
<li><strong>Hyperlinear group</strong> refers to metrics given by the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt norm on the unitary groups</li>
<li><strong>MF-groups, </strong>Again the unitary group but the operator norm this time.</li>
</ol>
<p>And there are various other metrics that were also considered. The assertion of the famous embedding conjecture by Connes on von-Neumann algebras (now refuted by the new result) implies that every group is hyperlinear.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">A remaining wish list: Find a non sofic group; find a non-hyperlinear group; <del>refute  Kirchberg’s conjecture (if it was not already refuted)</del>.</span></strong></p>
<h2>Interactive proofs and some computational complexity background.</h2>
<h3>P, NP, IP, MIP</h3>
<p><em>Links: here are slides of  a great talk by Yael Kalai: <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/the-evolution-of-proofs-in-computer-science-yael-kalai.pptx">The evolution of proof in computer science;</a> an a <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2012/09/18/the-evolution-of-proofs/">blog post on this topic</a> by Yael Kalai, and a <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/01/06/yael-tauman-kalais-icm2018-paper-my-paper-and-cryptography/">post here</a> about Yael’s 2018 ICM paper and lecture.</em></p>
<p>A decision problem is in P if there is a polynomial time algorithm (in terms of the input size) to test if the answer is yes or no.  A decision problem is in NP if there is a proof for a YES answer that can be verified in a polynomial time.</p>
<p>Here are two examples: The question if  graph has a perfect matching is in P. The question if  graph has an Hamiltonian cycle  is in NP. If the answer is yes a prover can give a proof that requires the verifier a polynomial number of steps to verify.</p>
<p>IP is a complexity class based on a notion of interactive proof where, based on a protocol for questions and answers,  the prover can convince the verifier (with arbitrary high probability) that the answer is yes. Following a sequence of startling developments Adi Shamir proved that IP is quite a large complexity space P-space.  When we consider several non-interacting provers (two provers suffice) the computational power denoted by MIP is even larger: László Babai, Lance Fortnow, and Cartsen Lund proved that MIP=NEXP!  NEXP is the class of decision problems where if the answer is yes a prover can give a proof that requires the verifier (at most) an exponential number of steps to verify.</p>
<h3>Enters quantum computation and entanglement</h3>
<p>We replace the model of classical computation with quantum computation. Each of the two provers, Prover1 and Prover2, have access to separate sets of <em>m</em> qubits but they  can prepare in advance a complicated quantum state on those <em>2m</em> qubits. When we run the verification protocol each prover has access only to its <em>m</em> qubits and, like in the classical case,  the two provers cannot communicate. These types of verification protocols represent the complexity class MIP*.  In 2012 and Tsuyoshi Ito and Thomas Vidick proved that MIP* contains NEXP. In <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2012/07/16/some-updates/">this 2012 post</a> I reported an unusual seminar we ran on the problem.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Interactive quantum lecture:</strong> We had an unususal quantum seminar presentation by Michael Ben-Or on the work <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0550">A multi-prover interactive proof for NEXP sound against entangled provers</a> by Tsuyoshi Ito and Thomas Vidick. Michael ran Vidick’s videotaped recent talk on the matter and from time to time he and Dorit acted as a pair of prover and the other audience as verifier. (Michael was one of the authors of the very first paper introducing multi-prover interactive proofs.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me mention also a related 2014 paper by Yael Kalai, Ran Raz, and Ron Rothblum: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/delegate-computations-power-no-signaling-proofs/">How to delegate computations: the power of no-signaling proofs.</a> They considered two provers that are limited by the “non-signaling principle” and showed that the power of interactive proofs is exactly EXP . (Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FiroQt6yWc">videotaped lecture</a> by Ran Raz.)</p>
<p>In April 2019, Anand Natarajan and John Wright uploaded a paper with a proof that MIP* contain NEEXP. (NEEXP is the class of decision problems where if the answer is yes a prover can give a proof that requires the verifier (at most) doubly exponential number of steps to verify.)</p>
<p>Here is a nice quote from the <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-expand-the-frontier-of-verifiable-knowledge-20190523/">Harnett’s  quanta paper</a> regarding the Natarajan-Wright breakthrough:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some problems are too hard to solve in any reasonable amount of time. But their solutions are easy to check. Given that, computer scientists want to know: How complicated can a problem be while still having a solution that can be verified?</p>
<p>Turns out, the answer is: Almost unimaginably complicated.</p>
<p>In a paper released in April, two computer scientists <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05870" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dramatically increased the number of problems</a> that fall into the hard-to-solve-but-easy-to-verify category. They describe a method that makes it possible to check answers to problems of almost incomprehensible complexity. “It seems insane,” said <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Vidick</a>, a computer scientist at the California Institute of Technology who wasn’t involved in the new work.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Now with the new result, I wonder if this bold  philosophical interpretation is sensible:  There is a shared quantum state that will allow two non-interacting provers (with unlimited computational power) to convince  a mathematician if a given mathematical statement has a proof, and also to convince a historian or a futurist about any question regarding the past or future evolution of the universe.</em></p>
<h3>What is RE?</h3>
<p>(I forgot to explain what RE is. Here is the description from the paper itself.)</p>
<p>RE is the class of recursively enumerable languages, i.e. languages <em>L</em> such that there<br />
exists a Turing machine <em>M</em> such that <em>x ∈ L</em> if and only if <em>M</em> halts and accepts on input <em>x</em>. Note that, in addition to containing all decidable languages, this class also contains undecidable problems such as the Halting problem, which is to decide whether a given Turing machine eventually halts</p>
<h3>A little more information and links</h3>
<p>The negative answer to Tsirelson problem asserts roughly that there are types of correlations  that can be produced by an infinite quantum systems, but that can’t even be approximated by a finite system. Connes’ 1976 embedding conjecture (now refuted) from the theory of von Neumann algebras asserts that “Every  type <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPi_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\Pi_1" class="latex" title="\Pi_1" /> von Neumann factor embeds in an ultrapower of a hyperfinite <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPi_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\Pi_1" class="latex" title="\Pi_1" /> factor.”</p>
<p>The abstract of the new paper mentions a few other works that are important for the new proof.</p>

In the field of constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), promise CSPs are an exciting new direction of study. In a promise CSP, each constraint comes in two forms: "strict" and "weak," and in the associated decision problem one must distinguish between being able to satisfy all the strict constraints versus not being able to satisfy all the weak constraints. The most commonly cited example of a promise CSP is the approximate graph coloring problem--which has recently seen exciting progress [BKO19, WZ20] benefiting from a systematic algebraic approach to promise CSPs based on "polymorphisms," operations that map tuples in the strict form of each constraint to tuples in the corresponding weak form.

In this work, we present a simple algorithm which in polynomial time solves the decision problem for all promise CSPs that admit infinitely many symmetric polymorphisms, that is the coordinates are permutation invariant. This generalizes previous work of the first two authors [BG19]. We also extend this algorithm to a more general class of block-symmetric polymorphisms. As a corollary, this single algorithm solves all polynomial-time tractable Boolean CSPs simultaneously. These results give a new perspective on Schaefer's classic dichotomy theorem and shed further light on how symmetries of polymorphisms enable algorithms. Finally, we show that block symmetric polymorphisms are not only sufficient but also necessary for this algorithm to work, thus establishing its precise power.</div>

<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from

<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p><strong>Scott’s preface:</strong> Imagine that every time you turned your blog over to a certain topic, you got denounced on Twitter and Reddit as a privileged douchebro, entitled STEMlord, counterrevolutionary bourgeoisie, etc. etc.  The sane response would simply be to quit blogging about that topic.  But there’s also an <em>in</em>sane (or masochistic?) response: the response that says, “but if everyone like me stopped talking, we’d cede the field by default to the loudest, angriest voices on all sides—thereby giving those voices exactly what they wanted.  To hell with that!”</p>



<p>A few weeks ago, while I was being attacked for sharing Steven Pinker’s <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4476">guest post</a> about NIPS vs. NeurIPS, I received a beautiful message of support from a PhD student in physical chemistry and quantum computing named <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/karen-morenz-189310112">Karen Morenz</a>.  Besides her strong words of encouragement, Karen wanted to share with me an <a href="https://medium.com/@kjmorenz/is-it-really-just-sexism-an-alternative-argument-for-why-women-leave-stem-cccdf066d8b1">essay</a> she had written on Medium about why too many women leave STEM.</p>



<p>Karen’s essay, I found, marshaled data, logic, and her own experience in support of an insight that strikes me as true and important and underappreciated—one that dovetails with what I’ve heard from many other women in STEM fields, including my wife <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~danama/">Dana</a>.  So I asked Karen for permission to reprint her essay on this blog, and she graciously agreed.</p>



<p>Briefly: anyone with a brain and a soul wants there to be many more women in STEM.  Karen outlines a realistic way to achieve this shared goal.  Crucially, Karen’s way is <em>not</em> about shaming male STEM nerds for their deep-seated misogyny, their arrogant mansplaining, or their gross, creepy, predatory sexual desires.  Yes, you can go the shaming route (God knows it’s being tried).  If you do, you’ll probably snare many guys who really do deserve to be shamed as creeps or misogynists, along with many more who don’t.  Yet for all your efforts, Karen predicts, you’ll no more solve the original problem of too few women in STEM, than arresting the kulaks solved the problem of lifting the masses out of poverty.</p>



<p>For you still won’t have made a dent in the real issue: namely that, the way we’ve set things up, pursuing an academic STEM career demands fanatical devotion, to the exclusion of nearly everything else in life, between the ages of roughly 18 and 35.  And as long as that’s true, Karen says, the majority of talented women are going to look at academic STEM, in light of all the other great options available to them, and say “no thanks.”  Solving this problem might look like more money for maternity leave and childcare.  It might also look like re-imagining the academic career trajectory itself, to make it easier to rejoin it after five or ten years away.  Way back in 2006, I tried to make this point in a blog post called <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=87">Nerdify the world, and the women will follow</a>.  I’m grateful to Karen for making it more cogently than I did.</p>



<p>Without further ado, here’s Karen’s essay. –SA</p>



<h3><strong>Is it really just sexism?  An alternative argument for why women leave STEM</strong></h3>



<p>by Karen Morenz</p>



<p>Everyone knows that you’re not supposed to start your argument with ‘everyone knows,’ but in this case, I think we ought to make an exception:</p>



<p>Everyone knows that STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) has a problem retaining women (see, for example <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283809613_Women_in_STEM_Family-Related_Challenges_and_Initiatives" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jean, Payne, and Thompson 2015</a>). We pour money into attracting girls and women to STEM fields. We pour money into recruiting women, training women, and addressing sexism, both overt and subconscious. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5491652/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In 2011</a>, the United States spent nearly $3 billion tax dollars on STEM education, of which roughly one third was spent supporting and encouraging underrepresented groups to enter STEM (including women). And yet, women are still leaving at alarming rates.</p>



<p>Alarming? Isn’t that a little, I don’t know, alarmist? Well, <strong>let’s look at some stats.</strong></p>



<p>A recent report by the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0894845313483003" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Science Foundation (2011)</a> found that women received 20.3% of the bachelor’s degrees and 18.6% of the PhD degrees in physics in 2008. In chemistry, women earned 49.95% of the bachelor’s degrees but only 36.1% of the doctoral degrees. By comparison, in biology women received 59.8% of the bachelor’s degrees and 50.6% of the doctoral degrees. A <a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i10/why-cant-the-drug-industry-solve-its-gender-diversity-problem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent article</a> in Chemical and Engineering News showed a chart based on a survey of life sciences workers by Liftstream and MassBio demonstrating how women are vastly underrepresented in science leadership despite earning degrees at similar rates, which I’ve copied below. The story is the same in academia, as you can see on the <a href="https://eige.europa.eu/sites/default/files/garcia_working_paper_5_academic_careers_gender_inequality.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second chart</a> — from comparable or even larger number of women at the student level, we move towards a significantly larger proportion of men at the more and more advanced stages of an academic career.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*X0Pt4nHwU9JiVN0RDyb1sQ.png" alt="" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/697/1*vx6M8mBvhk0pYtNq3B06fg.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Although 74% of women in STEM <a href="http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/legacy/pdf/NCWIT_TheFacts_rev2010.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> “loving their work,” half (56%, in fact) leave over the course of their career — largely at the “mid-level” point, when the loss of their talent is most costly as they have just completed training and begun to contribute maximally to the work force.</p>



<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01511" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A study by Dr. Flaherty</a> found that women who obtain faculty position in astronomy spent on average 1 year less than their male counterparts between completing their PhD and obtaining their position — but he concluded that this is because <strong>women leave the field at a rate 3 to 4 times greater than men</strong>, and in particular, if they do not obtain a faculty position quickly, will simply move to another career. So, women and men are hired at about the same rate during the early years of their post docs, but women stop applying to academic positions and drop out of the field as time goes on, pulling down the average time to hiring for women.</p>



<p>There are many more studies to this effect. At this point, <strong>the assertion that women leave STEM at an alarming rate after obtaining PhDs is nothing short of an established fact</strong>. In fact, it’s actually a problem across all academic disciplines, as you can see in <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/11/leaky-pipelines-for-canadian-women-in-research.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this matching chart</a> showing the same phenomenon in humanities, social sciences, and education. The phenomenon has been affectionately dubbed the “leaky pipeline.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/571/0*koOEWDCY2BBSvZCN" alt="" /></figure>



<p><strong>But hang on a second, maybe there just aren’t enough women qualified for the top levels of STEM? Maybe it’ll all get better in a few years if we just wait around doing nothing?</strong></p>



<p>Nope, sorry. This <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/women-and-men-in-stem-often-at-odds-over-workplace-equity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> says that 41% of highly qualified STEM people are female. And also, it’s clear from the previous charts and stats that a significantly larger number of women are getting PhDs than going on the be professors, in comparison to their male counterparts. <a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i10/why-cant-the-drug-industry-solve-its-gender-diversity-problem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Laurie Glimcher</a>, when she started her professorship at Harvard University in the early 1980s, remembers seeing very few women in leadership positions. “I thought, ‘Oh, this is really going to change dramatically,’ ” she says. But 30 years later, “it’s not where I expected it to be.” Her experiences are similar to those of other leading female faculty.</p>



<p><strong>So what gives? Why are all the STEM women leaving?</strong></p>



<p>It is widely believed that sexism is the leading problem. A quick google search of “sexism in STEM” will turn up a veritable cornucopia of articles to that effect. And indeed, around 60% of women report experiencing some form of sexism in the last year (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361684315596162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robnett 2016</a>). So, that’s clearly not good.</p>



<p>And yet, if you ask leading women researchers like Nobel Laureate in Physics 2018, Professor Donna Strickland, or Canada Research Chair in Advanced Functional Materials (Chemistry), Professor Eugenia Kumacheva, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p06mrmnt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they</a> <a href="https://www.intermissionmagazine.ca/features/the-scientist-and-the-artist-conversations-with-eugenia-kumacheva-and-fiona-reid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">say</a> that sexism was not a barrier in their careers. Moreover, extensive research has shown that sexism has overall decreased since Professors Strickland and Kumacheva (for example) were starting their careers. Even more interestingly, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361684315596162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Rachael Robnett showed</a> that more mathematical fields such as Physics have a greater problem with sexism than less mathematical fields, such as Chemistry, a finding which rings true with the subjective experience of many women I know in Chemistry and Physics. However, as we saw above, women leave the field of Chemistry in greater proportions following their BSc than they leave Physics. On top of that, although 22% of women <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/women-and-men-in-stem-often-at-odds-over-workplace-equity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> experiencing sexual harassment at work, the proportion is the same among STEM and non-STEM careers, and yet women leave STEM careers at a much higher rate than non-STEM careers.</p>



<p>So,it seems that<strong> sexism can not fully explain why women with STEM PhDs are leaving STEM</strong>. At the point when women have earned a PhD, for the most part they have already survived the worst of the sexism. They’ve already proven themselves to be generally thick-skinned and, as anyone with a PhD can attest, very stubborn in the face of overwhelming difficulties. Sexism is frustrating, and it can limit advancement, but it doesn’t fully explain why we have so many women obtaining PhDs in STEM, and then leaving. In fact, at least in the U of T chemistry department, faculty hires are directly proportional to the applicant pool —although the exact number of applicants are not made public, from public information we can see that approximately one in four interview invitees are women, and approximately one in four hires are women. Our hiring committees have received bias training, and it seems that it has been largely successful. That’s not to say that we’re done, but it’s time to start looking elsewhere to explain why there are so few women sticking around.</p>



<p><strong>So why don’t more women apply?</strong></p>



<p>Well, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/dec/14/many-women-in-stem-fields-expect-to-quit-within-five-years-survey-finds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one truly brilliant researcher</a> had the groundbreaking idea of asking women why they left the field. When you ask women why they left, the number one reason they cite is<strong> balancing work/life responsibilities</strong> — which as far as I can tell is a euphemism for family concerns.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5315093/#FN2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The</a> <a href="http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/legacy/pdf/NCWIT_TheFacts_rev2010.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a> <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/11/leaky-pipelines-for-canadian-women-in-research.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is in</a> <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/women-and-men-in-stem-often-at-odds-over-workplace-equity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on</a> <a href="https://eige.europa.eu/sites/default/files/garcia_working_paper_5_academic_careers_gender_inequality.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this</a>. Women who stay in academia expect to marry later, and delay or completely forego having children, and if they do have children, plan to have fewer than their non-STEM counterparts (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5315093/#FN2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sassler et al 2016</a>, <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/11/leaky-pipelines-for-canadian-women-in-research.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Owens 2012</a>). Men in STEM have no such difference compared to their non-STEM counterparts; they marry and have children about the same ages and rates as their non-STEM counterparts (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5315093/#FN2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sassler et al 2016</a>). Women leave STEM in droves in their early to mid thirties (<a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/women-and-men-in-stem-often-at-odds-over-workplace-equity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Funk and Parker 2018</a>) — the time when women’s fertility begins to decrease, and risks of childbirth complications begin to skyrocket for both mother and child. Men don’t see an effect on their fertility until their mid forties. Of the 56% of women who leave STEM, 50% wind up self-employed or using their training in a not for profit or government, 30% leave to a non-STEM more ‘family friendly’ career, and 20% leave to be stay-at-home moms (<a href="http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/legacy/pdf/NCWIT_TheFacts_rev2010.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ashcraft and Blithe 2002</a>). Meanwhile, institutions with better childcare and maternity leave policies have twice(!) the number of female faculty in STEM (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jan/21/better-maternity-leave-could-help-universities-retain-women-study" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Troeger 2018</a>). In analogy to the affectionately named “leaky pipeline,” the challenge of balancing motherhood and career has been titled the “maternal wall.”</p>



<p><strong>To understand the so-called maternal wall better, let’s take a quick look at the sketch of a typical academic career.</strong></p>



<p>For the sake of this exercise, let’s all pretend to be me. I’m a talented 25 year old PhD candidate studying Physical Chemistry — I use laser spectroscopy to try to understand atypical energy transfer processes in innovative materials that I hope will one day be used to make vastly more efficient solar panels. I got my BSc in Chemistry and Mathematics at the age of 22, and have published 4 scientific papers in two different fields already (Astrophysics and Environmental Chemistry). I’ve got a big scholarship, and a lot of people supporting me to give me the best shot at an academic career — a career I dearly want. But, I also want a family — maybe two or three kids. Here’s what I can expect if I pursue an academic career:</p>



<p>With any luck, 2–3 years from now I’ll graduate with a PhD, at the age of 27. Academics are expected to travel a lot, and to move a lot, especially in their 20s and early 30s — all of the key childbearing years. I’m planning to go on exchange next year, and then the year after that I’ll need to work hard to wrap up research, write a thesis, and travel to several conferences to showcase my work. After I finish my PhD, I’ll need to undertake one or two post doctoral fellowships, lasting one or two years each, probably in completely different places. During that time, I’ll start to apply for professorships. In order to do this, I’ll travel around to conferences to advertise my work and to meet important leaders in my field, and then, if I am invited for interviews, I’ll travel around to different universities for two or three days at a time to undertake these interviews. This usually occurs in a person’s early 30s — our helpful astronomy guy, Dr. Flaherty, found the average time to hiring was 5 years, so let’s say I’m 32 at this point. If offered a position, I’ll spend the next year or two renovating and building a lab, buying equipment, recruiting talented graduate students, and designing and teaching courses. People work really, really hard during this time and have essentially no leisure time. Now I’m 34. Within usually 5 years I’ll need to apply for tenure. This means that by the time I’m 36, I’ll need to be making significant contributions in my field, and then in the final year before applying for tenure, I will once more need to travel to many conferences to promote my work, in order to secure tenure — if I fail to do so, my position at the university would probably be terminated. <strong>Although many universities offer a “tenure extension” in cases where an assistant professor has had a child, this does not solve all of the problems. </strong>Taking a year off during that critical 5 or 6 year period often means that the research “goes bad” — students flounder, projects that were promising get “scooped” by competitors at other institutions, and sometimes, in biology and chemistry especially, experiments literally go bad. You wind up needing to rebuild much more than just a year’s worth of effort.</p>



<p>At no point during this time do I appear stable enough, career-wise, to take even six months off to be pregnant and care for a newborn. Hypothetical future-me is travelling around, or even moving, conducting and promoting my own independent research and training students. As you’re likely aware, very pregnant people and newborns don’t travel well. And academia has a very individualistic and meritocratic culture. Starting at the graduate level, huge emphasis is based on independent research, and independent contributions, rather than valuing team efforts. This feature of academia is both a blessing and a curse. The individualistic culture means that people have the independence and the freedom to pursue whatever research interests them — in fact this is the main draw for me personally. But it also means that there is often no one to fall back on when you need extra support, and because of biological constraints, this winds up impacting women more than men.</p>



<p>At this point, I need to make sure that you’re aware of some basics of female reproductive biology. According to Wikipedia, the unquestionable source of all reliable knowledge, at age 25, my risk of conceiving a baby with chromosomal abnormalities (including Down’s Syndrome) is 1 in about 1400. By 35, that risk more than quadruples to 1 in 340. At 30, I have a 75% chance of a successful birth in one year, but by 35 it has dropped to 66%, and by 40 it’s down to 44%. Meanwhile, 87 to 94% of women report at least 1 health problem immediately after birth, and 1.5% of mothers have a severe health problem, while 31% have long-term persistent health problems as a result of pregnancy (defined as lasting more than six months after delivery). Furthermore, mothers over the age of 35 are at higher risk for pregnancy complications like preterm delivery, hypertension, superimposed preeclampsia, severe preeclampsia (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4418963/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cavazos-Rehg et al 2016</a>). Because of factors like these, pregnancies in women over 35 are known as “geriatric pregnancies” due to the drastically increased risk of complications. This tight timeline for births is often called the “biological clock” — if women want a family, they basically need to start before 35. Now, that’s not to say it’s impossible to have a child later on, and in fact some studies show that it has positive impacts on the child’s mental health. But it is riskier.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/270/0*UnDt9Luls2Ic_4BD" alt="" /></figure>



<p>So, women with a PhD in STEM know that they have the capability to make interesting contributions to STEM, and to make plenty of money doing it. They usually marry someone who also has or expects to make a high salary as well. But this isn’t the only consideration. Such highly educated women are usually aware of the biological clock and the risks associated with pregnancy, and are confident in their understanding of statistical risks.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ria.ie/sites/default/files/report_final_version-1_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Irish</a> say, “The common challenge facing young women is achieving a satisfactory work-life balance, especially when children are small. From a career perspective, this period of parenthood (which after all is relatively short compared to an entire working life) tends to coincide exactly with the critical point at which an individual’s career may or may not take off. […] All the evidence shows that it is at this point that women either drop out of the workforce altogether, switch to part-time working or move to more family-friendly jobs, which may be less demanding and which do not always utilise their full skillset.”</p>



<p>And in the <a href="https://eige.europa.eu/sites/default/files/garcia_working_paper_5_academic_careers_gender_inequality.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netherlands</a>, “The research project in Tilburg also showed that women academics have more often no children or fewer children than women outside academia.” Meanwhile in <a href="https://eige.europa.eu/sites/default/files/garcia_working_paper_5_academic_careers_gender_inequality.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Italy</a> “On a personal level, the data show that for a significant number of women there is a trade-off between family and work: a large share of female economists in Italy do not live with a partner and do not have children”</p>



<p>Most jobs available to women with STEM PhDs offer greater stability and a larger salary earlier in the career. Moreover, most non-academic careers have less emphasis on independent research, meaning that employees usually work within the scope of a larger team, and so if a person has to take some time off, there are others who can help cover their workload. <a href="http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/legacy/pdf/NCWIT_TheFacts_rev2010.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>By and large</strong></a><strong>, women leave to go to a career where they will be stable, well funded, and well supported, even if it doesn’t fulfill their passion for STEM — or they leave to be stay-at-home moms or self-employed.</strong></p>



<p>I would presume that if we made academia a more feasible place for a woman with a family to work, we could keep almost all of those 20% of leavers who leave to just stay at home, almost all of the 30% who leave to self-employment, and all of those 30% who leave to more family friendly careers (after all, if academia were made to be as family friendly as other careers, there would be no incentive to leave). Of course, there is nothing wrong with being a stay at home parent — it’s an admirable choice and contributes greatly to our society. <a href="https://www.salary.com/articles/stay-at-home-mom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">One estimate</a> valued the equivalent salary benefit of stay-at-home parenthood at about $160,000/year. <a href="https://www.ssb.no/forskning/discussion-papers/_attachment/113165?_ts=13ea1e1e480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Moreover</a>, children with a stay-at-home parent show long term benefits such as better school performance — something that most academic women would want for their children. <strong>But a lot of people only choose it out of necessity — about half of stay-at-home moms would prefer to be working </strong>(<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10834-017-9534-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ciciolla, Curlee, &amp; Luthar 2017</a>). When the reality is that your salary is barely more than the cost of daycare, then a lot of people wind up giving up and staying home with their kids rather than paying for daycare. In a heterosexual couple it will usually be the woman that winds up staying home since she is the one who needs to do things like breast feed anyways. And so we lose these women from the workforce.</p>



<p>And yet, somehow, during this informal research adventure of mine, most scholars and policy makers seem to be advising that we try to encourage young girls to be interested in STEM, and to address sexism in the workplace, with the implication that this will fix the high attrition rate in STEM women. But from what I’ve found, <strong>the stats don’t back up sexism as the main reason women leave</strong>. There is sexism, and that is a problem, and women do leave STEM because of it — but it’s a problem that we’re already dealing with pretty successfully, and it’s not why the majority of women who have already obtained STEM PhDs opt to leave the field. The whole family planning thing is huge and for some reason, almost totally swept under the rug — mostly because we’re too shy to talk about it, I think.</p>



<p>In fact, I think that the plethora of articles suggesting that the problem is sexism actually contribute to our unwillingness to talk about the family planning problem, because it reinforces the perception that that men in power will not hire a woman for fear that she’ll get pregnant and take time off. <strong>Why would anyone talk about how they want to have a family when they keep hearing that even the mere suggestion of such a thing will limit their chances of being hired?</strong> I personally know women who have avoided bringing up the topic with colleagues or supervisors for fear of professional repercussions. So we spend all this time and energy talking about how sexism is really bad, and very little time trying to address the family planning challenge, because, I guess, as the stats show, if women are serious enough about science then they just give up on the family (except for the really, really exceptional ones who can handle the stresses of both simultaneously).</p>



<p>To be very clear, I’m not saying that sexism is not a problem. What I am saying is that, thanks to the sustained efforts of a large number of people over a long period of time, we’ve reduced the sexism problem to the point where, at least at the graduate level, it is no longer the largest major barrier to women’s advancement in STEM. <strong>Hurray! </strong>That does not mean that we should stop paying attention to the issue of sexism, but does mean that <strong>it’s time to start paying more attention to other issues</strong>, like how to properly support women who want to raise a family while also maintaining a career in STEM.</p>



<p><strong>So what can we do to better support STEM women who want families?</strong></p>



<p>A couple of solutions have been tentatively tested. From a study mentioned above, it’s clear that <strong>providing free and conveniently located childcare makes a colossal difference to women’s choices of whether or not to stay in STEM</strong>, alongside extended and paid maternity leave. <a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i10/why-cant-the-drug-industry-solve-its-gender-diversity-problem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Another</a> popular and successful strategy was implemented by a leading woman in STEM, Laurie Glimcher, a past Harvard Professor in Immunology and now CEO of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. While working at NIH, <strong>Dr. Glimcher designed a program to provide primary caregivers (usually women) with an assistant or lab technician to help manage their laboratories while they cared for children</strong>. Now, at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, she has created a similar program to pay for a technician or postdoctoral researcher for assistant professors. In the academic setting, Dr. Glimcher’s strategies are key for helping to alleviate the challenges associated with the individualistic culture of academia without compromising women’s research and leadership potential.</p>



<p>For me personally, I’m in the ideal situation for an academic woman. I graduated my BSc with high honours in four years, and with many awards. I’ve already had success in research and have published several peer reviewed papers. I’ve faced some mild sexism from peers and a couple of TAs, but nothing that’s seriously held me back. My supervisors have all been extremely supportive and feminist, and all of the people that I work with on a daily basis are equally wonderful. Despite all of this support, I’m looking at the timelines of an academic career, and the time constraints of female reproduction, and honestly, I don’t see how I can feasible expect to stay in academia and have the family life I want. And since I’m in the privileged position of being surrounded by supportive and feminist colleagues, I can say it: I’m considering leaving academia, if something doesn’t change, because even though I love it, I don’t see how it can fit in to my family plans.</p>



<p><strong>But wait! All of these interventions are really expensive. Money doesn’t just grow on trees, you know!</strong></p>



<p>It doesn’t in general, but in this case it kind of does — well, actually, we already grew it. We spend billions of dollars training women in STEM. By not making full use of their skills, if we look at only the american economy, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0894845318784745" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we are wasting about $1.5 billion USD per year</a> in economic benefits they would have produced if they stayed in STEM. So here’s a business proposal: let’s spend half of that on better family support and scientific assistants for primary caregivers, and keep the other half in profit. Heck, let’s spend 99% — $1.485 billion (in the states alone) on better support. That should put a dent in the support bill, and I’d sure pick up $15 million if I saw it lying around. Wouldn’t you?</p>



<p>By demonstrating that we will support women in STEM who choose to have a family, we will encourage more women with PhDs to apply for the academic positions that they are eminently qualified for. Our institutions will benefit from the wider applicant pool, and our whole society will benefit from having the skills of these highly trained and intelligent women put to use innovating new solutions to our modern day challenges.</p></div>
